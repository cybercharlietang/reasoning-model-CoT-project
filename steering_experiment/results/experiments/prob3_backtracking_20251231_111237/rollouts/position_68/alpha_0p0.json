By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4.

So adding those up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly. Sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which would throw off all the subsequent calculations. Let me recheck each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 Correct. Layer4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Correct.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, which matches our previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the total expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, so total expression=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9000 = 88048. Then, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Wait, that's different. Hmm, so my initial multiplication was wrong.

    "text": " So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I did it digit by digit, I think I might have made a mistake in the placement. Let me write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   -----------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me verify with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524. Adding units: 8 + 4 = 12, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, carry 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. 2 + 0 = 2. So, the sum is 88572. Okay, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or make an error in multiplication. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and building up. So, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 13 = 1 + 3*4\nLayer 3: 40 = 1 + 3*13\nLayer 4: 121 = 1 + 3*40\nLayer 5: 364 = 1 + 3*121\nLayer 6: 1093 = 1 + 3*364\nLayer 7: 3280 = 1 + 3*1093\nLayer 8: 9841 = 1 + 3*3280\nLayer 9: 29524 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nWait a minute, these numbers look familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I think these numbers might be part of a sequence, perhaps related to powers of 3 or something similar. Let me check if each term can be expressed in terms of powers of 3.\n\nLooking at Layer 1: 4. 3^1 + 1 = 4. Yes.\n\nLayer 2: 13. 3^2 + 3^1 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. Hmm, that seems to fit.\n\nLayer 3: 40. 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 121. 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1 = 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 121. Yes.\n\nSo, it seems that each Layer n is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, but the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify that.\n\nYes, the sum of a geometric series: sum_{k=0}^n r^k = (r^(n+1) - 1)/(r - 1). For r=3, it's (3^(n+1) - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with the layers we have.\n\nLayer 1: n=1. (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2. (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3. (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: n=4. (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, each Layer n is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^10 - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation for Layer 9. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with our step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, we can express the entire original expression as 3*( (3^10 - 1)/2 ) = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divided by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the early layers, let me recompute a few of them.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nMultiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps and they all seem correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks like a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. Let's consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, let's adjust the formula accordingly. Let me define the recurrence properly. Let me index the layers starting from 1 to 9, where layer 1 is a_1 = 4, layer 2 is a_2 = 13, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, for n >= 2, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression would be 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is correct. Just to recap, the key steps were recognizing the pattern, setting up the recurrence relation, solving it using standard techniques for linear recurrences, and then applying the formula to find the value at layer 9. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern can turn a tedious step-by-step computation into a more elegant formula-based solution. I think I'll stick with the formula method next time if I encounter a similar problem. It's quicker and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors when dealing with large numbers. But it's good to know both methods\u2014sometimes, in an exam setting, you might not have time to derive the formula, so being able to compute step by step is also valuable. Anyway, I'm pretty confident now that 88,572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses, each containing a similar structure.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. So, I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a solution of C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the equation: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. I think I'm confident with that now. I guess another way to look at it is that each layer is building up a geometric progression, which the formula accounts for. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern can lead to a more efficient solution rather than computing each layer step by step. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing step by step was manageable. If there were more layers, the formula would definitely save time. Anyway, I think I've got the right answer here. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost layer: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, I get 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.

Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 30000 *3 =90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So 90000 - (476*3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic. So, starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can notice that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. a_2=1 +3a_1=1+12=13. a_3=1+3a_2=1+39=40. a_4=1+3a_3=1+120=121. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} -1)/(c-1), assuming c\u22601. In our case, c=3, d=1. So, a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + 1*(3^{n} -1)/(3-1). Wait, but our initial condition is a_1=4, not a_0. Let me adjust that. Let me consider n starting from 1. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, etc. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} -1)/(c-1). But here, our a_1 is given, not a_0. So, perhaps I can write it as a_n = c^{n-1}*(a_1) + d*(c^{n-1} -1)/(c-1). Let me check that. For n=1: a_1 = c^{0}*(a_1) + d*(c^{0} -1)/(c-1) = 1*a_1 + d*(1 -1)/(c-1) = a_1 + 0 = a_1. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = c^{1}*a_1 + d*(c^{1} -1)/(c-1) = c*a_1 + d*(c -1)/(c-1) = c*a_1 + d. Which matches the recurrence a_2=1 +3a_1, since d=1, c=3. So, yes, the formula is a_n = 3^{n-1}*a_1 + (3^{n-1} -1)/(3-1). Plugging in a_1=4, we get a_n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} -1)/2. Simplify this: a_n = (8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} -1)/2 = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. Wait, because 8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} =9*3^{n-1}. So, a_n=(9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(9*3^{0} -1)/2=(9*1 -1)/2=(8)/2=4. Correct. n=2: (9*3^{1} -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (9*9 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9=(9*3^{8} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^8 first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, 9*6561=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form a_n=1+3a_{n-1}, which is a geometric series, and thus the closed-form formula can be derived as above. But since I already computed it step by step and verified it with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each set is 1+3(...), and the number of layers is 9, right? Because after each opening parenthesis, it's 1+3(...), and each time it's nested one more time. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution would be a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. I think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " So putting it all together, we have 8 8 7 5 2? Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because this seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer computation step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check Layer 9 again. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula here that I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, looking at the sequence of a_n: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term minus 2. Wait, let me check that: a_2 = 13, which is 3*4 + 1? Wait, 3*4=12, plus 1 is 13. Similarly, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, which is 3*13 +1=40. So the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, no, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1=4=C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me just cross-verify using the formula approach. Since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, that would correspond to n=9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer adds another factor of 3, so the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which can be expanded as 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 9 terms, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, no, because each term is nested, so it's more like a geometric series with each term multiplied by 3 each time, but I think the way I approached it with the recurrence relation is more accurate. Another way to think about it is that the expression is a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous one, starting from 1, and summed up n times. But in this case, since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), it's a bit different. But using the formula I derived, it's more straightforward. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step manual computation and the formula approach give me the same result. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This is similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recursive structure. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. First, write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the problem has 9 layers, each adding another 3*(...), we can model it as 3*(L_9), where L_9 is as above. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem, but I think the step-by-step method and the recurrence relation both lead to the same answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm applying the formula correctly. The problem is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*a_9, where a_9 is as computed. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*(29524):\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It resembles a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, starting from a_1 = 4 up to a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula derived from the recurrence relation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations because both methods led me to the same result.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested expression. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where each term is built by the previous term. Let's say a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the coefficients are constant, maybe we can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't recognize the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1 as 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. As I computed earlier, that leads to 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Another way to think about this is to recognize that each term is of the form (3^{n} - 1)/2, but that might be more advanced. Since I was able to compute each layer step by step without errors, and verified using the formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've considered multiple approaches and each one confirms the same result, so I don't think I made a mistake here.

Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer because that seems like a lot of steps, and it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. Let me just check the multiplication one more time to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that makes sense because each layer is just 1 plus three times the previous layer, and this builds up exponentially, so the numbers get large quickly. But by carefully computing each step, I was able to avoid mistakes and reach the correct result. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and proceed until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2**: Substitute Layer 1 into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. So starting from the innermost, which is \"1+3)\", then each previous one adds another. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences. From the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" before the final closing parenthesis. Wait, but when I started computing, I went up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But maybe I should check if the count of layers is correct. Let me parse the expression step by step. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's see: Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So starting from the innermost, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and each of those is a layer. So let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs before the first closing parenthesis. Let me write it down with indices: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, the first \"1 + 3\" is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(Layer). So, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 such instances before the first closing parenthesis. Therefore, my calculation of 9 layers leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. 3*29524: 29524 *3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Let's verify each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which would be faster and less error-prone. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, layer n has a value of (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, so the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, we arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps recognizing the pattern as a geometric series from the start. Let's see:\n\nThe expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), where the innermost part is 1 + 3, as before.\n\nBut perhaps expanding E step by step using the formula for a geometric series. Wait, in the recurrence approach, we saw that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as above.\n\nTherefore, E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this using multiple methods: step-by-step computation, solving the recurrence relation, and using the formula for a geometric-like series. All methods lead to the same final answer, so I'm confident that it's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1.

That seems correct. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Because if I have nine layers, that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is defined by: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for L(n). Let's try that. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n. To find a particular solution for the non-homogeneous part, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations to see if it's correct. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L(9), we have L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without manually calculating each layer. That's pretty cool. So, either way, whether by expanding each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify that with another method. 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nTo find another equation, let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13.\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow plug A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, we can write it as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3 =177144.\n\nThen, 177144 /2 =88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, and it gives the same result. That makes me confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors when computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, all correct. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using a different approach, perhaps expanding the expression step by step without using the formula, just to see if I get the same result.\n\nLet me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1+3*(4)=1+12=13.\n\nNext layer:1+3*(13)=1+39=40.\n\nNext:1+3*(40)=1+120=121.\n\nNext:1+3*(121)=1+363=364.\n\nNext:1+3*(364)=1+1092=1093.\n\nNext:1+3*(1093)=1+3279=3280.\n\nNext:1+3*(3280)=1+9840=9841.\n\nNext:1+3*(9841)=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, same result. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the entire expression can be represented as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the expression, each term inside is 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I let the entire inner expression be x, then the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). But since it's nested nine times, perhaps I can model it as a sum of 3^k terms. But I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me think: The expression inside is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but it's not exactly a simple geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. But in the recurrence relation, we saw that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which leads to the solution a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, since there are nine layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nWait, another way: Let me try to compute each layer step by step, but this time using variables to represent each layer.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nSo, L1 = 4\n\nL2 =1 + 3*4 =13\n\nL3 =1 +3*13=40\n\nL4=1+3*40=121\n\nL5=1+3*121=364\n\nL6=1+3*364=1093\n\nL7=1+3*1093=3280\n\nL8=1+3*3280=9841\n\nL9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSame result. So, I think I'm certain that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer using another method, like binary exponentiation or something, but I don't think that's necessary here since each step is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the expression using a calculator, but since I don't have one handy, I have to do it manually, which I've done step by step.\n\nWait, let me check if 3*29524 is indeed 88572. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the correct way to break it down because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So, adding up each part:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

But wait, let me make sure that I correctly computed each layer. I think I might have made a mistake in one of the layers earlier on. Let me go back and check each step again to ensure there's no error. Let's list out each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nNow, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check Layer 7 again because 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270+9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280, which is correct. Then Layer 8: 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, so 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Then Layer 9: 3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that all checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer step by step. Let me see if I can find a recursive formula or a pattern. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's solve the homogeneous equation first: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to compute each layer step by step, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But since in this problem there are only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable, but knowing the formula is useful for future problems. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern, I could derive a formula for the nth layer, which simplified the computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, the result is 88752. Therefore, the final answer is 88752. Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88752. Therefore, the final result should be 88752. But wait, let me check my multiplication again because sometimes when I carry numbers, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so write down 2 and carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 (from the first digit), then 8, 7, 5, 2. So the number is 88752. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait a moment, but let me compute 29524 * 3 in another way to confirm. Let's break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that's different from 88752. Hmm, that's a problem. So which one is correct? Let me check my addition here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in breaking down 29524. Let's see:\n\n29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Correct.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo according to this, 29524 * 3 is 88572, but when I did it digit by digit, I got 88752. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me figure out which one is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try that again more carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. So write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88752. But according to the breakdown, it's 88572. There's a conflict here. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when adding. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*      3\n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the result is 88752. But when I broke it down into parts, I got 88572. Hmm. Let me check the breakdown again.\n\nWait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that's 88572, but the digit-by-digit method gives 88752. There's a difference of 180 between these two results. That suggests I made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me check if 29524 is correctly broken down. 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. Correct.\n\nWait, so 29524 * 3 should be 88572. But when I do the digit-by-digit method, I get 88752. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me try it again:\n\n29524\n*      3\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo the result is 88752. But according to the breakdown, it's 88572. There's a conflict here. So perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it using another method, perhaps adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet's compute 59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding units place: 8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\nTens place: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\nHundreds place: 0 + 5 = 5\nThousands place: 9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carry 1\nTen-thousands place: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nWait, that can't be right because 59048 + 29524 should be 88572, not 88752. So that confirms that 29524 * 3 is 88572, not 88752. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me figure out where I went wrong.\n\nWait, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I think I might have miscounted the digits. Let me write it out again carefully:\n\n29524\n*      3\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 (units place) * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 (thousands place) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 (ten-thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the result is 88752. But when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572. There's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition method as well. Let me add 29524 + 29524 + 29524 step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524:\n\nLet's add digit by digit:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carry 1\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write 9, carry 1\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Correct.\n\nNow, add another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n0 + 5 = 5\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 write 8, carry 1\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nBut according to the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 88752. So where's the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing down the multiplication. Let me write it out properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    *       3\n    -----------\n      ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the result is 8 8 7 5 2, which is 88752.\n\nBut when adding, I get 88572. There's a conflict. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown method. Let me check 29524 * 3 using another approach. Let's compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n(30000 - 476) * 3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's 88572. So the correct answer is 88572, which means I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the positions when writing down the result. Let me write it out again:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    *       3\n    -----------\n      8 8 7 5 2\n\nBut when I add, I get 88572, which is different. Wait, 88752 vs 88572. The difference is in the hundreds and tens places. Wait, in the multiplication, I have 5 in the hundreds place and 7 in the tens place, but in the addition, I have 5 in the hundreds and 7 in the tens. Wait, no, in the addition, I have 5 in the thousands and 7 in the hundreds? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, when I added 29524 + 29524 + 29524, I got 88572. Let me write that out:\n\n29524\n29524\n+29524\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, so the correct result is 88572. Therefore, my digit-by-digit multiplication must have been wrong. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it out with proper alignment:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    *       3\n    -----------\n      ? ? ? ? ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 7 5 2, which is 88752. But that contradicts the addition method which gives 88572. There must be a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me count the digits in 29524: it's 5 digits. So when I multiply by 3, the result should also be 5 digits. 88752 is 5 digits, 88572 is also 5 digits. But which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 * 3 using a calculator to confirm. Since I can't use a calculator, I'll do it another way. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo that's 88572. Therefore, the correct result is 88572, which means my digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong. I must have made a mistake in that method. Let me check where.\n\nWait, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I wrote 8 8 7 5 2, but that's incorrect because when I compute 29524 * 3, the correct result is 88572. So perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing down the result. Let me try again, carefully:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    *       3\n    -----------\n      (4*3)=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n      (2*3)=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n      (5*3)=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n      (9*3)=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n      (2*3)=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the result is 8 8 7 5 2, which is 88752. But that's conflicting with the addition method. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it out with proper alignment:\n\n        2 9 5 2 4\n      *     3\n      ---------\n        8 8 7 5 2\n\nBut when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572. So, there's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me check each digit again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1. Correct.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7. Correct.\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1. Correct.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2. Correct.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8. Correct.\n\nSo the result should be 88752. But according to the addition, it's 88572. There's a conflict. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition. Let me check the addition again.\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524:\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n2 + 2 = 4\n5 + 5 = 10 \u2192 write 0, carry 1\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19 \u2192 write 9, carry 1\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Correct.\n\nNow, add 59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n0 + 5 = 5\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 write 8, carry 1\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So, the addition gives 88572, while the digit-by-digit multiplication gives 88752. There's a conflict. Therefore, one of the methods must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check each step again:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1. Correct.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Correct.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1. Correct.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2. Correct.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Correct.\n\nSo, according to this, the result should be 88752. But the addition method gives 88572. There's a difference of 180. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition. Let me check the addition again.\n\nWait, when I added 59048 + 29524, I think I might have miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n  59048\n+ 29524\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 write 5\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 write 8, carry 1\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo the sum is 88572. Correct.\n\nBut according to the multiplication, it's 88752. There's a discrepancy of 180. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me go back to the original problem.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) is the innermost. Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers earlier. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, so actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nBut according to the addition method, 29524*3=88572, but according to the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought it was 88752, which is wrong. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, so in my initial computation, I had 8 layers, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount the layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers, which means my initial computation was correct, and the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so earlier when I thought I had 9 layers, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, which is correct. But then, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought I got 88752, which was wrong. So, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step computation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the digit-by-digit multiplication gave me 88752, but that was a mistake. Actually, when I do 29524 * 3, it's 88572. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully checking, the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the innermost value is found to be 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back through my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier computations because if any layer is wrong, the final answer will be off. Let me recheck each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but perhaps for this problem, since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. But just for knowledge, the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, finding a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the inside out. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, but let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n   29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048.\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048.\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of each layer is as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount to make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate. Let's go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. It's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^10 is 59049, correct? Because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is 59049. Yes, that's correct. So, subtracting 1 gives 59048, dividing by 2 gives 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Yep, that seems right. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\). Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplifying the right-hand side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Rearranging: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above. So, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2: 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). Each layer can be computed step by step, starting from the innermost. Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation allows me to find a closed-form solution, which is more efficient, especially if there were more layers. In this case, with nine layers, it's manageable both ways, but the formula is quicker. So, computing each step carefully, I arrived at the answer of 88572. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident that this is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing that it is a nested set of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times another similar expression.

Hmm, each time, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. We have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula directly. Since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think that solidifies my confidence in the solution. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To be absolutely thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression using another approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, each layer is a recurrence relation: a_{k} = 1 + 3a_{k-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nGood, the formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we found before.\n\nThus, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 was 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found, but perhaps it's overcomplicating since we only have 9 terms. However, for future reference, let's see if we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to expanding (3 + 1) each time, but since it's nested, it's more like a geometric progression.\n\nBut in any case, the step-by-step computation seems solid, and the formula confirms it. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4.
