    "text": " Let's see, let me define a recursive formula. Let me define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, is there a closed-form formula for a_n in this recursion? Let's see. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, that's another way to get to the solution using the formula for the linear recurrence.

The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " Wait, that's similar to a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3a_p => 0 = 1 + 2a_p => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So that's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with my earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, to find a closed-form solution for a_n, we can solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

So, after 9 layers, we get 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.

    "text": " Let's see, the expression is built recursively. So, let me define a function a(n) where a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since n is small (n=9), computing each term step by step is feasible. Alternatively, the closed-form solution for a(n) can be expressed as a(n) = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for n=1, a(1)=4. (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2=1, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe that's not the right formula. Alternatively, perhaps a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches a(1)=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches a(2)=13. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a(3)=40. So yes, the closed-form solution is a(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a(9)=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a(9)=3*29524=88572. Therefore, using the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, that's another way to approach it, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. In this case, the recurrence relation is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a(n) = 3*a(n-1), whose solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 +1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula I used earlier. So, using this formula, a(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and then 3*29524=88572.

The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.

By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the value of each layer can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula for n=9, we find the innermost value, then multiply by 3 for the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Let me assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, simplifying: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B So, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Another way is to recognize that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is a linear recurrence, and we've already solved that using the formula.

So, a(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9, a(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a(9)=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have computed each layer step by step as I did initially, but recognizing the recurrence relation makes it much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since it's only 9 layers, both methods work. Either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

This is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our case, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods gave me the same result, which is reassuring.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me see: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as I computed before, a_9 = 29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's try to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which is a_3=40. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, let's compute a_9 using this formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the closed-form formula. But since I had to compute each layer step by step, that method worked too. It's interesting to see how the numbers grow exponentially because each layer is multiplied by 3. So, even though we have only 9 layers, the numbers get quite large quickly. I think I've got the correct answer here. Let me just verify once more by computing each layer again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4 Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13 Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with the innermost expression and moving outward. The recurrence relation for each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with the initial condition a_1 = 4. Using this relation, each subsequent layer is computed until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the result is multiplied by 3. The computation results in the final answer of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, it's a recursive formula where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me write this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we have a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

So, for our problem, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct.

Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Comparing to the general solution a_n = C*3^{n} + D, we have: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Subtracting C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Wait, but actually, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then each layer adds a new 1 + 3*(previous). So, maybe the general term can be expressed as a geometric series.

Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, so it's a geometric progression with ratio 3, but since each term adds 1, it's a bit more complicated. But by solving the recurrence, I found a closed-form expression which gives me the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same result.

The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.

Let me check: a2 = 13, which is 3*4 +1=13. a3 = 3*13 +1=40. a4=3*40 +1=121. Yes, so in general, a_{n} = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation.

Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B = right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1.

Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula. That might have saved some computation time, especially if the number of layers was larger. But for 9 layers, computing step by step is manageable. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap: Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. We compute each layer step by step, which gives us 29524 for the outermost parentheses. Then, we multiply that by 3 to get the final result, 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with the initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\), we derive a formula for the nth layer. Applying this formula to the 9th layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1.

Then the total is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So that's another way to compute it, using the formula. But since the problem is only 9 layers deep, computing step by step is manageable. But knowing the formula is useful for deeper layers or for a general approach. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 1 +3. We computed each layer step by step, which gave us a_9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just verify with another approach to be sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression by expanding all the parentheses. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 =4. Then, 1 +3*4=13. 1 +3*13=40. 1 +3*40=121. 1 +3*121=364. 1 +3*364=1093. 1 +3*1093=3280. 1 +3*3280=9841. 1 +3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. Alternatively, if I consider the expression as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Then, each time, it's 1 + 3*something. So, perhaps the entire expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Which is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))))))) Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe using substitution. Let me denote x = the innermost expression, which is 1 +3. Then, each layer is 1 +3*x, where x is the previous layer. But we already did that. Alternatively, perhaps I can see how many times 3 is being multiplied. Each layer adds a multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each layer out multiplies by 3 and adds 1. So, it's like 4, 13, 40, 121, etc. So, after 9 layers, we have 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. I think that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of exponents. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, the total number of multiplications by 3 would be 9 times, but the initial 1s also contribute. But I think the formula approach is better. Using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, for n=9, gives a_9=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let's suppose f(n) = C. Then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9 layers, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524=88572. So this confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me see: Let me define a recursive formula. Let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as before. So, for n layers, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just verify with another approach. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, as I did before, each step is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.
