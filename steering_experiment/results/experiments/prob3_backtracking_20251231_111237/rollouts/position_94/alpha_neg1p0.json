    "text": " This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^n*(a_0) + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so r=3, c=1. Let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the innermost one, but wait, actually in the original problem, the innermost is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Wait, in the original problem, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1, then each next layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So layer 9 would be the outermost one. Wait, but in the formula, a_n corresponds to the nth layer, starting from n=1 as the innermost. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Repeating this process up to layer 9 gives us 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, the solution would be a_n = (1/(1 - 3)) + (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^n = (-1/2) + (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^n = (-1/2) + (9/2) * 3^n. So, a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^1 - 1/2 = (27/2) - (1/2) = 26/2 = 13. Wait, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my general formula is off. Alternatively, perhaps the indexing is different. Let me consider n starting at 0. Let me re-examine. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1 (since the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, which would be a_1). So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. So, if we set n starting at 0, a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, the general solution would be a_n = (1/(1 - 3)) + (a_0 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^n = (-1/2) + (1 - (-1/2)) * 3^n = (-1/2) + (3/2)*3^n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, correct. For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, correct. So, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is a_9, which would correspond to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

    "text": " So, it's a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see what the closed-form solution would be for this recurrence. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method, I arrived at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6.

    "text": " So, it's a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but perhaps it's overcomplicating for just 9 terms. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression with ratio 3. Let me see: Starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Wait a minute, this seems like each a_n is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... up to n terms? Wait, let's check: Layer 1: 4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1 Layer 2: 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 Layer 3: 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 Hmm, that seems to fit. So, each layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, but wait, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 3^0 + 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2 is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. So, in general, Layer m is the sum from k=0 to m of 3^k. Therefore, the sum S = (3^{m+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{m+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer m, a_m = (3^{m+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me test this formula. For m=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches Layer 1. For m=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches Layer 2. For m=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which matches Layer 3. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer m is (3^{m+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, using the formula, the innermost is 1 + 3 =4, then each subsequent layer adds another multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can compute each layer as (3^{m+1} -1)/2, where m is the layer number starting from 1. So, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, as I did initially, and arrived at the same result.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the general solution. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's solve it step by step. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: At n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.

The general solution for such a non-homogeneous linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Setting a_n = D, then D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

The solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Let's try to model this. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, starting from a_1 = 4, as in Layer 1. So, more precisely, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants. To find C and D, we can use the recurrence relation. Plugging into the equation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Substitute the general solution: C*3^n + D = 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) + 1 = 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D + 1 = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Now, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Let's assume that as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n dominates, but since our n is finite, maybe we can find a pattern. Alternatively, since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write this as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.

The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1 is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous solution is solution to a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, just computing each layer step by step would also work, and it's straightforward. It's a good exercise in both iterative computation and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is layer 9, right? Because starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. So, n = 9. Then, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

To find the particular solution, since it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. The first layer, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4.

The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's substitute a_{n} = A*3^n + B. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, setting equal to a_n = A*3^n + B, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.

Wait, but in our case, the first term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So actually, the recurrence starts at n=1, a_1=4, and each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So the general formula for a geometric series with a recurrence a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n - 1} + c/(1 - r). Let me plug in the values: a_1=4, r=3, c=1. So, a_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n - 1} + 1/(1 - 3). Simplify denominator: 1 - 3 = -2. So, a_n = (4 - 1/(-2)) * 3^{n - 1} + 1/(-2) = (4 + 0.5) * 3^{n - 1} - 0.5 = 4.5 * 3^{n - 1} - 0.5.

    "text": " So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, we can find a closed-form formula. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since it's a constant nonhomogeneous term, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, that's consistent with what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, and using the formula, we can compute it directly without iterating each step.

    "text": " So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

    "text": " Each time, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For a linear recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1*k^{n} - c*(k^{n} - 1))/(k - 1). Wait, maybe I should derive it. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is Layer 3. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also check with smaller layers to see if the formula holds. For example, if I had only one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12. Using the formula: Layer 1=4, then 3*4=12. Correct. If I have two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))=3*(1 + 3*4)=3*(1+12)=3*13=39. Using the formula: Layer 2=13, 3*13=39. Correct. Similarly, three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))=3*(1 +3*(1 + 3*4))=3*(1 +3*13)=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120. Using the formula: Layer3=40, 3*40=120. Correct. So the formula seems consistent.

Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). In this case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, let's check: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. So the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting with a_1 = 4. So the general solution for this recurrence would be a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.

The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found as a_n = (3^n + 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k))*(k)^{n-1} - c/(1 - k). Wait, actually, let me recall the formula. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. Let me solve it step by step. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 holds for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have computed each layer step by step, which I did earlier, and arrived at the same result. So, whether by computing each layer or by finding a general formula, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). Solving this recurrence relation gives the general formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the innermost layer (Layer 1), this results in 4, and each subsequent layer is computed accordingly. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 yields the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " Each layer is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that approach. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, solving the recurrence: The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, from layer 1 to layer 9, but in our case, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as defined. Wait, let me clarify: The innermost layer is layer 1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then layer 2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.
