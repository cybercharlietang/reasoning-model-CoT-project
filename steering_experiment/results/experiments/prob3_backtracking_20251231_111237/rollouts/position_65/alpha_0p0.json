    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Maybe I should verify each layer computation. Let's go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9. Then, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This looks like a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), I can try a constant particular solution L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). Let me try to expand this step by step. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then, each layer adds 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to write this as a sum. Let me denote the innermost as S1 = 1 + 3. Then S2 = 1 + 3*S1, S3 = 1 + 3*S2, and so on up to S9. Then, the entire expression is 3*S9. From earlier, we have S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, S9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Thus, 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3 multiplied by a series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try to express this as a sum. Let me define the innermost term as S1 = 1 + 3. Then S2 = 1 + 3*S1, S3 = 1 + 3*S2, etc., up to S9. Then, the entire expression is 3*S9. As I found before, S9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*S9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I've checked it using two methods: step-by-step computation of each layer, and then using the recursive formula to find the general term and compute it directly. Both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, we find the innermost value to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. So, I think I did it correctly. Each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. It's a geometric progression of sorts, but each time it's 3 times the previous term plus 1. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), it's a nested expression where each layer is a + b*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series, but each term is scaled by b and then added a. The general formula for such a finite nested expression can be derived, I think. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for this. Suppose we have n layers, each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_k as the value at layer k, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Wait, I see that each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Let's solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: L_k^(h) = C*3^k. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a constant particular solution L_k^(p) = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, the formula for L_k is (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Since in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from the innermost as L_1 up to L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check if I computed Layer 9 correctly. Because if I messed up any of the layers, the final answer would be wrong. Let's recast the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again. 3*3280: 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9840. Then Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. That's correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), so the outermost operation is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Let me try to compute it another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all the layers. Therefore, a_9=29524.\n\nThus, the original expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this using the formula. Since the original expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That matches the earlier result. So, the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. But since it's a non-homogeneous recurrence (because of the constant term 1), the solution will have a homogeneous and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\), we compute each layer up to the ninth one, which results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again, just to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of layers. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and each layer is inside another. So starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have a new (1+3(...)) starting from the innermost. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost. So, I computed all 9 layers correctly. So, I think my answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's find A and B. Plugging in n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nWe can also find a second equation by considering the homogeneous solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form D. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which is exactly what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms my earlier computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve this, we can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's exponential growth, so maybe it's correct. Let me verify by computing a few layers again to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recompute Layer 1 to Layer 9. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, so that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by expanding the entire expression. But that seems impractical because it's nine layers deep. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, the expression can be seen as a sum of 3^n terms. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I let the innermost part be S = 1 + 3, then each layer out adds another 1 + 3*S', where S' is the previous layer. But I think this circles back to the recurrence relation approach, which we've already solved. So, I think the answer is indeed 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost.

But wait, let me confirm each step because sometimes when I'm doing arithmetic quickly, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.

Alternatively, I can compute 30,000 *3=90,000, but 29524 is less than that by 476. So 90,000 - (476*3)=90,000 -1,428=88,572. That's another way to confirm. So, yes, 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider that each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me denote L1, L2,..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2. And so on, up to L9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9. So, each Lk = 1 + 3*L(k-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Lk. The recurrence is Lk = 1 + 3*L(k-1), with L1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Lk - 3*L(k-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Lk^h = C*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Lk^p = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Lk = Lk^h + Lk^p = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. At k=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Lk = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Lk = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For k=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For k=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Lk = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is a geometric series, perhaps? Let's see if we can model this as a geometric series. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution as a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree, which makes me more confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, but since I didn't see it immediately, working step by step was a good approach. Either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which propagates outward. Let me go back and verify each layer. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, is there a closed-form formula for a_n? Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th layer, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute the result without having to manually compute each layer, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I only had nine layers, both methods worked. It's reassuring that both the step-by-step computation and the formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me quickly recap: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that looks correct.

Wait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it more carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, maybe there's a formula for such a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's see if there's a pattern or a recursive formula here. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, substituting the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Now, solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then adds 1. The formula we derived earlier is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is a closed-form expression for the nth term. Therefore, using this formula, we can compute a_9 directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I just need to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way. Let me quickly verify the multiplication at the end: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that gives 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 88,572 is the final answer. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the steps. So, I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using a recursive formula or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we determine the value of the ninth layer to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such sequences. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1, and a_1=4. Wait, maybe I should adjust the formula accordingly. Let me think. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8. So adding up: 40000 + 18000 = 58000, 58000 + 1000 = 59000, 59000 + 40 = 59040, 59040 + 8 = 59048. Now, add another 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524: 50000 + 20000 = 70000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 400 + 500 = 900, 40 + 20 = 60, 8 + 4 = 12. So, 70000 + 18000 = 88000, 88000 + 900 = 88900, 88900 + 60 = 88960, 88960 + 12 = 88972. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try again: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 88972. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in my addition. Let me check the addition again.\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524: Let's add the units place: 4 + 4 = 8. Tens place: 2 + 2 = 4. Hundreds place: 5 + 5 = 10, carry over 1. Thousands place: 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 (carry) = 19, carry over 1. Ten-thousands place: 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 (carry) = 5. So, 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Now, adding another 29524 to 59048:\n\n- Units: 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- Hundreds: 0 + 5 = 5.\n- Thousands: 9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n- Ten-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nWait, that gives us 88572. Wait, that's different from my previous addition. So, the correct total is 88572. I must have added incorrectly before. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just cross-verify this with another method. Maybe using the distributive property or recognizing a pattern. Alternatively, since each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer, perhaps this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each time, we have a term like 1 + 3*(previous term). Let's denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps we can find a general formula for a_i. Let's see: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our previous calculation. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe we can represent this recursively. Let me see if there's a pattern in the a_i terms. Let's list them:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 13\na_3 = 40\na_4 = 121\na_5 = 364\na_6 = 1093\na_7 = 3280\na_8 = 9841\na_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}. That's consistent with how we computed each layer. Now, solving such a recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form formula. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_i = c*a_{i-1} + d is a_i = c^i * a_0 + d*(c^{i} - 1)/(c - 1). In our case, c = 3, d = 1, and a_1 = 4. Wait, let's adjust for the indices. Since a_1 is the first term, perhaps the formula would be a_i = 3^{i} * a_0 + (3^{i} - 1)/2, where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, let me check that. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. The solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). So, in our case, a_1 = 4, so a_0 would be (a_1 - d)/(c) = (4 - 1)/3 = 1. So, a_0 = 1. Then, a_i = 3^{i} * 1 + (3^{i} - 1)/2. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me compute for i=1: a_1 = 3^1 + (3^1 - 1)/2 = 3 + (3 - 1)/2 = 3 + 1 = 4. Correct. For i=2: a_2 = 3^2 + (3^2 - 1)/2 = 9 + (9 - 1)/2 = 9 + 4 = 13. Correct. For i=3: a_3 = 3^3 + (3^3 - 1)/2 = 27 + (27 - 1)/2 = 27 + 13 = 40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_i = 3^{i} + (3^{i} - 1)/2. Simplifying that: a_i = (2*3^{i} + 3^{i} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{i} - 1)/2 = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. So, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. Let me test that: For i=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For i=2, a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For i=3, a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the general formula is a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1.

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Units place is 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place is 7, carry over 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Hundreds place is 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Thousands place is 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Ten-thousands place is 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88,572? Let me verify with another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if Layer 9 is 29,524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, but let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI count nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So each layer corresponds to one set of parentheses, right? So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost, I then multiply by 3. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. But just to be thorough, let me try computing it in a different way, maybe using a formula instead of expanding each layer. I notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the process, and the two different methods (step-by-step expansion and using the recurrence relation formula) both lead to the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, indeed, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Now, I can try to find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. In this case, k=3 and c=1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution, since c is a constant, can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nNow, the original expression is 3*a_9, so that's 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} =177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get 88572 as the final answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with each layer. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yep, that matches. So 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the original expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which would save me from computing each layer manually. Let's see if I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. The expression seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, no, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, etc. So this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The standard approach for such a linear recurrence is to solve the homogeneous equation and find a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we look for a particular solution, a_n^p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me count again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 sets of parentheses. So, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer, which is more efficient. But since the problem is only 9 layers deep, it's manageable either way. I think I've verified it sufficiently. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this as a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to find the value of each layer efficiently. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer's value by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the next inner term. There are 9 layers.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution**: Solving the recurrence, we find a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer**: For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems consistent. I think that's the correct answer. So, the problem was to compute this nested expression, and by breaking it down layer by layer from the inside out, I arrived at the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so 3*29524 should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me check my multiplication again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n---------\nCompute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Let me verify with another method: 30,000 \u00d7 3 = 90,000. Since 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000, so 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 90,000 - (476 \u00d7 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049; 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88,572. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 177147 -3 =177144. Divided by 2 is 88,572. Perfect.\n\nAlternatively, using the initial step-by-step computation, I arrived at the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), and each layer builds on the previous one. By computing each layer step by step, I found that the innermost value worked its way out to 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gave the final result of 88,572. Additionally, using the recurrence relation method confirmed the same answer, so I'm doubly sure that this is correct.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The problem was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down into smaller parts made it manageable. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to find a formula, which could be useful for similar problems in the future. I guess practice makes perfect, and these kinds of problems help in understanding how to approach nested expressions and recurrence relations.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by recognizing the repeating pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each step again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I could have recognized earlier to compute it without having to go through each layer. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, each layer is like a geometric series. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 /2 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Compute the innermost layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Work outward layer by layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3 by the result of Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but when I started, I had Layer 1 as 1+3, and Layer 9 as the outermost. So, that's correct, 9 layers. So, yes, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. Let me try a smaller version to see if the method works. Suppose I have 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Let's compute that. Innermost: 1+3=4. Next layer: 1+3*4=13. Next layer: 1+3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*(13)) = 3*(40) = 120. Correct. So, my method works for a smaller version. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, which is the innermost layer. Wait, no, in this problem, the innermost layer is L1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, in general, each layer can be expressed as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation, which might have a closed-form solution. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, the solution can be found using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Specifically, the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a solution of a_n = C*3^n. Then, finding a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous part, which is a constant. Let me assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Then substituting into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer L_n, where n starts at 1, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the innermost layer in the problem, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the problem has 9 layers, each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so the innermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

So, that seems right.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check the computation another way. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and it can be solved as follows. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nPlugging in n=1: a_1 = A*3 + B = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, we can set up the equation by plugging a_n into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a particular solution is a constant B, so:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nGiven that we have 9 layers (from Layer 1 to Layer 9), let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the recurrence relation, just to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with both methods: computing step by step and using the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 would be 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, for n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct again. So, the general formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 first. a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier result. So, using the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer without having to compute each layer manually, which is much more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check the arithmetic for 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's not the correct way to break it down. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.

Hmm, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. a_2=1 +3*a_1=1 +12=13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n + c1*a_{n-1} + ... = f(n). In this case, it's a_n =3*a_{n-1} +1. So, the homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =3*C +1. Solving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my layers because that's a lot of steps, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that could be generalized, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It's similar to a geometric series, but with each term being 3 times the previous plus 1. Wait, actually, this is a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. So, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me test for n=1: a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my formula is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. So, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since the original problem has 9 layers, the innermost being layer 1, and each subsequent layer wrapping around, the outermost layer would be layer 9. So, the value at layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of exponents without computing each layer. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Using the formula we found, each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step.

For the outermost layer (9th layer), this becomes \\( (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make this computation faster. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term of this sequence. Let's see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, we need a_9. Let me compute a_9: a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 5): Layer 6\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 6): Layer 7\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 7): Layer 8\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 8): Layer 9\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, there are nine layers, each computed correctly. So, I think my initial computation is correct, and the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say we have a similar expression with only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Compute this. According to my method: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Let's compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. Another example: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Compute this. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Direct computation: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my method works for smaller cases. Therefore, I'm confident that for nine layers, the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this. Maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that can be generalized. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572. It's reassuring to see that both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 *3=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all layers seem correct, so the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check if the number of layers is correct. The original expression has nine layers, each starting with 1+3(...). So, yes, I computed up to Layer 9. So, the final answer is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, resulting in 88572. Therefore, the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading up to Layer 9, which is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
