    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So, putting it all together, we have 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be more than 80,000. Wait, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Wait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute a couple of layers again. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 is 121. So, 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. That's correct. Layer 6: 3*364 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, we can see that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if there's a pattern or a formula that can give me a_n directly without computing each layer step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5)/2 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this way, after expanding all the way, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. Wait, but a_0 isn't defined here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the sum. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then expanding, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which becomes a sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=n. Wait, but let's see: Let's unroll the recurrence. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\na_{n-1} = 1 + 3*a_{n-2}\n...\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, but a_0 isn't defined. Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider that the expression for a_n is a geometric series. From the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, we can write it as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), where c is a constant to be determined. Expanding: a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. But from the original recurrence, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, substituting: 3*a_{n-1} + 1 + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Subtract 3*a_{n-1} from both sides: 1 + c = 3c => 1 = 2c => c = 1/2. Therefore, a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). This shows that the sequence b_n = a_n + 1/2 is a geometric sequence with ratio 3. So, b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}. From a_1 = 4, b_1 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, b_n = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (3^2)/2 * 3^{n-1} = 3^{n+1}/2. Therefore, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Which is the same formula as before. So, using this formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and solving it as a geometric sequence. This method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But for nine layers, both methods are manageable. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, the final answer is 87572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a calculation error.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 87572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can find another condition by computing L_2. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, when n=2, L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) and 9A + B = 13 (from n=2). Let's subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 \u21d2 6A = 9 \u21d2 A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 \u21d2 9/2 + B = 4 \u21d2 B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=87572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start. Since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Then, multiply by 3 to get 3*29524=87572. Either way, I arrive at the same answer. I think I'm confident now that 87572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{87572}"

Then, 3 * 29524 = 87572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recursive sequence? Let me think. The layers follow a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general form is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Hmm, but that doesn't seem helpful here because our initial conditions are positive integers. Maybe the method is a bit more involved, but perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let me consider the recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is similar to the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is given by L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(a - 1), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let me verify that. Let's assume L_n = 3^{n} * C + D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: 3^{n} * C + D = 3*(3^{n-1} * C + D) + 1 = 3^{n} * C + 3D + 1. Therefore, 3^{n} * C + D = 3^{n} * C + 3D + 1. Subtracting 3^{n} * C from both sides: D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = 3^{n} * C - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = 3^{1} * C - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, which is our outermost layer: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, using the closed-form formula saved me time and reduced the chance of error, especially since the expression has nine layers. It's a good reminder that recognizing patterns and recurrence relations can be really helpful in solving such problems efficiently. I think that's about it. I've computed each layer step by step, verified it with a closed-form formula, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final result is 88572. But wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me check. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let me count the number of times I see a new (1+3(...).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result without computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let's go through each layer again to confirm: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I think I did that correctly. Each step built on the previous one, and I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way. It was a bit tedious, but taking it one layer at a time made it manageable. I guess another way to approach this could be to recognize a pattern or a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step was feasible. If there were more layers, maybe a formula would be better, but for nine, step-by-step works fine. So, the final answer should be 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me compute it again in a different way. Alternatively, I can compute the entire expression from the inside out, writing each step as I go: Starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Then: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Then: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Yep, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive formula where each term depends on the previous one. This kind of structure is similar to a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added, it's a bit different. If I wanted to generalize this, maybe I could find a formula for the nth term, but in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each one step by step was straightforward. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for this. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works for all layers. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me even more confidence that the answer is correct. It's interesting how recognizing the recurrence relation can lead to a formula, which can then be used to compute the result without having to calculate each layer step by step. However, in this case, since there are only nine layers, the step-by-step computation was manageable. If there were, say, 20 layers, using the formula would be much more efficient. But for nine, both methods work fine. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, yes, 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Alternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or formula that can represent this nested expression without computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous, so we can solve it using standard techniques. The characteristic equation would be r = 3, so the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. To find B, we can use the particular solution. Let me set a_n = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get to the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad, though it's easy to make arithmetic errors, so double-checking is essential. Another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's similar to a geometric series but with an additional constant term each time. But in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one, the closed-form solution is more efficient. Anyway, I think I've verified it enough. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Let's try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's plug into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using a different method. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my step-by-step computation, and the formula method gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

But let me double-check my layer computations because I might have made a mistake there.\n\nLet me go back step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, that seems correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscalculate any layer. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I interpreted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n\nThen, (1+3(Layer1)) \u2192 Layer 2\n\nThen, (1+3(Layer2)) \u2192 Layer3\n\nAnd so on until Layer9, which is the outermost.\n\nYes, so the computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWe can write this as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using the formula:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which can be represented as a sum where each term is 3^k.\n\nBut perhaps it's overcomplicating since we already have a formula for L_n.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is 3*(Layer9), and Layer9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So using the formula, I also get 88572. Therefore, the answer is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, which would make the computation faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence to avoid computing each layer step by step. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, which is a linear recurrence. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is a_n = A*r^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in r = 3 and c = 1. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since there are 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. I think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me consider the recursive formula. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can see that each term is defined as 1 plus three times the previous term. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, which might help in computing a_9 without calculating each term step by step. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute a few more terms using the closed-form formula to ensure I didn't make any mistakes in solving the recurrence. Let's compute a_1 using the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly, which gives me confidence that my step-by-step computation was accurate. Therefore, multiplying a_9 by 3 gives 88572. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer here. It was a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but using the recurrence relation and solving it gave me a way to compute the nth term directly, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, and it helped me understand the pattern better. I guess the key takeaway here is recognizing the recursive structure of the problem and then applying the appropriate mathematical tools to solve it efficiently. It's also a good practice to verify the result using a different method, as I did with the recurrence relation, to ensure that there were no arithmetic errors in the step-by-step computation.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and substitute it into the next layer. Repeating this process for all nine layers, we arrive at the value of the innermost expression, which we then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me compute it as (30,000 - 480) * 3. 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. 480 * 3 = 1,440. So, 90,000 - 1,440 = 88,560. Wait, that can't be right because 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-wise calculation. Let me do it step by step again: 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it down: 8 (from 2*3+2), then 8 (from 9*3+1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3+1), then 2 (from 4*3). So that's 88,572. Wait, but when I did the other method, I got 88,560, which is conflicting. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the other method. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 directly:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Therefore, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of it as (30,000 - 480) * 3, I got 90,000 - 1,440 = 88,560, which is incorrect because 30,000 - 480 is 29,520, not 29,524. So, that's where I went wrong. Therefore, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but going back to my initial step-by-step computation, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me check if I correctly computed each layer up to Layer 9.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that looks correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, but in my earlier computation of Layer 8, I got 9,841, which is correct because 3*3,280 is 9,840, plus 1 is 9,841. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute that again to make sure: 9,841 * 3 = 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if I've correctly counted the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is one layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1+3(1+3(...)))\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that with another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3 (Layer 1)\n- Then, wrapping that is 1+3(Layer1) (Layer2)\n- Then, wrapping that is 1+3(Layer2) (Layer3)\n- And so on, until Layer9.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I ended up with Layer9 being 29,524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. But I want to make sure that I didn't miss any layers.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nStarting from the end:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which has one closing parenthesis.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another closing parenthesis. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the end:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, which ends with a closing parenthesis. That's one.\n- Then, the next layer is 1+3(...), which ends with another closing parenthesis. That's two.\n- Continuing outward, each layer adds another closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that the expression has nine layers of 1+3(...). Let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...), and each time, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each time, it's 1+3(...), where ... is the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3(...) occurs.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is multiplied by (1+3(...)), where the innermost is 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions:\n\n- The first one is 1+3\n- Then, the next is 1+3(1+3)\n- Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n- And so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the expression. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of \"1+3(\" sequences is 9. Let me check:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nYes, that's nine times. So, that means there are nine layers, each being 1+3(...). So, my earlier computation up to Layer9 is correct, and thus the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I've done this correctly. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner layer.

Wait, let me check again: 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2 \u2192 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Because each Layer is built upon the previous one, so let's retrace the steps to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each Layer is correctly computed, and then the final step is multiplying by 3, giving 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again because sometimes when I'm doing multiple steps, I might have made a mistake there.\n\nLayer 6 is 1093, so Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So 27000+2400=29400, +123=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute the entire expression in a different way. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me consider the general form. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier.\n\nSo, the sequence is a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, etc., up to a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what we got earlier. So, that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is building up a number that's following the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and after 9 layers, we get a_9, then multiply by 3.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently, both by step-by-step computation and by finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations. Both methods lead to the same result, so I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*(L_9)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} which is 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and compute each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if there are more layers in the future. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a repeated multiplication and addition. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested rather than summed. Alternatively, it can be represented recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). But in our case, the entire expression is 3*f(9), since there are nine layers inside the outermost 3. Let me check: f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 39 = 40. Yep, that's the same as before. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. To find f(9), we can compute it step by step, which we did earlier, getting f(9) = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see. The recursive relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. First, find the homogeneous solution: f_h(n) = A*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution f_p(n) = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, f(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, f(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which is especially useful if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work fine. I think I've got the correct answer here. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem was to compute a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3 times the next layer, and the entire thing multiplied by 3.

Wait, that's not matching my previous result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try again. 29524 * 3: Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1. Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0. Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1. Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2. Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Let me verify by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check the layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers.

Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is Layer1:1+3, then Layer2:1 +3*(Layer1), etc., up to Layer9, and then multiply by 3. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but considering the number of layers, it's plausible. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, L1 =1 +3, L2=1 +3*L1, L3=1 +3*L2, etc., up to L9. Then, the total expression is 3*L9. So, we can write a recurrence relation: L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, we can compute each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer up to the ninth, resulting in the value 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but nested. Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, up to a_9, and then the total is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the multiplier. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1}. Wait, but in this case, since r \u2260 1, the solution is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) * (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + initial term? Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently. Alternatively, since each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, we can write it as a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. So that's consistent with my earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute this without using the formula, by just expanding each layer, I could do that as well, but it's more time-consuming and error-prone. But since I already did it step by step earlier and got the same result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me recompute a few layers. Let's check Layer 5: a_5 =1 +3*a_4. a_4=121, so 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, everything checks out. So I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations because that would propagate through all the layers. Let me recast each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.

So, all steps seem correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this nested expression, so I can compute it without having to go through each layer manually. Sometimes, these kinds of expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWait a minute, this looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. Specifically, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we can confirm that the result is indeed 88572 without having to compute each layer manually, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nAlternatively, we can also recognize that each layer is a geometric progression. The expression L_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be seen as a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, but because each term is nested, it's a bit different.\n\nBut since we've already derived the formula and confirmed it with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time we add a layer, we're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is the same as the recurrence relation we solved earlier. So, each layer is building upon the previous one in a predictable way, allowing us to model it with a formula.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable layers and recognizing the recurrence relation, we can efficiently compute the value without getting lost in the complexity of the nested parentheses. This approach also highlights the power of mathematical patterns and formulas in simplifying what initially seems like a daunting problem.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\). By solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form formula and compute each layer step by step, leading to the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is nested with nine layers, each of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer}) \\).\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\( L_n \\) represent the value of the nth layer from the inside. The relation is:\n   \\[\n   L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Find the Closed-Form Solution:**\n   Solving the recurrence, we find:\n   \\[\n   L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Compute the Outermost Layer:**\n   For the 9th layer:\n   \\[\n   L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let's count the number of layers: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1), Layer3: 1+3(Layer2), up to Layer9: 1+3(Layer8). So, actually, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, when I computed Layer1 to Layer9, that's correct. Therefore, Layer9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.

Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something. Let me think. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a_1=4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: a_2=13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Subtracting the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A= 9/6= 3/2. Then, from a_1=4=3A + B: 4=3*(3/2) + B => 4=9/2 + B => B=4 - 9/2= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, indeed, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers.

Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but earlier when I did the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29524, so 3 times that would be 88572. But let me double-check my layer computations because if I made a mistake there, everything else would be wrong.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3 times that is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time, I see a 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then the next is layer 2, up to layer 9. So, yes, 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, 3*(Layer 9) is the total expression. Therefore, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and the total expression is 3*a_9, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step. It's a bit more advanced, using recurrence relations and formulas, but it's good to know that both methods lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), starting from the innermost layer.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because that seems quite large, and I might have made an error in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which we computed as 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so perhaps it's a type of recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can compute each a_n step by step, which is what I did earlier. Alternatively, the closed-form solution for such a recurrence can be found. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Let me see if that applies here. In our case, k = 3 and c = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1). Simplifying, that's (a_1 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Given that a_1 = 4, plugging that in: (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me compute this for n=9 to see if it matches the earlier result of 29524. So, for n=9: (9/2) * 3^{8} - 1/2. 3^8 is 6561. So, (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let's compute 9*6561: 6561 * 9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. Adding up: 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 + 9 = 59049. So, (59049)/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. Perfect, that matches the Layer 9 value I got earlier. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute a_n without having to compute each layer step by step. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but for more layers, the formula would be more efficient. Anyway, going back to the original problem, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524, which we found to be 88572. Let me just double-check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 (from the last digit), 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nThen, 500 * 3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\n\nThen, 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the final multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because if I messed up any of the layers, the final answer would be wrong. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. If I let a_n be the nth term, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given the structure, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward. Another way to think about it is that each layer is effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in base 3, but I'm not sure if that analogy helps here. Regardless, the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation both lead me to the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88572. I think I've double-checked enough steps, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term.

Hmm, but let me confirm with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't match my previous result. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is less than 30000 by 476. So, 29524 *3 = (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier digit-by-digit calculation. I must have made a mistake in my digit-by-digit method. Let me check again. 29524 *3: Let's write it out:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x        3\n   ------------\n     ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing from top to bottom: 8 7 5 7 2? Wait, that's 87572, but when I did the other method, it was 88572. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in the other method. Let me recalculate that.\n\nWait, 29524 *3: Let's do it as 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524.\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my digit-by-digit method, I got 87572. That means I must have made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me check the digit-by-digit again.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\nPosition: 5 digits: ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units.\n\nSo:\n\n2 (ten thousands place)\n9 (thousands)\n5 (hundreds)\n2 (tens)\n4 (units)\n\nMultiplying each digit by 3:\n\n4 (units) *3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 (tens)*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 (hundreds)*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 (thousands)*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands)*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing from the last multiplication to the first, it's 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So the number is 87572. Wait, but when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. There's a conflict here. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the addition again.\n\n29524 + 29524: Let's add digit by digit.\n\n29524\n+29524\n=?\n\n4 +4=8\n\n2+2=4\n\n5+5=10, write 0, carryover 1.\n\n9+9=18 +1=19, write 9, carryover 1.\n\n2+2=4 +1=5.\n\nSo, 29524 +29524=59048.\n\nNow, adding 59048 +29524:\n\n59048\n+29524\n=?\n\n8+4=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n4+2=6 +1=7.\n\n0+5=5.\n\n9+9=18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n5+2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nBut according to the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. So, there's a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Wait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x        3\n    -----------\n      ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom: 8 (from 2*3 +2), 7 (from 9*3 +2?), wait no, perhaps I'm misplacing the digits.\n\nWait, when you multiply, each digit's product is placed in the same position as the digit. So:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2 in units place, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7 in tens place, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5*3=15, write 5 in hundreds place, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8 in thousands place, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands place): 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8 in ten thousands place.\n\nSo the result is 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So the number is 87572.\n\nBut this contradicts the addition method which gave me 88572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 *3: Let's break it down differently. 29524 is 20000 +9000 +500 +20 +4.\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding these up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the digit-by-digit multiplication must have been wrong. I think I misaligned the digits when writing them down. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that my layers were correctly computed because that might have been the source of the error. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*(4)=1+12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*(13)=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*(40)=1+120=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*(121)=1+363=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*(364)=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*(1093)=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*(3280)=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*(9841)=1+29523=29524.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the outermost result by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but wait a moment, let me verify each layer computation again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, this is a recursive expression where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 ... Up to L_9, and then the total expression is 3*L_9. Now, I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3*C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers we've already computed. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is found to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number. Did I compute each layer correctly? Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, no. Let me see. The innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is the 9th layer. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I might have continued computing each layer manually, but using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form expression was much more efficient and less error-prone. So, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and applying the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value efficiently. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by recognizing a repeating pattern and using a recurrence relation.

The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, that formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it thoroughly, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it out properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x        3\n    ------------\n      ?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit (units place):\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit (ten-thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that seems high. Let me verify with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), so the first innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3(...) occurs. Let's see:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, a new layer is added. The original expression has 9 layers, as I initially thought, because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 such instances after the initial 3. So, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each computed step by step. So, Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it step by step again, writing each layer's value.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. I think I did it correctly. Each step builds upon the previous one, and I didn't see any errors in the calculations. So, the final result should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
