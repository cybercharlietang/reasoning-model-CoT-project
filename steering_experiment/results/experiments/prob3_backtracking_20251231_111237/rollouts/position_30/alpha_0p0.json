Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down, 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct.

Then 3*29524=88572, correct. So, all the steps check out. I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then proceeding outward. It's a bit tedious, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I guess another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each one individually isn't too bad. If it were a lot more layers, I might look for a geometric series or something, but in this case, nine isn't too bad.

But just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The structure of the expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might form a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works for each layer. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. That matches my earlier step-by-step calculation. So, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it without breaking it down into layers, I could recognize that each layer is a term in a geometric sequence. But since I've already solved it using two methods\u2014the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation approach\u2014and both lead to the same answer, I think it's safe to conclude that 88572 is the correct result. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident about this solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression, which might help confirm my result. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recursive formula here. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the Layer 9 result I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572, which is the same as I calculated step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Alternatively, I can compute 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a closed-form solution derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should break it down more carefully. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.

Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. That seems to be the answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem only has nine layers, it's manageable to compute each one manually. I don't recall a specific formula for this kind of nested expression, but perhaps it relates to geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each a_n can be computed recursively. However, since the number of layers is finite (nine layers), it's easier to compute each one step by step as I did earlier. If it were an infinite series, I might look for a closed-form solution, but here, since it's finite, step-by-step computation is feasible.

So, the final step is to compute: 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, that gives us 88,572. Hmm, but wait, let me confirm this because sometimes when I do multiplication step by step, I might make an error. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524. Let me verify that because the layers are building up, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the prior steps.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 (Wait, here I wrote 1093, which is 1,093. Yes, correct.)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 (correct)\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just check once more by computing the entire expression step by step, maybe using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the next layer. So, perhaps this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Each f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nWait, actually, in our case, Layer 1 is 4, which is f(1) = 4.\n\nThen f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 13, f(3)=40, etc.\n\nSo, in general, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nf(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nAssume f(n) = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, f(n) = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition f(1)=4.\n\nf(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nf(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, we arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nIf I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand it step by step, although this might get messy. But perhaps it can be represented as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let's see. Each time we have 1 + 3*something. So, if we expand it all the way, it would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))).\n\nThis is similar to the expansion of (3^{n} - 1)/2, which is the same as the solution we found earlier.\n\nBut perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, when we computed f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, that's the value after n layers. So, in our case, n=9 layers, so f(9)= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9)= 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, another way to look at it is that the expression is equal to (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series\u2014we arrive at the same final result.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this from multiple angles, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value after 9 layers is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093.\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280.\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841.\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n10. Multiply by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's break it down to make sure I don't make a mistake. 3 * 29524 = (3 * 20000) + (3 * 9000) + (3 * 500) + (3 * 24) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify that because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to miscount or make a multiplication error. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute any incorrectly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, which could save me time in case the number of layers increases. Let me think about the structure of this expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Wait, actually, it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the initial layers to make sure. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, matches a_2. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct, matches a_3. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form formula\u2014I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct result.

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a relation can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me count again. The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it, but this seems solid.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculation again because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572? Let me do it another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the earlier layers again because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Therefore, the final result is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute it another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found by solving the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works. So, for n=9 (since there are 9 layers), a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it both by expanding each layer step by step and by using a closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach to see if I get the same answer. Alternatively, I could recognize that this expression is a form of a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r is the coefficient and c is the constant term. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*r^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). So, in this case, K = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. The outermost layer is the 9th layer, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572, which matches the result I got earlier. So, this alternative method also gives me 88,572, which confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Yes, that seems right. I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could represent this, maybe a geometric series or something. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3L_p = 1 => -2L_p =1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've got it right. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a different approach. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). If I expand this, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on, nine times. So, if I expand all the parentheses, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))). Hmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps I can see the pattern. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, when I expand it, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms. Wait, but actually, the number of terms depends on how many layers there are. Since there are nine layers, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another power of 3. So, the expression would be 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1, because each layer is multiplied by 3 once more. Let me check: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n...\nSo, Layer n would be 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}. Therefore, Layer 9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. That's a geometric series with 9 terms, first term 1, ratio 3. The sum of a geometric series is (r^n -1)/(r-1). So, sum = (3^9 -1)/(3-1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier I had Layer 9 as 29524. Hmm, that's different. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, in the previous approach, Layer 9 was (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, but here, I'm getting 9841. That's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me clarify. If Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1. Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, indeed, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n-1 of 3^k. So, Layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. But earlier, using the recurrence relation, I had Layer 9 as 29524. So, which one is correct? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the recurrence approach. Let me check. The recurrence was L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 =4. So, L_1=4, L_2=13, L_3=40, L_4=121, L_5=364, L_6=1093, L_7=3280, L_8=9841, L_9=29524. So, according to the recurrence, Layer 9 is 29524, but according to the geometric series approach, Layer 9 is 9841. That's conflicting. Wait, so which one is correct? Let me check with n=1: sum from k=0 to 0 of 3^k =1, but L_1=4. So, that's different. So, the geometric series approach is not matching the recurrence approach. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the layers as a geometric series. Let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, the layers are indeed following the recurrence L_n=1+3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4. So, the formula I derived earlier, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, gives Layer 9 as (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, which is correct.\n\nOn the other hand, the geometric series approach was trying to model the sum of 3^k from k=0 to 8, which would be Layer 9 if each layer was just adding another 3^k term. But in reality, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is different. So, the geometric series approach doesn't directly apply here because the layers are not simply adding another power of 3 each time, but rather each layer is a function of the previous layer multiplied by 3 and adding 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct value is 29524 for Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, I think my initial step-by-step calculation was correct, and the confusion came from trying to model it as a geometric series, which isn't exactly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 =4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n1 + 3*(4)=13\n\nNext layer:\n\n1 + 3*13=40\n\nThen:\n\n1 + 3*40=121\n\nThen:\n\n1 + 3*121=364\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*364=1093\n\nThen:\n\n1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nThen:\n\n1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I had before. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute it using another method. Let's see, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have 9 layers, starting from the innermost. So, the expression is 3*(L9), where L9=1 + 3*L8, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, we can represent this as a sum:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I expand this, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) )\n\nBut expanding all of this would be tedious, but perhaps I can see a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is a function of the previous, and we've already computed Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expression as 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k * something). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but earlier I saw that the recurrence gives L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so for n=9, L9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, which is correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which matches.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is 3^{11} is 177147, subtract 3 to get 177144, divide by 2 to get 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it, using the formula for L_n.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple ways now, so I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, we have: 3*(29524) = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.

So, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have given me this result without computing each layer step by step, in case I ever encounter a similar problem with more layers.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer n is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive formula, and it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using methods for solving linear recursions, but since this is a simple recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is Layer n = 3*Layer n-1, which has the solution Layer n = C*3^n, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nThe nonhomogeneous part is a constant (1), so we can find a particular solution. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A  \nA - 3A = 1  \n-2A = 1  \nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)  \n4 = 3C - 1/2  \n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nLayer 1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nLayer 2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nLayer 3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3:\n\nLayer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula gives the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively scaling the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is building upon the previous one, leading to exponential growth, which is why the numbers get so large quickly.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute one more layer using the formula to see if it still holds. Let's say n=4:\n\nLayer 4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct as well. So, the formula seems reliable. Therefore, using this formula, I can compute any layer without having to calculate each step manually, which would be especially useful if there were, say, 20 layers instead of 9.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. It just requires careful arithmetic to avoid mistakes. I had to double-check each layer because it's easy to make a multiplication error with such large numbers, but each step seems consistent.\n\nAnother thing I might consider is whether there's a connection to geometric series here. The expression resembles a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me explore that.\n\nIf I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this completely, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Wait, but that's the same as the original expression. Maybe if I write it out in expanded form, I can see a pattern.\n\nLet me try expanding it step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write this as a sum, it might resemble a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach Layer n can be represented as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. If I expand this recursively, it might look like:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*1)...)))\n\nWhich is similar to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}, but not exactly because each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but the addition is nested.\n\nWait, actually, let me see. If I have Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), then expanding Layer(n-1) gives Layer(n) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*Layer(n-2)) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*Layer(n-2). Continuing this way, after expanding all the way to Layer 1, I get:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*(Layer 1)\n\nBut Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Wait, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with some adjustments.\n\nWait, using the formula I derived earlier, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is a geometric series sum formula. The sum of a geometric series is (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio. Here, r = 3, so the sum would be (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n} - 1)/2. But in my case, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, it's like the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each Layer n is effectively the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, if n=1, Layer 1 = 4. The sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k is 1 + 3 = 4. So, yes, Layer 1 is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 2 = 13. The sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. That's correct.\n\nLayer 3 = 40. The sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Perfect.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost Layer 9 is sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as we calculated earlier.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis approach using the geometric series formula is much more efficient, especially if there were more layers. It avoids the need for step-by-step computation and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. By recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to find the value of each layer quickly. Then, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified the solution in multiple ways. I'm confident that the answer is correct. It's interesting how recognizing patterns and applying known formulas can simplify what initially looks like a complex problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe label each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n- **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = ? Hmm, let me do that multiplication step by step. First, 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, and 3 * 4 = 12.

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. All steps seem correct. So, I think the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, yeah, that's how I would approach this problem. It's all about breaking down the nested expressions step by step, starting from the innermost part and working outward.

So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 27.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29,524. Let me compute that again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 Yes, that seems consistent. Hmm, but let me check using another method to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula that could help compute this without manually calculating each layer. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. The general form for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That's consistent with what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, my initial step-by-step calculation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's the right approach. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form solution also gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form solution from a recurrence relation, we arrive at the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the outermost layer is 3*29524=88572. Okay, so each step checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{next term})\\), repeated nine times.

I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed in a formula. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, Layer 2 = 13, Layer 3 = 40, and so on. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since the original expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which we computed as 29,524. Using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, that matches. So, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*(29,524) = 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} to confirm: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2,187 3^8 = 6,561 3^9 = 19,683 3^10 = 59,049 3^11 = 177,147 So, 3^{11} = 177,147. Then, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. Just to be thorough, let me make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let's count the number of times we have 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3: Layer 1\n\nThen, wrapping each time:\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9:1+3(Layer8)\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers in total. Therefore, using n=9 in the formula gives us the correct result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, no. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, actually, the outermost operation is 3 times Layer 9. Wait, no, because Layer 9 is the entire expression inside the first set of parentheses. So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result is 3*29524.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since the expression is finite with nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. If I were to generalize this, for n layers, the value would be (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check that formula. For example, when n=1: (3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches Layer 2. Similarly, for n=3: (81-1)/2=40, which is Layer 3. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9, so the value would be (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572.

Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way up. Using the formula for a geometric series, we confirm that each layer's value is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. Applying this formula for the ninth layer gives us 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13, 1 + 3*13 = 40, 1 + 3*40 = 121, 1 + 3*121 = 364, 1 + 3*364 = 1093, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, let's plug in n=0 for another condition, but wait, n starts at 1. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, each layer L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, the innermost layer is L_1 =4, which is (3^{2}-1)/2=4. Then, the next layer is L_2=13, which is (3^3 -1)/2=13, and so on up to L_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9). Let's compute L_9 using the formula: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, let's compute that: 3*(29524) = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty big. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, yes. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, yes. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, yes. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, that's right. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, okay, that seems consistent. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric sequence or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since this is a simple linear recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. Then 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute that: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me compute 29524*3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the answer. But let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer step by step. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in this case, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, c = 3, d = 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_0)*c^{n} + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition, say when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's another way to compute it directly using the formula. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I didn't make any calculation errors in my step-by-step computation, and the formula confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can simplify the computation. Each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For 9 layers, a_9 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, let's compute that: Final Result: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n(4*3)=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n(2*3)=6 +1=7\n(5*3)=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n(9*3)=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n(2*3)=6 +2=8\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify that with another method: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each set is: (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nI think I counted nine layers, but let me check the expression again.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n- The first term is 3(1+3(...)\n- Then inside that, another (1+3(...), so that's two.\n- Continuing, it's 3(1+3(1+3(...)), so three.\n- Each time I see a \"1+3(\", that's another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's nine \"1+3(\" instances, but each one is inside the previous. So, the innermost is the ninth, and then each layer wraps around. So, when I computed Layer 1 as the innermost, that's correct. So, computing up to Layer 9, and then multiplying by 3, which is the outermost 3. So, the process seems correct. Each layer is computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. So, the result of 88572 seems accurate. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with n layers. In this case, n=9. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can write a recursive formula: a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is: a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches my earlier computation. For k=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For k=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For k=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For k=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For k=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For k=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of a_9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the total expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, which is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a formula for a_n. Let me try to find a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to solve it as a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1.

Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, let me compute that: Total = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me do that multiplication. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, that gives 88,572. Hmm, but wait a second, let me verify that because 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3 is equal to (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression had nine sets of parentheses, right? So, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9. Let me recount: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then 3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression, so I don't have to compute each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049, 3^11=177,147. So, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same result. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Let's add them up step by step: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the result is 88572.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's do it another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result as before. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using another method, like recognizing a pattern or formula. Hmm, the expression seems to be a geometric series. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time we add 3 times the previous term. Wait, actually, it's more like each term is 1 + 3*(next term). But since we're starting from the innermost, maybe it's better to model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I did before. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a finite number of terms, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, the closed-form formula for a_n would be a geometric series. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous, so we can solve it using standard techniques. The characteristic equation is r = 1 + 3r, which would be r - 3r = 1 => -2r = 1 => r = -1/2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because our terms are increasing, not decreasing. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4/2) -1/2 = (81/2) -1/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Wait, no. Wait, in our initial computation, we started with layer 1 as 1 + 3 = 4, which is the innermost. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous). So, layer 1 corresponds to n=1, layer 2 to n=2, up to layer 9 corresponding to n=9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier computation. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading from top to bottom: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Continue this process for each subsequent layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result by 3:  \n   \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
