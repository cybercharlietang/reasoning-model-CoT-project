Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially. Either way, the answer comes out to be 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. For example, in Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, if I didn't think of the formula, computing each layer step by step is also feasible, especially since there are only nine layers. It might be a bit tedious, but it's straightforward. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the step-by-step computation. Starting from the inside: Layer 1:1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I could also think about the entire expression as a sum of 3^n terms, but that might complicate things. Wait, let me see. Each time we have a term like 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some terms. But in this case, it's a bit different because each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, so it's not a simple geometric series. However, using the recurrence relation and solving it as I did before gives a neat formula, which is much faster than computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, computing step by step is manageable. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. To be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 *3: 29524 *3.

So, adding up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.

Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, the innermost layer is a_1=4, the next is a_2=13, up to a_9. Since the entire expression is 3*a_9, let's compute a_9 first. a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Then, 3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring.

    "text": " a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which is correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So yes, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. I think that confirms that the answer is correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence relation, we can efficiently solve it. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), leading to a closed-form solution. Calculating each step or using the formula confirms the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost outward**:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"
