Wait, in our case, we have 9 layers, but let me check: Wait, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct. Then Layer 2: a_2 = 13, which would be (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: a_3 = 40, which is (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer n: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the value inside the outermost 3*() is 29524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.

Starting from the innermost Layer 1, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let's count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count them: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first closing parenthesis. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1 + 3( occurs. Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time we have a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3(\n\nWait, but after the ninth \"3(\", the next part is 1 + 3), so that's the innermost. So, actually, there are nine layers, each corresponding to one of these. So, n = 9. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to be thorough, let me verify the formula again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The closed-form solution is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n=1, (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2, (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2=13. For n=3, (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3=40. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
