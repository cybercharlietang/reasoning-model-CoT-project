    "text": " a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, without using the formula, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like each step is 3*(previous) +1. So, starting from 4, each layer is 3*previous +1. But either way, the result is the same. I think I've verified it enough times. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we can compute each subsequent layer. After computing all layers, we find the innermost value and work our way out. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7.

Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... )))). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1 + 3, then layer 2 wraps around that, up to layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.

So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression.
