    "text": " So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify that with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if I messed up any layer, the final answer will be wrong. Let's go through the layers again to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this problem as a geometric series, but since it's nested, it's more of a recursive computation. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. Suppose we have a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*r^n + D, where r is the common ratio. Let's find the characteristic equation. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + D.\n\nNow, we can find D by substituting into the nonhomogeneous equation. Plugging a_n = C*3^n + D into a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1: (C*3^n + D) - 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 => C*3^n + D - 3*C*3^{n-1} - 3D = 1 => C*3^n - 3*C*3^{n-1} + D - 3D = 1 => C*3^n - C*3^n + (-2D) = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, and the outermost is Layer 9, which corresponds to n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and plan to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation.\n\n3. After computing the innermost layers up to Layer 9, multiply by 3 as per the original expression.\n\n4. To ensure accuracy, I also approached the problem using a recurrence relation and derived a formula, which confirmed the result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. But L_n is also equal to A*3^n + B, so: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, each layer L_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer without computing each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\). By deriving a closed-form formula, we find that each layer \\( L_n \\) can be expressed as \\( \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for the outermost layer (n=9) and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is defined as \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Derive the closed-form formula**: Using the recurrence relation, we find \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute the outermost layer**: For \\( n=9 \\), \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P \u2192 P - 3P = 1 \u2192 -2P =1 \u2192 P = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =8/2=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524 \u2192 which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, and also using a formula for the recurrence relation, which gives the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer until reaching the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, no, that's not correct because 29,524 * 3 is 88,572? Let me verify with another method. 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. So, 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 29,524 * 3 = 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. But let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, when I computed Layer 1 through Layer 9, that's correct. Each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, I think my computation is accurate. Let me just confirm each step once more:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems consistent. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. I just had to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way. Let me quickly recap the process: 1. Start with the innermost parentheses and work outward, computing each layer step by step. 2. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). 3. After computing the outermost layer (Layer 9), multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression. 4. Verify each step to avoid mistakes. This systematic approach helped me tackle the problem without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the nested expressions.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, then multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    Multiply the result by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, let's write it out: 2 9 5 2 4 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, wait, but let me double-check each layer because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer again to make sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me denote L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a pattern. Let's compute the first few terms:\n\nL1 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's similar to 3^n, but adjusted by the +1 at each step. Let's see if we can model this. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. The homogeneous solution would be solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^(2))/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, L9 would be (3^(10))/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which can be represented as a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression without using layers. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). This is a finite geometric series with 9 terms. Wait, actually, each time we have a term that's 1 + 3*(next term). Let me see if I can represent this as a sum. Let me denote S as the entire expression. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Let me see if I can find a pattern or express S in terms of a geometric series. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and we have 9 layers, maybe I can express S as 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Wait, let me think. If I expand the expression, each layer adds a power of 3. Let me try expanding the innermost part first. The innermost is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. It seems like each layer adds another power of 3. So, after n layers, the expression inside would be the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, but in our case, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 3^0 + 3^1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, each layer adds one more term, which is 3^n. So, for Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\nLayer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n...\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^9\n\nWait, but in our problem, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2. Similarly, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, each Layer n is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, but starting from k=1? Wait, no. Wait, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1. Layer 2 is 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2. So, Layer n is the sum from k=1 to n+1 of 3^k? Wait, no. Let me see: Layer 1: sum from k=1 to 1: 3^1 = 3, but Layer 1 is 1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1. So, it's 1 + sum from k=1 to 1 of 3^k. Layer 2: 1 + sum from k=1 to 2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9. Similarly, Layer 3: 1 + sum from k=1 to 3 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. So, in general, Layer n is 1 + sum from k=1 to n of 3^k. But wait, in our case, we have 9 layers, but the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2. So, Layer n is 1 + sum from k=1 to n of 3^k. Therefore, Layer 9 would be 1 + sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^(n+1) - 1)/ (3 - 1) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. But in our case, Layer n is 1 + sum from k=1 to n of 3^k, which is equal to sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Because 1 is 3^0. So, Layer n = sum from k=0 to n of 3^k = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to think about it using the geometric series formula. This seems more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, as it avoids computing each layer individually. I think I've got this. The answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute each layer step by step. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3 times the previous layer. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

    "text": " So putting it all together: 87572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 87572. Hmm, but let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Oh no, I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication. So the correct result is 88572, not 87572. Let me see where I went wrong. When I did it step by step, I think I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo writing it out: 87572. But according to the other method, it's 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check which one is correct.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nBut when I did it digit by digit, I got 87572. So where did I go wrong? Let me check the digit-by-digit multiplication again.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 has digits: 2,9,5,2,4. So when multiplying, the digits are:\n\n4 (units place) \u2192 2 (tens place) \u2192 5 (hundreds place) \u2192 2 (thousands place) \u2192 9 (ten thousands place) \u2192 2 (hundred thousands place). Wait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying, the digits are processed from right to left: 4, 2, 5, 9, 2.\n\nWait, no, actually, when writing the number as 29524, the digits are:\n\nPosition: 10000  1000  100  10  1\n\nDigits:     2      9     5    2   4\n\nSo when multiplying by 3, starting from the units place (4):\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo writing it down: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 7 (units), 2 (carry over from units). Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, let me write it out properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572, which matches the earlier calculation. So I must have made a mistake in my initial digit-by-digit multiplication by not correctly placing the digits. So the correct final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because I don't want to make a mistake here. So, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute it another way: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the layers again because I might have miscalculated one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So that's the final answer.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nHow many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, there are 8 more \"1+3(\" before the innermost 1+3. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses. Each opening parenthesis must have a closing one. The expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, there are 9 layers, which I numbered from 1 to 9. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost. So, that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute Layer 9 again:\n\nLayer 8 is 9841, so Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: As computed, 29524*3=88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since we're dealing with only 9 terms, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 can be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe general solution is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find D, set a_n = D, then D = 3*D + 1 \u2192 D - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost result by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. a_2=1 +3*a1=1+12=13. a3=1+3*a2=1+39=40. And so on. This seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help me compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C -3C =1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A -1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Thus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, either way, I get 88,572 as the final answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, yeah, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3 * 0 = 0. Wait, actually, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4. Let me write it as 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, the result is 88,572. Let me check that: 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote L(n) as the value of layer n. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, L(1) = 4 L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, yeah, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final step is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177,147. Therefore, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572. I think I've double-checked it enough, so I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost layer and work our way outwards. Once all layers are computed, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, so it seems like each step checks out. Therefore, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this with a recursive formula.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent term is built by this recurrence relation.\n\nWait, but actually, in our case, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, for n=1, a_1=4; n=2, a_2=13; n=3, a_3=40; and so on up to a_9=29524.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. This makes me confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me explore that angle.\n\nGiven the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nExpanding this recursively:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this expansion:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a_{n-3}\n\nAnd so on, until we reach a_1 = 4.\n\nTherefore, for a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{8} + 3^9*a_0\n\nWait, but a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1, so a_0 would be 1? Let me check.\n\nFrom the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, if n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. We know a_1=4, so 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => 3*a_0=3 => a_0=1.\n\nTherefore, a_n can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0\n\nSince a_0=1, this becomes:\n\na_n = (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1) + 3^n*1\n\nWait, hold on. The sum 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} is a geometric series with sum (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 + 3^{n} = (3^{n} -1 + 2*3^{n})/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWhich is the same formula we derived earlier. Therefore, this method also leads us to the same conclusion.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this problem from multiple angles, both computationally and analytically, and each method leads me to the same result. Therefore, I can be certain that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, ultimately leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4.

So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to verify.

Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Each time, it's 1+3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of 1+3(...): There are 9 instances of 1+3(...). So, Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, I think I did that correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.

Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 29523 +1 = 29524.

Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nGiven a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the standard approach, the initial condition is given at n=0 or n=1. Here, a_1 = 4, so let's set n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms our earlier result using a different method. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each layer's value. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a formula to find the value of the innermost layer efficiently. Multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I think I might have made a mistake because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and I started from layer 1 as 1 + 3 = 4, then layer 2 as 1 + 3*4 = 13, layer 3 as 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to layer 9 as 29524.

So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions like 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1\n\nAnd so on. So each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. This is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTesting for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes when computing 3^10. Let's compute 3^10 step by step:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3^10 is indeed 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(...), so the outermost operation is multiplying the entire nested expression by 3. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula or a geometric series here. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution and particular solution approach is needed. Let me try solving the recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression to see if it can be represented as a sum of powers of 3. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding it:\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. Then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, each 1 will be multiplied by 3 raised to the power corresponding to its depth. Let me try to see the pattern.\n\nLet me write E as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I expand each layer, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n...\nAs before.\n\nBut if I expand E fully, it's equivalent to:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nExpanding each 1 as you go outwards:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand it step by step:\n\nFirst, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, each layer can be expressed as 1 + 3*(previous), and when expanded, each 1 contributes 3^k for the k-th layer from the inside.\n\nAlternatively, when fully expanded, E would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nLet me try to write it as a sum:\n\nEach time you have a 1 inside, it gets multiplied by 3 each time you go up a layer. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nWait, let me think about that. Since there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), the innermost 1 is at layer 9, so when fully expanded, it would be multiplied by 3^8, because each layer up adds a multiplication by 3. Similarly, the next 1 would be at layer 8, multiplied by 3^7, etc., down to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0.\n\nSo, the total sum inside the outermost 3*(...) would be:\n\n1*3^8 + 1*3^7 + 1*3^6 + ... + 1*3^0.\n\nThat is, the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k. Because 3^8 is the innermost, and 3^0 is the outermost.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you expand, each 1 is at a different depth. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each 1 in the expression contributes 3 raised to the number of layers above it. For example, the innermost 1 is in layer 1, and each layer above it multiplies by 3, so when expanded, that 1 is multiplied by 3^8 (since there are 8 layers above it). Similarly, the next 1 is in layer 2, so it's multiplied by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1, which is in layer 9, so it's multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k. So, the sum S = 3^8 + 3^7 + ... + 3^0.\n\nWe know that the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Here, n=8, so S = (3^9 -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E = 3*S = 3*(3^9 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, S = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nTherefore, E = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but earlier I got 88,572. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because the sum S is the sum inside the outermost 3*(...). So, E = 3*S = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ) = (3^10 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^10=59049. So, E = (59049 -3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523. Wait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I had E = 3*29524=88572. That doesn't match. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps my approach here is incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I computed the layers step by step, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, then E=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut using the geometric series approach, I'm getting E=29523. So, clearly, one of them is wrong. Let me check my geometric series approach again.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is in how I'm counting the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the original expression, the innermost part is 1+3, which is Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nNow, in the geometric series approach, I thought that the sum inside the outermost 3*(...) is sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2=9841.\n\nBut in reality, when you expand the expression, each 1 is at a different depth. Let me try to write out the expansion step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this step by step:\n\nFirst, the innermost 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 +3*(previous result).\n\nSo, after expanding each layer, we have:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, when expanding the entire expression E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))).\n\nIf I expand all the parentheses, each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers above it. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0.\n\nTherefore, the sum inside the outermost 3*(...) is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, which is (3^9 -1)/2=9841.\n\nThen, E=3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the step-by-step computation where E=88572.\n\nSo, clearly, one of these approaches is wrong. Let me see where the mistake is.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how many layers there are. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first 1+3(...), that's layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, but actually, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside the first 3*(...), there's a 1+3*(...), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another 1+3*(...), and so on, until the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 9.\n\nWait, no. Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears inside the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen moving out, each 1+3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, the expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Therefore, when I computed up to layer 9, I had 29524, and E=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in the geometric series approach, I considered the sum inside the outermost 3*(...) as sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, which is 9841, and then E=3*9841=29523, which is different.\n\nSo, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that in the geometric series approach, the number of terms is 9, but the exponents go from 0 to 8, which is correct. But when I computed step by step, I ended up with E=88572, which is 3*29524.\n\nBut according to the geometric series, E should be 3*(sum_{k=0}^8 3^k)=3*(9841)=29523.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step computation, the outermost layer after 9 layers is 29524, so E=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, which one is correct? Let me check with smaller n.\n\nSuppose n=1: E=3*(1+3)=3*4=12.\n\nUsing the geometric series approach: sum inside is 1+3^0=1+1=2. Then E=3*2=6. Wait, that's not matching.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, when n=1, the expression is 3*(1+3)=12, but the geometric series approach gives 3*(sum_{k=0}^0 3^k)=3*(1)=3, which is wrong. So, clearly, the geometric series approach isn't applicable here, or I'm misapplying it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the layers contribute. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum inside the outermost 3*(...) is not sum_{k=0}^{8}3^k, but rather something else.\n\nLet me think differently. Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe can write a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to express E as a sum, it's 3*(a_9).\n\nBut when I tried to expand E as a sum of 3^k terms, I got a different result, which suggests that approach was incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to use the recurrence relation and compute each layer step by step, leading to E=88572.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with n=2.\n\nIf n=2, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1+3))=3*(1+3*4)=3*(13)=39.\n\nUsing the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nFor n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, then E=3*a_2=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3, E=3*a_3=3*40=120.\n\nWhich is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1+3)))=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))=3*(1 +3*13)=3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works, and thus for n=9, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count how many times we have 1 + 3(...):\n\nFrom the innermost, Layer 1: 1 + 3\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then multiplied by 3. So, the computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to building a geometric series. But in this case, since it's a finite number of layers, the closed-form approach using the recurrence relation seems more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which can be expanded as a_n = 3^n*a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2, but since a_1 = 4, which is when n=1, we have a_1 = 3*4 + 1? Wait, no, that's not the way.\n\nWait, actually, from the recurrence relation, we found that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct. So, yes, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now. Each step checks out, and the closed-form formula confirms the step-by-step computation. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with the initial condition \\(a_1 = 4\\), we derive a closed-form solution \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 3 * 0 (since there's no digit beyond 29524) = 0, but wait, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it as 29524. So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 9*3=27, so 7 with carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the number is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me go back a bit. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me make sure I computed each layer correctly because if any layer was wrong, the final answer would be off. Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Setting a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, recurrence relation, and even using a formula for the recurrence. All methods lead to the same result.

So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have nine layers. Let me count the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: innermost: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So yes, that's correct. So, 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is small (only 9), computing each step is feasible. However, for larger numbers, we might need a formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved as follows:\n\nThe homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nA particular solution: since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=1 corresponds to a_1 = 4, then n=9 would correspond to a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nBut let's compute a_9 using the closed-form:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so:\n\na_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, putting it all together, the innermost layer was 4, each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer), and after computing up to Layer 9, which was 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a multiplication error. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer and finally multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nStarting from the units place:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Maybe by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet's add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12.

Okay, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer was computed as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Maybe I should compute each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the layers check out. So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572, which should be the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n \u2265 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0 \u21d2 r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, the value of the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince the original problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me see: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is to recognize the pattern and use the formula for the nth term, then multiply by 3. That might be more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad, but it's easy to see how the formula would save time if the problem had more layers.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n\n3. After computing the outermost layer (layer 9), multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n4. Verify the result using an alternative method (direct multiplication) to ensure accuracy.\n\n5. Additionally, derive a general formula for the nth layer to confirm the result and understand the pattern better.\n\nThis approach seems solid, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula lead to the same final answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then tripling the previous amount. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. The formula we derived earlier, (3^{n+1} -1)/2, is actually the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 and having n+1 terms, minus 1, divided by 2. Let me confirm that:\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^{k} -1)/(r -1), where a is the first term, r is the ratio, and k is the number of terms.\n\nIn our case, each layer is built by adding 1 and tripling, so it's like each step is adding a term of 3^m where m increases each layer. Let me see:\n\nFor layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly a geometric series. Alternatively, the formula we derived, (3^{n+1} -1)/2, can be seen as the sum of a geometric series where each term is 3^k from k=0 to k=n, but adjusted by the constants involved.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating it. The key takeaway is that we can model the problem with a recurrence relation, solve it, and then apply it to find the result without computing each layer manually, which is especially useful for larger n.\n\nIn any case, whether by direct computation or by using the formula, the result is 88572. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. The outermost layer is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but 29524 * 3 is actually 88572, right? Let me verify with another method. 30000 * 3 = 90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and check my layers because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which would throw off all the subsequent layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I might consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution for n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 \u2192 6A = 9 \u2192 A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 \u2192 9/2 + B = 4 \u2192 B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to make sure, let me compute one more layer manually to check. Let's say Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer6. Layer6 was 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280, which matches. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, which is correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, yes, all layers check out. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value grows exponentially, leading to the final result after multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's 9 sets. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and working out, each layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, 9 layers in total. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. For example, let's say I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))).

Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9 for the outermost layer. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. This confirms that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, the step-by-step process is: 1. Recognize the nested structure and compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Each layer follows the formula L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1=4. 3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using recurrence relations to find L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. 4. For n=9, compute L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. 5. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524=88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Maybe there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression using the formula. Since each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern and applying a formula for a geometric series. By evaluating each layer step by step or using the derived formula, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me verify this because when I did the earlier steps, I might have miscalculated Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.

Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recursion. Suppose we have a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Wait, that seems off because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so let's do it step by step:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\nLet's multiply each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that again because I think I might have miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 thousands digit is 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 ten-thousands digit is 7, carryover 2.\n\nBut wait, 29,524 is 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when we multiply:\n\n2 (ten-thousands place) \u00d7 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 = 8 \u2192 hundred-thousands place.\n\nSo the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 30,000 \u00d7 3 is 90,000, so 29,524 \u00d7 3 should be just under 90,000, which 88,572 is. Alternatively, 29,524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the outermost layer was 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So that would be the final answer.\n\nBut let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29,524, but actually, 3*9841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, when I multiplied 3*29524, I got 88,572, but let me check that again. 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the number is 88,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 \u00d7 3 is 88,572. Let me confirm with another method. 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down as (30,000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer, I end up with 88,572 as the final answer.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the expression was 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29,524, so 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, there's a 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3(...) appears.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, when I started, I labeled Layer 1 as 1 + 3, which is the innermost, and Layer 9 as the outermost. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, that was correct, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps there's a geometric series involved here. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches L_1.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches L_2.\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches L_3.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Calculating each layer step by step or using the closed-form solution leads us to the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So putting it together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the carry-over. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but given the number of layers, it might make sense. Let me just verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me think about solving this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equating the coefficients: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L9, would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute L9 directly, which would have saved time. But since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a good way to verify the process. In conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented by a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*(3)^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, how many layers do we have? Let me see. The innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so layer 1 up to layer 9. So, n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so starting from the innermost, each term is 3 times the previous. So, the innermost is 4, then 13, 40, etc., each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. But I think the recurrence relation method is more straightforward here. So, to recap, by either computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " So, putting it all together: 87572. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again: 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, it's 87572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication.\n\nWait, let me add 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4+4=8\n\n2+2=4\n\n5+5=10, write 0, carry 1\n\n9+9=18 +1=19, write 9, carry 1\n\n2+2=4 +1=5\n\nSo, 59048. Then, adding another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8+4=12, write 2, carry 1\n\n4+2=6 +1=7\n\n0+5=5\n\n9+9=18, write 8, carry 1\n\n5+2=7 +1=8\n\nSo, 88572. Therefore, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication. Let me check why.\n\nEarlier, I thought 29524*3=87572, but adding 29524 three times gives 88572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 * 3 properly:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nBut when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me check the addition again.\n\nWait, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nLet's add digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 +1=7.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88572.\n\nBut according to the multiplication, it's 87572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nBut when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572. So, clearly, something's wrong here because both methods should give the same result. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition.\n\nWait, let's compute 29524 *3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 *3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3.\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nAh, so the correct answer is 88572. So, where did I go wrong in the multiplication? Let me check again:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nWait, that gives 87572, but the correct sum is 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me try again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nDigit 1: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nDigit 2: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nDigit 3: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nDigit 4: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nDigit 5: 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\nDigit 6: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so digits are:\n\nFrom right: positions 1 to 5: 4,2,5,9,2.\n\nWait, so when multiplying by 3, we have:\n\nPosition 1: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nPosition 2: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nPosition 3: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nPosition 4: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nPosition 5: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But according to the addition, it's 88572. Wait, this is confusing. There must be a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write 29524 as:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nSo, from right to left: 4 (units), 2 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 9 (thousands), 2 (ten thousands).\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n4*3=12: write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7: write 7.\n\n5*3=15: write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8: write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nBut when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy of 1000. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the addition.\n\nWait, let me add 29524 + 29524 again:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4+4=8\n\n2+2=4\n\n5+5=10, write 0, carry 1.\n\n9+9=18 +1=19, write 9, carry 1.\n\n2+2=4 +1=5.\n\nSo, 59048.\n\nNow, 59048 + 29524:\n\n8+4=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4+2=6 +1=7.\n\n0+5=5.\n\n9+9=18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5+2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88572.\n\nWait, so the addition is correct, but the multiplication is giving a different result. That means I must have made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me try multiplying 29524 by 3 again:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nBut according to the addition, it's 88572. Wait, this is perplexing. There must be an error in my approach. Let me try another method: break down 29524 into parts.\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nMultiply each by 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication method earlier. It seems that when I was multiplying digit by digit, I might have misaligned the digits or made a carry-over error. Therefore, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572, which is different. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a digit or miscalculated one of the steps. Let me try again carefully:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nDigit 1 (units place): 4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nDigit 2 (tens place): 2*3=6 +1 (carry)=7. Write down 7.\n\nDigit 3 (hundreds place): 5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nDigit 4 (thousands place): 9*3=27 +1 (carry)=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nDigit 5 (ten thousands place): 2*3=6 +2 (carry)=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 87572. But according to the addition, it's 88572. So, there's a discrepancy in the thousands place. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing them down. Let me write the multiplication properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n\n    *        3\n\n    ------------\n\n      8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, but according to the addition, it's 88572. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, let me write the multiplication step by step:\n\n- Multiply 4 (units) by 3: 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n- Multiply 2 (tens) by 3: 6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\n- Multiply 5 (hundreds) by 3:15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n- Multiply 9 (thousands) by 3:27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n- Multiply 2 (ten thousands) by 3:6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nBut when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition. Let me try adding 29524 + 29524 + 29524 again.\n\nFirst, add 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 +4=8\n\n2 +2=4\n\n5 +5=10, write 0, carry 1.\n\n9 +9=18 +1=19, write 9, carry 1.\n\n2 +2=4 +1=5.\n\nSo, 59048.\n\nNow, add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 +4=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 +2=6 +1=7.\n\n0 +5=5.\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the addition is correct, which means the multiplication must be wrong. So, why is the digit-by-digit multiplication giving me 87572 instead of 88572?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits when writing the result. Let me write the multiplication again, carefully:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n\n    *        3\n\n    ------------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12: write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7: write 7.\n\n5*3=15: write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8: write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits in order: 8 (from the ten thousands place), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 2 (units). So, 87572.\n\nWait, but the correct sum is 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier layers when computing Layer 9.\n\nWait, let's go back to the earlier steps. Maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me retrace my steps:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nWait, let's check Layer9 again: 1 +3*9841.\n\n3*9841: 9841*3.\n\nCompute 9841*3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2.\n\nSince there are no more digits, write the carry 2.\n\nSo, 9841*3=29523.\n\nThen, Layer9=1 +29523=29524. That's correct.\n\nSo, Layer9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so earlier when I multiplied 29524*3, I thought I got 87572, but actually, it's 88572. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me try again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12: write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7: write 7.\n\n5*3=15: write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8: write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits in order: 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 2 (units). So, 87572.\n\nBut that contradicts the addition result of 88572. Wait, perhaps I'm misaligning the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n\n    *        3\n\n    ------------\n\n          8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, but the correct sum is 88572, which is 88,572. So, perhaps I'm missing a digit or misplacing it.\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 *3 using another method:\n\n29524 *3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3 = 60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12=60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+60=88560+12=88572.\n\nSo, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me try again, carefully:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\n5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. Wait, but this contradicts the correct sum of 88572. I must be making a mistake in the multiplication steps. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the digits.\n\nWait, let me write the multiplication step by step, showing each digit's contribution:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n- Thousands place:9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n- Ten thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the digits are: 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 2 (units). So, 87572.\n\nBut according to the addition, it's 88572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let's go back to the layers. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nSo, Layer9 is 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I might have miscounted the digits or misaligned them, leading to the incorrect 87572. So, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the final result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, that's accurate. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, yes. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me define a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think I've thought this through thoroughly. Each step makes sense, and the recursive approach as well as the closed-form solution back up the iterative computation. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " 3 * 3 = 9, write down 9. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me check that again because 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 would be 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but since a \u2260 1, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{hom} = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant L_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a*K + b \u21d2 K - a*K = b \u21d2 K(1 - a) = b \u21d2 K = b/(1 - a). So, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + K. Applying initial condition: At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*a^1 + K \u21d2 4 = C*3 + K. But K = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. Let me think: The original expression is 3*(L_9). Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods all converge to the same result, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.
