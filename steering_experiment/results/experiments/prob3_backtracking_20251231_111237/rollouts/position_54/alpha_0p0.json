Wait, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it properly. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, but 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29,524 * 3: 30,000 *3 = 90,000. Subtract (30,000 -29,524)=476, so 90,000 - (476*3)=90,000 - 1,428=88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check all my steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 +3=4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13 Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40 Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=121 Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=364 Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093 Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280 Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841 Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572 Correct. So, yeah, I think that's right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 =1 +3=4 L_2=1 +3*L1=1 +3*4=13 L_3=1 +3*L2=1 +3*13=40 And so on. So, in general, L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1} with L_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n -3 L_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous equation is L_n -3 L_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p =1 +3*L_p => L_p -3 L_p=1 => -2 L_p=1 => L_p= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, L9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both methods, I get the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the result of each layer and substitute it into the next. After computing all layers, the final step is to multiply the result by 3. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula for the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

So, the correct multiplication is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check Layer 9 again. Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Yes, that's right.

So, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, then wrapping it all in another 3.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as we computed earlier. This recurrence relation can be solved to find a general formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier to ensure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct)\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 (correct)\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 (correct)\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 (correct)\nYes, it works for the first few layers, so the formula seems valid. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute the result without having to calculate each layer manually, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step, as I did initially, and arrived at the same result. Either way, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524.

Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if that's the case. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a_9. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is a_3=40. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, since the problem has 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer), and starting from the innermost, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the value of each layer can be represented as (3^{n} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers. But in this case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I think I've considered all possible angles and checked my work, so I don't see any mistakes. The final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, indeed, 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with all these layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. And so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. That's much faster and less error-prone than computing each layer manually. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution method is standard: find homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Solving for B gives B=-1/2, so the general solution is A*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3 -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2=9/2 => A=3/2. So, a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. That looks correct. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that's correct. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7. 5 *3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Hmm, but wait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify by another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Okay, that checks out. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to make this easier without computing each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Simplify both sides: Left side: C*3^n + D. Right side: C*3^n + 1 + 3D. Equate coefficients: C*3^n terms cancel out. So D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. So (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a recurrence relation or a closed-form formula, we determine that the final value before multiplying by 3 is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such expressions. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 =1 +3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let's see if we can find a recurrence relation here. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 =4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 =3A -1/2 =4. So, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2. Thus, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. That's pretty cool because it avoids computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming, especially if there are many layers. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step.

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add them digit by digit:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n0 + 5 = 5, write 5, carry 0.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88572. Yep, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I started by computing the innermost parentheses, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer was 1 + 3 times the previous layer. I computed each layer step by step up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is built upon the previous one, and since each step was manageable, it didn't get too overwhelming. I didn't make any calculation errors that I can see, but just to be thorough, let me verify a couple of the layers. Let's check Layer 3: Layer 2 was 13, so 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. All steps check out. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Hmm, but wait, that seems high. Let me verify the multiplication another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048.

Wait, but let me double-check the layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence because each layer is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer individually. Looking at the layers: Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 Layer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1 Layer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1 Layer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1 Layer 5: 364 = 3*121 + 1 Layer 6: 1093 = 3*364 + 1 Layer 7: 3280 = 3*1093 + 1 Layer 8: 9841 = 3*3280 + 1 Layer 9: 29524 = 3*9841 + 1 So, each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_1 = 4, and the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Let's write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n = 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I still arrive at the same answer. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct result. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, except for the added 1 each layer, but since the added 1 gets multiplied by 3 each subsequent layer, it's not a straightforward geometric series. However, the recurrence relation approach worked well here. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation, we determine that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So 90000 - (476 \u00d7 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back a step. When I computed Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. But let me verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous computations.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I just realized something. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)). So the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So up to Layer 9, which is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n \u2265 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, which is a_1 = 4. Then each subsequent layer up to layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking back: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), then each subsequent 1+3(...) is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 appears, each time nested inside another. It seems like there are 9 layers because each time you have a 1+3(...), and the innermost is 1+3. So, the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I labeled layer 1 as the innermost, which is 1+3, then layer 2 is 1+3*(layer 1), etc., up to layer 9, which is the outermost before multiplying by the initial 3.\n\nSo, according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation of layer 9 as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's a geometric series in some way, but the closed-form formula seems more straightforward.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, I find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it works. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4) = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 has only five digits, right? So, let me count:\n\nDigits of 29524: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo when multiplying:\n\n- Units place: 4\u00d73=12. Units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7. Tens digit is 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place:5\u00d73=15. Hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place:9\u00d73=27 +1=28. Thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten thousands place:2\u00d73=6 +2=8. Ten thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nYes, 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, right? So then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So is that the final answer?\n\nWait, but let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Because if I messed up one layer, the subsequent layers will be wrong, leading to the wrong final answer.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo all layers are correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, computing each one wasn't too bad.\n\nWait, another approach: Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe there's a recurrence relation here. Let me think about it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = D, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D.\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD = 1 + 3D \u21d2 -2D = 1 \u21d2 D = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 =59048.\n\n59048 divided by 2 is indeed 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nAlternatively, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524.\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nAdding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

So, 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, writing it together: 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524. Let's add: 59048 + 29524.

Then 1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523.

So, writing it out: 87, 572? Wait, let me compute 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: Let me do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12.

That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 = 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, I think my calculations are correct. But just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, Layer 1 is 4, which is a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches Layer 2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is Layer 3. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which corresponds to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead me to the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. \n\nAfter computing each layer up to the ninth layer, we find that the ninth layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So yes, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just verify that each layer was computed correctly because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake here. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Let me see if that applies here. Here, k is 3, and c is 1. The initial term a_1 is 4 (from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4). Wait, but in our case, the layers start at Layer 1 with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, etc. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, so we're looking for a_9. Let me try to apply the formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if the formula works. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, the outermost layer is Layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer individually. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer. That's more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I only had nine layers, computing each step was manageable. Alternatively, if I had more layers, using the formula would be better to avoid repetitive calculations. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can break it down by computing each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n1.

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I saw the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the way I computed it seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 And so on. So, the general formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{hom} = C*(3)^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{part} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*(3)^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*(3)^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*(3)^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again to confirm. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. 3*3=9, write 9. So, 88572. That's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I computed up to Layer 9, which is correct. Then multiplied by 3, which is the outermost operation. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, which might be more efficient and less error-prone. Let's see. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's see. The recurrence is Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. Wait, no, actually Layer 1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I calculated earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrived at the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have continued calculating each layer step by step, but the formula makes it much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or look for a pattern. I notice that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about it.\n\nIf I define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWe can write the homogeneous solution as a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364.

So, 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but I just noticed that when I computed Layer 9, I wrote 3*9841 as 29523, but let me check that: 9841 * 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, 9841*3 is 29523. Yes, that's correct. Then 29523 +1 = 29524. So, that's correct. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. Hmm, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to error, especially with nine layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula or a recursive relation here. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct. I double-checked each step and even derived a formula to compute the nth layer, which gave me the same result as manually computing each layer. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern where each layer is defined as $a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}$, starting with $a_1 = 4$.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, so that seems correct. But wait, when I was doing it digit by digit, I got 88572 as well, so that must be correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me cross-verify because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miscount. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let's recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it using a different approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can recognize that this is a geometric series or something similar, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence is a bit more complex, but since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), computing each step is feasible. Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as a geometric series. Let me think: If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nCompute a_9: (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis matches the earlier result, so it's a good confirmation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the calculations. Each step was straightforward, just multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's a geometric progression of sorts, where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. Alternatively, I could think of this as a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula for such a sequence. Let's define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive approach and the closed-form formula both give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3. \n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to save time instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... and so on. I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. I think that's solid. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from this recurrence, we compute the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, maybe using a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or solved using recurrence relations. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2713\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2713\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2713\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2713\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2713\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2713\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2713\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2713\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2713\n\nPerfect, so the formula works for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, L_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying using both iterative computation and a formula derived from the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

    "text": " So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but considering the number of layers, it might make sense. Let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct) Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 (Correct) So, all the steps seem to check out. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 also seems correct. Therefore, I think the answer is indeed 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident about this result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost term and working step by step, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 is performed to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
