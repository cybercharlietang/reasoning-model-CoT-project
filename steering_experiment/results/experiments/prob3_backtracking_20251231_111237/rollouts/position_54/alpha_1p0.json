    "text": " Wait, actually, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, starting from the right: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented by a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, we can look for a pattern or find a closed-form formula. Let's see if we can find a pattern by computing the first few terms, which we've already done:\n\nL_1 = 4\nL_2 = 13\nL_3 = 40\nL_4 = 121\nL_5 = 364\nL_6 = 1093\nL_7 = 3280\nL_8 = 9841\nL_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent L_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3*C = 1\n-2*C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nFor n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as we calculated before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form solution and verify it. The final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me check my multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7.

Each layer checks out, so the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using a formula for a geometric series or something? Because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which might form a geometric sequence. Let me explore that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. To solve this, I can try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3*a_p + 1\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1\n\n-2*a_p = 1\n\na_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, this method confirms the previous result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, and it would have taken a bit more time but still led me to the correct answer. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same result.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how geometric series work. The formula I derived earlier is a standard solution for such a recurrence, so that's why it worked.\n\nI guess the key takeaway here is recognizing the pattern and being able to model it with a recurrence relation, which can save a lot of time instead of computing each layer manually. But even if I didn't see that, step-by-step computation works too, although it's more time-consuming.\n\nSo, in summary, by either method, the final result is 88572. I feel confident that this is the correct answer because both methods led me to the same place, and I double-checked each step along the way.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recurrence pattern. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(a_n\\) can be expressed as \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Calculating up to the ninth layer gives \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 +3*(previous layer)). How many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, there's a (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of 1+3... terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C -3C =1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nWait, but let me check this formula with n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that matches the earlier computations. So, using the formula, a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the final multiplication.

Wait, that seems correct. Let me add it up: 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check one more time, perhaps by computing each layer step by step, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. 1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, after double-checking each layer, it seems that my computations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using both methods\u2014direct computation and finding a general formula\u2014I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or maybe a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLet's denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSetting them equal: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1\n\nThen, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Good, so that's consistent.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as calculated before.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a geometric progression, but in this case, since each term is defined in terms of the previous one, the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n\n3. After computing Layer 9, multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n4. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, which also leads to the same result.\n\n5. Verify that both methods give the same answer, which they do.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the inside out. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically calculating each layer and then multiplying the final result by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the final layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 87, then 7, then 5, then 7, then 2. Wait, that seems off. Wait, no, actually, let's write it properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought it was 87,572, but that was a mistake in the placement. Actually, the correct multiplication gives 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is multiplied by 3. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the layers would be:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 terms, computing each step is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be derived. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution can be found as a constant. Let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(...\n\nEach layer adds another 1+3(...). So, let's count the number of \"1+3(\" segments:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3(, there's a 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on until the ninth one, which is 1+3(...))))) So, how many layers? Each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, and the total number of such is 9. So, yes, n=9, so a_9=29524, then 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the closed-form formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, as above.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. Just to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure with repeating 1 + 3*(...).\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost.\n3. Alternatively, model it as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution.\n4. Verify the number of layers to ensure n=9.\n5. Multiply the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n2. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me check 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, but let me double-check each layer because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression because each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. If I have an expression like a + r*(a + r*(a + r*(...))) with n layers, it's similar to a geometric series. In this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the general form is x = 1 + 3x', where x' is the next layer. Wait, but each layer is built upon the previous one, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define x_n as the value of the nth layer. So, x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, x_2 = 1 + 3x_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. x_3 = 1 + 3x_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is x_{n} = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4. Now, solving this recurrence relation might give me a formula to compute x_n without calculating each layer step by step, which could be useful for larger n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving x_n - 3x_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, so it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is x_n - 3x_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say x_p. Plugging into the recurrence: x_p = 1 + 3x_p. Solving for x_p: x_p - 3x_p = 1 => -2x_p = 1 => x_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is x_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition x_1 = 4. So, when n=1, x_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: x_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: x_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: x_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: x_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9: x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, x_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*x_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

Wait, let me check that again because when I compute 29524 * 3, I can also compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, subtract 476 * 3 = 1428, so 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct.

So, I think that's the right answer. It seems like each layer is just tripling the previous result and adding 1, which is a geometric progression of sorts. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. I think I'm done then.

    "text": " Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't match my previous calculation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, writing it down: 87572. Wait, but when I added 59048 + 29524, I got 88572, which is different. There must be a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check 29524 * 3 using another approach. 29524 * 3: Break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So that's 88,572. But when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87,572. Clearly, I must have messed up the digit positions. Let me try the digit-by-digit method again carefully: 29524 * 3: Starting from the rightmost digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- Ten-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n- Since there are no more digits, add the carryover 2 at the end.\n\nSo writing it out: 2 (units), 7 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 7 (thousands), 7 (ten-thousands), and then the carryover 2 at the hundred-thousands place. So that's 87,572. Wait, but that contradicts the other method which gave me 88,572. I must be making a mistake somewhere. Let me check 29524 * 3 using another approach. Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Now, 29524 is 30,000 - 476. So, 29524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - (476 * 3). Compute 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Okay, so that confirms that the correct result is 88,572. So I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Probably, I misaligned the digits or missed a carryover. So, the correct result after multiplying 29524 by 3 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let's go back to how I got Layer 9 as 29,524. Let me verify each layer's computation because if that's wrong, the entire calculation will be off.\n\nStarting over, let me compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nOkay, so that part seems correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then multiplying that by 3 gives us 88,572. So the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Therefore, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3 * 29,524 in another way. Let's break down 29,524 into 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the final answer is indeed 88,572.\n\nI think I've got it right now. So, the problem was a nested expression with multiple layers, each adding 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, I was able to find the value of the innermost expression and work my way outwards. Then, multiplying the final result by 3 gave me the answer. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable. I just need to be careful with each multiplication and addition to avoid mistakes, especially with larger numbers. It's easy to misplace a digit or miscalculate a carryover, so double-checking each step helps ensure accuracy. Overall, methodical step-by-step computation is key to solving such problems without getting overwhelmed.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So that would be the final answer. Wait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572, which conflicts with this. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute each digit step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n- Ten-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 8 (from hundred-thousands), 7 (from ten-thousands), 7 (from thousands), 5 (from hundreds), 7 (from tens), 2 (units). So that's 87572. But when I added 59048 + 29524, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition. Let me add 59048 + 29524 again:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\n5 + 2 = 7.\n\nSo the sum is 88572. So that means 29524 * 3 = 88572, which contradicts the digit-by-digit multiplication which gave me 87572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication method. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when doing the multiplication. Let me write it properly:\n\n   29524\nx      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo writing it down, the result is 87572. But wait, when adding 29524 three times, I get 88572. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo that confirms that 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was incorrect. I must have miscounted the digits. Let me see where I went wrong. When I did the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier, I wrote 87572, but that's incorrect. The correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I broke down the multiplication, I thought:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n- Hundreds: 5*3=15 \u21925, carry1.\n- Thousands: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n- Ten-thousands:9*3=27 \u21927, carry2.\n- Hundred-thousands:2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo that would be 8 (hundred-thousands), 7 (ten-thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units) \u2192 87572. But that's conflicting with the addition method which gives 88572. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits when writing down the result. Let me write the multiplication properly:\n\n   29524\nx      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 8 (from the 2*3 + carry), then 7 (from 9*3), then 7 (from 2*3 + carry), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 + carry), then 2. Wait, but that would be 8 7 7 5 7 2, which is 877572? That can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Wait, 29524 is 5 digits, so 29524 * 3 is 88572, which is 5 digits as well. So I think I made a mistake in the digit alignment when writing the result. Let me try again:\n\nWhen I multiply 29524 by 3:\n\n- 4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n- 5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n- 9*3=27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo writing from top to bottom, the digits are:\n\n- Units: 2\n- Tens:7\n- Hundreds:5\n- Thousands:7\n- Ten-thousands:7\n- Hundred-thousands:8\n\nWait, but 29524 is 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3, the result should be:\n\n- Units: 2\n- Tens:7\n- Hundreds:5\n- Thousands:7\n- Ten-thousands:7\n- Hundred-thousands:8\n\nSo that would be 8 (hundred-thousands), 7 (ten-thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 877572, which is a 6-digit number, but 29524*3 should be 88572, a 5-digit number. So I think I'm misaligning the digits. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit:\n\n- 4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n- 5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n- 9*3=27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 8 (from the 2*3 + carry), then 7 (from 9*3), then 7 (from 2*3 + carry), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 + carry), then 2. Wait, that's 877572, which is 6 digits, but that can't be right because 29524 is 5 digits and 3 is 1 digit, so the product can't have more than 6 digits, but it's possible. Wait, but when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572, which is 5 digits. So there must be a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not accounting for the place values correctly. Let me try again, writing each step carefully:\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n- Ten-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo writing the digits from right to left, we have:\n\n2 (units), 7 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 7 (thousands), 7 (ten-thousands), 8 (hundred-thousands).\n\nSo the number is 877572. But that contradicts the addition method which gave me 88572. This is confusing. Let me check with a calculator to verify.\n\nWait, I don't have a calculator here, but I can compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, add them up step by step:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo that's 88572. Therefore, my initial multiplication method was incorrect, probably because I miscounted the digits. The correct result is 88572.\n\nSo, going back, the problem was to compute 3*(...), where the innermost part was 1+3, and each layer wraps around that. After computing all layers up to Layer 9, which was 29524, and then multiplying by 3, we get 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step computation of the layers, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So that should be the final answer.\n\nBut let me just go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct now. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I just made a mistake in the digit alignment during the multiplication earlier, leading to confusion, but verifying through the addition method and the broken-down multiplication method confirms that 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and then the final multiplication, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error at any point. Let me verify Layer 9 again: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check one more layer, say Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 8: 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, each layer seems to compute correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm going to think again about the structure of the problem. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer.\n\nLet me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe a geometric series or something like that.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, we compute the final value as 88572.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested form with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

But I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate somewhere. Let me try computing a few layers again to confirm.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Let's denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have directly calculated a_9 using this formula.\n\nNow, the original problem is to compute 3*a_9, which is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144, then divide by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572. So that's another way to look at it.\n\nThis confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the exponent calculations. 3^10 is 59049, right? Because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So 3^10=59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. All checks out.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. It was a bit time-consuming, but breaking it down step by step and verifying with a formula helped a lot. I was worried about making an arithmetic error with such large numbers, but using the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula made it manageable.\n\nAnother thing I could have done is to compute each layer step by step, but using the formula is more efficient and reduces the chance of error. It's good to know that both methods lead to the same result. I guess practice makes perfect, and being able to recognize patterns and apply formulas is a valuable skill in math problems like this.\n\nI also thought about whether there's a geometric series involved here. Since each term is multiplied by 3, it's similar to a geometric progression, but the addition of 1 each time makes it a bit different. However, the recurrence relation approach worked well, so maybe that's the way to go for similar problems in the future.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the pattern, setting up a recurrence relation, solving it, and then applying it to find the required term, I arrived at the solution. It was a bit tricky at first, but breaking it down made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, it's actually a recurrence relation. Maybe there's a formula for that. Let me think about it. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches what I had before. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, that's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which also matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost before multiplying by 3. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9 in our formula. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just check one more time to be thorough. If I compute Layer 1 to Layer 9 as before, each step: Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, times 3 is 88572. So, both methods confirm the same result. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4.

The final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2.

Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2; carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, 7; carry 0. 5*3=15, 5; carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, 8; carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. So, the final answer would be 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems quite a large number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, up to Layer 9, it's 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to compute it without expanding each layer, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers: For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct. So, I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the computation. Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure I didn't miscalculate any of them.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems consistent each time. So, maybe my initial calculation was correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented by a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but maybe for this problem, since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 1 + 3*L_p\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nWait, that seems odd because our layers are all positive integers. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the particular solution. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can write the recurrence as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is similar to the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * (L_0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but L_1 is 4, not L_0. Let me adjust the indices.\n\nLet me consider n starting from 1. Then, L_1 = 4, and L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 for n >= 2.\n\nThe general formula for such a recurrence is L_n = (L_1 - c) * a^{n-1} + c, where c is the particular solution. Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the sum.\n\nAlternatively, I can unroll the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1\n= 3*(3*L_{n-2} + 1) + 1\n= 3^2*L_{n-2} + 3 + 1\n= 3^2*(3*L_{n-3} + 1) + 3 + 1\n= 3^3*L_{n-3} + 3^2 + 3 + 1\n...\nContinuing this way, after n-1 steps, we get:\nL_n = 3^{n-1}*L_1 + 3^{n-2} + 3^{n-3} + ... + 3 + 1\n\nSince L_1 = 4, this becomes:\nL_n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1)\n= 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nSimplify:\n= (8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n= (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n= (3^{2}*3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n= (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that algebra again.\n\nStarting from L_n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n\nFactor 3^{n-1}:\n\n= 3^{n-1}*(4 + 1/2) - 1/2\n= 3^{n-1}*(9/2) - 1/2\n= (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n= (3^2 * 3^{n-1} - 1)/2\n= (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13.

Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Because sometimes when I'm dealing with indices, it's easy to shift them incorrectly.\n\nGiven that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and n goes from 1 to 9, then L_9 is indeed (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, as I found earlier.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I've got it right. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or a formula.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so perhaps it's a form of a recursively defined sequence.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step seems to check out, and the closed-form formula gives the same result as the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the inner layer into the next outer one. Using a recursive approach and verifying with a closed-form formula, we find the result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer), starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute each layer sequentially**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.

Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524*3 again. 29524 *3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to compute 29524*3 is to break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the expression has nine layers, each time adding 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me confirm that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nWait, actually, each layer adds another \"1+3(\", so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(...), and there are 9 such layers because each opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a layer.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 1 as 1+3, that's the innermost. Then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer 9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, 9 layers, each time 1 + 3*(previous). So, I think my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without expanding each layer, which might be more efficient. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >1.\n\nSo, L_2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nL3=1 +3*L2=1+39=40\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} =0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)}= A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)}=C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized this pattern as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... +3^{n} for n layers. But wait, let me think about that.\n\nWait, actually, when I expand the expression, each layer adds a term multiplied by 3^k. Let me try expanding it.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1=1+3=4=1+3^1\n\nLayer2=1+3*(1+3)=1+3+9=13=1+3+3^2\n\nLayer3=1+3*(1+3+9)=1+3+9+27=40=1+3+3^2+3^3\n\nWait, so each layer adds another power of 3. So, Layer n=1+3+3^2+...+3^{n}\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, Layer1=4=1+3=1+3^1\n\nLayer2=13=1+3+9=1+3^1+3^2\n\nLayer3=40=1+3+9+27=1+3^1+3^2+3^3\n\nSo, Layer n= sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but starting from k=0? Wait, 1 is 3^0, so yes.\n\nWait, but in the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, when expanded, each layer adds another term of 3^{n}.\n\nSo, for Layer n, it's equal to sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nBut wait, the sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1}-1)/(r-1).\n\nHere, r=3, so sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nWhich is exactly what I got earlier with the recurrence relation.\n\nSo, for Layer9, it's sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I had more time, I could write a small program or use a calculator to compute each layer step by step to verify, but since I've done it manually twice and both times arrived at the same result, I feel confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and using the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value efficiently without having to calculate each layer manually beyond a certain point. This approach saved time and reduced the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively multiplying the previous total by 3 and then adding 1. So, starting from 4, each layer is 3*previous +1, which is exactly the recurrence relation I used earlier.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each step and verifying through multiple methods, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 would be 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that because if that's correct, then the final answer would be 88572. Let me retrace my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly, so Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that the expression is correctly interpreted. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, yes, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after nine layers, we get 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. This kind of expression is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can model it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be written as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have nine layers, n=9 for the innermost, but wait, actually, let's check. The innermost is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. Then each subsequent layer increases n by 1. So, the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, after verifying both by step-by-step computation and by solving the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which confirms our step-by-step computation. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nI recall that expressions like this, where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(...), can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let's see if that's applicable here.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4.\n\nWe can also find another equation by considering the recurrence relation. Since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, substituting the general solution:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^{n} + B\n\nRight side: A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSubtract 3B:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, plug B back into the initial condition equation:\n\n3A + (-1/2) = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5.

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct).

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here to compute this more efficiently without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L1. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572 Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's correct, as before. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L9, and L9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, the total expression is (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That confirms the answer again. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, which might save time if I have to compute many layers. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, as I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Wait, that's different from my previous result. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, did I do something wrong here? Let me check. The entire expression is 3*(a_9). Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. But earlier, when I computed 3*29524, I got 87572. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, correct. So, 177147 -3 =177144. 177144/2=88572. But when I did 3*29524, I got 87572. So, which one is correct? Let me compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 87572. Hmm, but according to the formula, it should be 88572. There's a 1000 difference here. That suggests that either my formula is wrong or my initial computation is wrong. Wait, let's see. The formula says that the entire expression is 3*a_9 = (3^{11}-3)/2. But when I computed a_9 as 29524, then 3*29524=87572, which is not equal to 88572. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the formula. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9, where a_9 is defined as 1 + 3*a_8. But according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. So that's correct. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524=87572. But according to the formula, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, which one is correct? There's a discrepancy of 1000. Hmm, perhaps my formula is incorrect. Let me re-derive the recurrence relation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Wait, earlier I assumed a particular solution as a constant, which gave me B=-1/2. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Then, applying a_1=4: 4 = A*3 -1/2 => A= (4 +1/2)/3 = (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2 -1/2). So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}/2 -1/2)= (59049/2 -1/2)= (59048)/2=29524. Correct. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=87572. So, why does the formula (3^{11}-3)/2 give 88572? That suggests that perhaps the formula is not correctly applied. Wait, perhaps the formula is for the entire expression, not just a_n. Let me think.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*a_9. If I let E = 3*a_9, then E = 3*a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*a_8) = 3 + 9*a_8. Similarly, E can be expressed as 3 + 9*a_8. But a_8 =1 + 3*a_7, so E=3 + 9*(1 + 3*a_7)=3 +9 +27*a_7=12 +27*a_7. Continuing this way, E=12 +27*a_7=12 +27*(1 +3*a_6)=12 +27 +81*a_6=39 +81*a_6. It seems that each time I expand, the coefficients are powers of 3. So, after expanding all the way, E would be 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^9 + 3^{10}*(1). Wait, that's a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nE = 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^9 + 3^{10}*1.\n\nWait, because each layer adds another factor of 3. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 1 +3, and each time we go out, we multiply by 3 and add 1. So, when we expand the entire expression, it's like:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3))...))\n\nExpanding this, each 1 contributes a term multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers it's nested. So, starting from the innermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^8, then the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1. Plus, the 3s from each multiplication step.\n\nWait, perhaps E can be expressed as the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, multiplied by 3, plus the sum of 3^{k+1} from k=0 to 8? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think differently. Each time we have a 1 inside, it gets multiplied by 3 each time it goes up a layer. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, etc., up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0. Similarly, each 3 in the expression is also contributing, but perhaps it's better to model it as a geometric series.\n\nWait, actually, let me consider that E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) and so on. Let me denote the entire inner expression as E itself. Wait, but that's not quite right because E is defined as the entire expression, which is 3 times something. Let me try to express E in terms of itself.\n\nWait, no, because each layer is similar but not identical. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me try to compute E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3))...)) with nine layers. Each layer adds a 1 and a 3 multiplied by the next layer. So, when expanded, E would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)))).\n\nIf I expand this, it would be:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... + 3*3*3*...*3*1\n\nWhere the number of 3s in each term increases by one each time, up to nine 3s. Wait, no, actually, since there are nine layers, the innermost term is just 1 +3, so when you expand the entire expression, the number of terms would be equal to the number of layers, which is nine. Wait, maybe not. Let me try a smaller example to see the pattern.\n\nSuppose I have E = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 +3=4.\n\nNext layer: 1 +3*4=13.\n\nOutermost: 3*13=39.\n\nAlternatively, expanding E:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3)) = 3*(1 +3*(4))=3*(1+12)=3*13=39.\n\nNow, if I expand this without layers:\n\nE =3*1 +3*3*1 +3*3*3*1. Wait, that's 3 +9 +27=39. Yes, that's correct. So, E = 3 +9 +27=39.\n\nSimilarly, for two layers: E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*13=39, which is 3 +9 +27=39.\n\nWait, so in general, for n layers, E=3 +9 +27 +...+3^{n}. Wait, but in the case of two layers, n=2: 3 +9=12, but E=39. Wait, no, that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, in the two-layer example, E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3)). So, the innermost is 1 +3=4, then 1 +3*4=13, then 3*13=39. So, when expanded, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39. If I expand it fully, it's 3*1 +3*3*1 +3*3*3*1. So, three terms: 3, 9, 27, totaling 39. So, for two layers, we have three terms: 3^1, 3^2, 3^3. Hmm, so perhaps for n layers, the expansion has n+1 terms, from 3^1 to 3^{n+1}.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, we have nine layers. So, expanding E would give us 10 terms: 3^1 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^{10}. Let's check that.\n\nWait, in the two-layer example, n=2, we have three terms: 3^1 +3^2 +3^3=3+9+27=39, which matches. So, for nine layers, E=3 +9 +27 +...+3^{10}. Therefore, E is the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^n -1)/(r-1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nHere, a=3, r=3, n=10. So, S=3*(3^{10} -1)/(3-1)=3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I got E=87572. So, there's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, in the two-layer example, using the formula: sum from k=1 to 3 of 3^k=3+9+27=39, which matches the step-by-step computation. So, the formula works there. Therefore, for nine layers, the sum should be from k=1 to 10 of 3^k=88572. But when I computed step by step, I got 87572. So, that suggests that my step-by-step computation was wrong.\n\nWait, let me check my step-by-step computation again. Earlier, I computed layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 87572. But according to the formula, it should be 88572. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me re-examine the layers.\n\nWait, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, E=3*a_9=3*29524=87572. But according to the geometric series, E= sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k= (3^{11} -3)/2=88572. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute both 3*a_9 and the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k.\n\nCompute 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nBut when I computed a_9=29524, then 3*29524=87572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation of a_9. Let me recompute the layers again.\n\nLayer 1:1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nSo, a_9=29524. Therefore, E=3*29524=87572.\n\nBut according to the geometric series, E= sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k=88572.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 is correct for a_n, but E=3*a_n, which would be 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, E=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nBut when I compute step by step, I get E=87572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the step-by-step computation. Let me check where.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of layers again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to nine layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed a_9=29524, that was for nine layers, and then E=3*a_9=87572. However, according to the geometric series, E should be sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k=88572. Therefore, perhaps the step-by-step approach is missing a term.\n\nWait, let's see. When I computed E step by step, I ended up with 3*a_9=87572, but according to the geometric series, it should be 88572. The difference is 1000. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the step-by-step approach. Let me try to compute E as the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k and see what that gives.\n\nCompute 3 +9 +27 +81 +243 +729 +2187 +6561 +19683 +59049.\n\nLet me add them up step by step:\n\nStart with 3.\n\n3 +9=12.\n\n12 +27=39.\n\n39 +81=120.\n\n120 +243=363.\n\n363 +729=1092.\n\n1092 +2187=3279.\n\n3279 +6561=9840.\n\n9840 +19683=29523.\n\n29523 +59049=88572.\n\nYes, that adds up to 88572. So, the correct answer should be 88572. Therefore, my earlier step-by-step computation was wrong because I thought E=3*a_9, but actually, E is the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k, which is 88572.\n\nBut wait, according to the recurrence relation, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, E=3*a_9=3*29524=87572. But that contradicts the geometric series sum which is 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I have a misunderstanding in defining E. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the step-by-step approach, I computed a_9=29524, which is the value of the innermost expression after nine layers: 1 +3*(1 +3*(...)) nine times. Then, E=3*a_9=87572.\n\nBut according to the expansion, E is the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k=88572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute both approaches with a smaller number of layers to see which is correct.\n\nTake n=1: E=3*(1+3)=3*4=12.\n\nAccording to the geometric series, sum from k=1 to 2 of 3^k=3+9=12. Correct.\n\nAccording to the recurrence, a_1=4, E=3*a_1=12. Correct.\n\nn=2: E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*13=39.\n\nGeometric series: sum from k=1 to 3 of 3^k=3+9+27=39. Correct.\n\nRecurrence: a_2=13, E=3*13=39. Correct.\n\nn=3: E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*13)=3*40=120.\n\nGeometric series: sum from k=1 to 4 of 3^k=3+9+27+81=120. Correct.\n\nRecurrence: a_3=40, E=3*40=120. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the case of n=3, the geometric series sum is 3+9+27+81=120, which is four terms. So, for n layers, the geometric series has n+1 terms, from 3^1 to 3^{n+1}.\n\nBut in the recurrence approach, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, and E=3*a_n=(3^{n+2}-3)/2.\n\nWait, for n=1: E=3*a_1=3*4=12. (3^{3}-3)/2=(27-3)/2=24/2=12. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: E=3*a_2=3*13=39. (3^4 -3)/2=(81-3)/2=78/2=39. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: E=3*a_3=3*40=120. (3^5 -3)/2=(243-3)/2=240/2=120. Correct.\n\nSo, for n=9, E=(3^{11} -3)/2=(177147-3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572, not 87572. So, where did I go wrong in my step-by-step computation earlier?\n\nAh, I see now. When I computed a_9=29524, that was for the innermost expression after nine layers, which is 1 +3*(...). But the entire expression is 3*(1 +3*(...)), which is 3*a_9. However, according to the geometric series, the entire expression E is equal to (3^{11} -3)/2=88572, which is consistent with the recurrence formula.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step computation, I computed E=3*a_9=3*29524=87572, which is different. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation in the step-by-step approach. Let me check the layers again.\n\nWait, no, the step-by-step computation of the layers was correct. a_9=29524. Then, E=3*a_9=87572. But according to the geometric series, it's 88572. Therefore, there's a contradiction. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the step-by-step approach is missing something. Let me think about it. When I compute E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with nine layers, it's equivalent to E=3 +9 +27 +...+3^{10}=88572.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step approach, E=3*a_9=87572. Therefore, the step-by-step approach must be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the definition of a_n is different.\n\nWait, in the step-by-step approach, a_1=4=1+3.\n\na_2=1 +3*a_1=1+12=13.\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=1+39=40.\n\n...\n\na_9=1 +3*a_8=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*a_9=87572.\n\nBut according to the geometric series, E= sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k=88572.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the step-by-step approach is wrong because it doesn't account for all the terms. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the step-by-step approach, E=3*a_9=3*(1 +3*a_8)=3 +9*a_8.\n\nBut according to the geometric series, E=3 +9 +27 +...+3^{10}.\n\nSo, in the step-by-step approach, when I compute E=3*a_9, I'm only accounting for the 3*1 +3*3*1 +... up to 3*3^9*1, which is 3 +9 +27 +...+3^{10}. Wait, no, that's exactly what the geometric series is. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, no, in the step-by-step approach, E=3*a_9=3*(1 +3*a_8)=3 +9*a_8. But a_8=1 +3*a_7=1 +3*(1 +3*a_6)=1 +3 +9*a_6. Therefore, E=3 +9*(1 +3*a_7)=3 +9 +27*a_7. Continuing this way, E=3 +9 +27 +81*a_7. So, each time, we're adding another term of 3^k.\n\nTherefore, after expanding all layers, E=3 +9 +27 +81 +...+3^{10}= sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k=88572.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step computation, E=3*a_9=87572. Therefore, the step-by-step computation must be wrong because it's missing some terms.\n\nWait, no, in the step-by-step approach, a_9=29524, which includes all the inner terms. Then, E=3*a_9=3*29524=87572. But according to the expansion, E=88572. Therefore, the step-by-step approach is wrong. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2 is incorrect. Let me re-derive it.\n\nGiven a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, assume a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K -3*K=1 => -2K=1 => K=-1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n= C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4= C*3 -1/2 => C*3=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3=3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2 -1/2)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*a_9=3*29524=87572.\n\nBut according to the geometric series, E= sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k=88572.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute both 3*a_9 and the geometric series sum.\n\nCompute 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as the geometric series sum. So, why did I get 87572 earlier?\n\nAh, I see now. Earlier, I mistakenly thought that 3*a_9=87572, but actually, 3*a_9= (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nSo, my earlier mistake was in the multiplication. Let me recompute 3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. I must have made a mistake in the earlier multiplication. So, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- The expression is a nested multiplication with nine layers.\n\n- Each layer can be computed using the recurrence relation a_n"

Let me check my multiplication again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524, right? So 3 times that is 88572. But wait, let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the problem, I thought the answer might be 88572, but I want to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a calculation error.\n\nLet me try another approach: maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nI can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4\n\nWe can find another equation by computing a_2:\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nUsing the general solution for a_2:\n\n13 = A*3^2 + B => 9A + B = 13\n\nNow we have a system of equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5\n\nNow plug A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the 9th layer, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Because sometimes when you derive a formula, you might have an off-by-one error.\n\nWait, the formula I derived was a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n starts at 1 for the innermost layer. So for layer 1, n=1, a_1=4, which is correct.\n\nSo, for layer 9, n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, correct.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, especially with multiplication outside, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me check again how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is the start of a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+\" terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, actually, each time I see a \"1+\", that's a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first 3(...), inside it is 1 + 3(...). Then inside that is another 1 + 3(...), and so on, until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(...), that's layer 9 (outermost). Each inner layer is one less. So, the innermost is layer 1, which is 1+3. Then each layer wraps around that.\n\nWait, so if I have nine layers, then the formula a_9 would be the outermost layer, and then the entire expression is 3 times a_9.\n\nWait, no, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result of the innermost 1+3(...). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed a_9 as 29524, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has how many 1+3 terms? Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen 1+3(...)\n\nEach time, so:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9:1+3(Layer8)\n\nThus, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with a different approach, maybe using a loop or iterative method.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent each layer as a function. Let me define f(n) as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, f(1)=1+3=4\n\nf(2)=1+3*f(1)=1+12=13\n\nf(3)=1+3*f(2)=1+39=40\n\nf(4)=1+3*f(3)=1+120=121\n\nf(5)=1+3*f(4)=1+363=364\n\nf(6)=1+3*f(5)=1+1092=1093\n\nf(7)=1+3*f(6)=1+3279=3280\n\nf(8)=1+3*f(7)=1+9840=9841\n\nf(9)=1+3*f(8)=1+29523=29524\n\nSo, f(9)=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculations.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand it all the way, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This is similar to the expansion of (3)^n, but with additions of 1 at each level.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to stick with the recursive formula I have, which gives me a closed-form solution.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that each time you have 1 + 3*(something), which can be written as 1 + 3x, where x is the inner expression. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is built upon the previous.\n\nWait, but I think I've verified it enough times. Each step seems correct, and the formula using the closed-form solution gives me the same result as computing each layer step by step. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we get 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after all these checks, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula confirms that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it out: 2 9 5 2 4 * 3. Starting from the units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute one or two layers again to check. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364=1092, plus 1=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093=3279, plus 1=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280=9840, plus 1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841=29523, plus 1=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time if the expression were longer. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 =4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard method to solve it is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result. Using the formula is much faster, especially if the number of layers increases. It's always good to look for patterns and possible formulas when dealing with nested expressions like this. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the 9th layer, this gives \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3, the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me verify that because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me confirm each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. Let's see if that helps. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 1, each time you go out a layer, you're doing (previous result * 3 + 1). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: (4 * 3) + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (13 * 3) + 1 = 40\n\nAnd so on, which is exactly what I did before.\n\nSo, after computing all layers up to Layer 9, which gives 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let's see if there's a pattern or a recurrence relation here.\n\nEach a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K =1 +3*K \u21d2 K -3K=1 \u21d2 -2K=1 \u21d2 K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4=3C -1/2 \u21d2 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising.

So, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThen, (59049 -1)=59048\n\nDivide by 2: 59048/2=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, since each a_n follows a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2= (3^{n+2}-3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, which confirms the result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, it's 8 8 7 5 2. Wait, no, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be more than 80,000. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the placement. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units place: 2, carryover 1\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place: 7, carryover 0\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place: 5, carryover 1\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place: 8, carryover 2\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten-thousands place: 8\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that seems more reasonable. Let me check: 29,524 \u00d7 3. 29,524 \u00d7 3: 20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000; 9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000; 500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500; 20 \u00d7 3 = 60; 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. So adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier.
