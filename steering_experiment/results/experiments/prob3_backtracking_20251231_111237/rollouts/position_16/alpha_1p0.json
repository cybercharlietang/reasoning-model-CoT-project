    "text": " Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think of each innermost expression as a starting point. So, starting from the very inside, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define each layer from the innermost to the outermost as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, L1 is the innermost: L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 is the next layer out: L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd this pattern continues up to L9. So, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, if I can compute L1 through L9, then multiplying the outermost 3 by L9 will give me the result.\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot it. L2 is 13.\n\nMoving on to L3:\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL3 is 40.\n\nNext, L4:\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL4 is 121.\n\nNow, L5:\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL5 is 364.\n\nProceeding to L6:\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL6 is 1093.\n\nNext, L7:\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL7 is 3280.\n\nMoving on to L8:\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL8 is 9841.\n\nFinally, L9:\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, L9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nFirst, compute 3 * 29000 = 87000\n\nThen, 3 * 524 = 1572\n\nAdding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. It's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, to ensure I didn't make a mistake, maybe I can compute each layer again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the closed-form formula works. Therefore, for the nth layer, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result. So, using the closed-form formula, we can compute the result without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually was manageable, but for more layers, the formula would be more efficient.\n\nSo, in summary, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we arrive at the final result of 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\). Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the outermost 3 by \\( L_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot L_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, perhaps I should consider each step as a separate computation. Let's define each step as S1, S2, S3, up to S9, where each S corresponds to each set of parentheses, starting from the innermost. So, S1 would be the innermost parentheses, and S9 would be the outermost. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with S1: S1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, S3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit off.

It's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers.\n\nLet me go through each step again more carefully.\n\nStarting with S1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9, which is 3*29524.

Let me check again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nStarting from the left, after the first 3, we have (1+3(...)). Each time, there's a new (1+3(...)). Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost is 1+3.\n\nSo, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each layer wraps another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, each S1 to S9 corresponds to each layer. So, in my initial calculation, I had S1 as the innermost, which is correct.\n\nSo, S1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. Because sometimes when you have multiple parentheses, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach. Let me write the expression as a series of nested functions:\n\nLet me define f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, the expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think. The function f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nf(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nThe homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution f_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me check with n=1: f(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nn=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2\n\nTherefore, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value until reaching the outermost layer. Then, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - S1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   - S3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   - S4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   - S5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   - S6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   - S7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   - S8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   - S9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Total = 3 * S9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe it's better to work from the inside out, computing each innermost expression first. Let me try that approach. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(result from the previous layer). So, if the innermost was 4, the next layer would be 1 + 3*4.

So, 3*13 = 39, and then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so that layer is 40. Let me write these down as I go to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so starting from the innermost as layer 1, we should have nine layers to compute. Let me recount:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. Now, after computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 29524. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's break it down to make it easier. 29524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88,572? Let me check that again using another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Sometimes when I'm doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a step.\n\nLet me verify each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the layers check out. So, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572. Therefore, the solution should be 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value at the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For each subsequent layer, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it.\n\nWe have a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Since the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. That matches our earlier calculation for layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, this method confirms our previous result. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have a closed-form solution, we can use that to find a_9 directly without computing each layer. But in this case, since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step by step was manageable, but for larger numbers, the closed-form would be more efficient.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, yes, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a closed-form solution using recurrence relations, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)}\\).\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is \\(3 \\times 29524\\). \n\nCalculating this:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me try again. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? So that's the first part to compute. Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another expression: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the second layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, the third layer is 40. Hmm, this seems like it's increasing each time. Let me see if there's a pattern here. So far, I have:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\n\nWait, let me check that again because 1 + 3*13 is 1 + 39 = 40, yes. Now, moving out another layer, Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nNow, Layer 5 would be 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nNext, Layer 6 would be 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nMoving on to Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute that: 3*1093. Hmm, 1093*3. Let me do that step by step: 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nNow, Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280 first. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nNow, after computing all the layers from the innermost to the outermost, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9's result, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n9000*3 = 27000\n500*3 = 1500\n20*3 = 60\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093 again: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I did it step by step earlier, I also got 88572, so that's consistent.\n\nHmm, maybe I can look for a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain progression. Let me list out the layers again with their values:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term is following the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for it. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a geometric sequence. The solution can be written as a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where B is a constant. Let me find A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression after 9 layers is a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} -3 =177147 -3=177144.\n\nThen, 177144 / 2 =88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression, which gives the same result:88572.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outward.

Maybe I should do it more carefully.\n\n29524\n*     3\n= ?\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E9. Let me go back through each E step by step.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\nE7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\nE8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\nE9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo E9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine 1+3(...) terms, right? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time I added a layer. So E1 to E9, each being 1 + 3*(previous E). So, yes, nine layers. So the computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe general form is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is E_n = a^{n} * C + d, where d is the particular solution.\n\nTo find d, set E_n = d, so d = 3d + 1 => d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2.\n\nThen the homogeneous solution is E_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}.\n\nSo the general solution is E_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition E1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for E9, n=9:\n\nE9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So E9=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way without using the formula. Let me compute each E again, just to cross-verify.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, same results. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each term step by step without using E notation. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely thorough, maybe I can compute each multiplication step by step, without relying on the previous E values.\n\nLet me write out the entire expression step by step, expanding each layer:\n\nStart with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. I think I've checked this enough ways. The answer is 88572.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've gone through this problem thoroughly. Each step checks out, and the computations are consistent. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Wait, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work outward. Let me try that. Let's start by computing the innermost expression first. The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? So, that would be 1 + 3 = 4. Let me note that down. So, innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, second layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. Third layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, then 1 + 120 is 121. Fourth layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 121. Continuing outward: next layer is 1 + 3*(121). So, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Fifth layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 364. Next, 1 + 3*(364). Let's calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Sixth layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093. Moving outward again: 1 + 3*(1093). Calculating that: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Seventh layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute this: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Eighth layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Ninth layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3 times the entire expression. So, after computing the innermost expression and working outward, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then, the problem is 3 multiplied by this value. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let me do the multiplication step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So, putting it all together, 29524*3 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Next, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Next, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Finally, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the number of layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, that's nine layers, and the final result inside the parentheses is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, is there a formula for a_n in such a recursive sequence? The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the expression inside the parentheses is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this without expanding each layer by using the formula. Since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is computed by taking 1 plus 3 times the previous result.\n3. After computing all layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524.\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute each innermost part step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that innermost result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the second layer is 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, the third layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Fourth layer is 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Fifth layer is 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Sixth layer is 1093.\n\nContinuing: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Seventh layer is 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Eighth layer is 9841.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute that: 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Ninth layer is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think I have nine layers in total, each building on the previous one. Let me recount each step to make sure I didn't skip any or make a calculation error.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so after computing each layer step by step, the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4, and each subsequent layer builds up, ending with the ninth layer being 29524. But wait, the original problem is 3 times that entire expression, right? Let me check the original problem again: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers. So, the entire expression inside the outermost 3 is the ninth layer, which is 29524. Therefore, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me verify using another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me double-check how many layers there are. The original problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, that's one layer. Each time we go out, we add another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1 + 3. Let me write it out:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, my initial calculation was correct with nine layers, ending at 29524, and then multiplying by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm once again by recalculating each layer step by step, just to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's consistent. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm feeling uncertain because 88572 seems like a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this nested expression, which might allow me to compute it without expanding each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, this recursive sequence can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since n is small (only 9 layers), computing each term step by step is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, we can recognize that each a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, let's see: For a_1 = 4, which is (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Hmm, that's correct.\n\na_2 = 13, which would be (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3 = 40 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\na_4 = 121 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\na_5 = 364 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\na_6 = 1093 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\na_7 = 3280 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\na_8 = 9841 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\na_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, indeed, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nThis formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation, so I'm even more confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the general case. Suppose we have an expression of the form E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... + 3(1 + 3)...))), with n layers. Then, as we've seen, each layer a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, the outermost expression would be 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nIn our problem, n = 9 layers, so substituting, we get (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's exactly the same result as before. This further confirms that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^11 manually:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^11 is 177147, subtract 3 gives 177144, divide by 2 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, using the general formula, we arrive at the same answer, which solidifies that 88572 is indeed the correct result.\n\nIn summary, by carefully computing each nested layer step by step and then verifying using a general formula for such expressions, I've arrived at the conclusion that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds up as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcomplicating it, but perhaps if I define each layer, I can compute each step. Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution or recognize a pattern. Let me try computing from the inside out, step by step. Let's start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(result from innermost). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So perhaps each layer is built upon the next. Let me try to structure this. Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define each layer starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- Up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) so the outermost is 3 times (something). So maybe the total number of layers is 9, but each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So perhaps I should compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost, then multiply the outermost by 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So each of those is a layer. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then the next one is (1 + 3*(innermost)), and so on, up to nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3 times the ninth layer. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from Layer 1 as 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the prior. So, after computing up to Layer 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, maybe I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a layer. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) parts. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then each step out adds another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n2. (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*(13)) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*(40)) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*(121)) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*(364)) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*(1093)) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*(3280)) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*(9841)) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, that's nine layers, each step computing the next layer out. Then, the entire expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which is 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12, carryover 1, digit 2\n\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 +1 =7, carryover 0, digit 7\n\n3 \u00d7 5 =15, carryover 1, digit 5\n\n3 \u00d7 2 =6 +1=7, carryover 0, digit 7\n\n3 \u00d7 9=27, carryover 2, digit 7\n\n3 \u00d7 2=6 +2=8, digit 8\n\nSo the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me confirm:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12, so 2 and carryover 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 +1=7.\n\n3 \u00d7 5=15, so 5 and carryover 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 2=6 +1=7.\n\n3 \u00d7 9=27, so 7 and carryover 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 2=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3 = (30,000 - 476) \u00d73 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total value is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly. Because sometimes when I'm doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, that seems to check out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. So, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same result without computing each layer step by step. That's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my initial step-by-step calculation, let me verify one more time:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) directly, but since it's nine layers deep, it's more efficient to compute each layer step by step.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous step:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2} & : 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3} & : 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4} & : 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5} & : 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6} & : 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7} & : 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8} & : 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9} & : 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, maybe it's better to think of each step as a separate computation. Let me try that. Let's define each step as a function where each step is 1 + 3 times the previous step. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first step. Then each subsequent step wraps another 1 + 3 around it. So, if I denote each step as S1, S2, S3, up to S9, then S1 = 1 + 3. S2 = 1 + 3*S1. S3 = 1 + 3*S2, and so on until S9. Then, the entire expression is 3*S9. Hmm, that might be a more systematic way to approach it. Let me try to compute each step one by one. Starting with S1: S1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on. S3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, getting bigger. S4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, this is growing quickly. Let's keep going. S5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. S6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. S7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. S8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. S9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*S9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. Finally, 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,7,8,7. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try another way. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n5*3=15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n9*3=27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17. Write down 7, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: digits are 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, no, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4*3=12. Units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n\nTens place: 2*3=6 +1=7. Tens digit is 7, no carryover.\n\nHundreds place: 5*3=15. Hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n\nThousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28. Thousands digit is 8, carryover 2.\n\nTen thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8. Ten thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that makes sense because 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nLet me verify with another method: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing S9. Let me retrace each step.\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nS2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check S9 again because sometimes it's easy to miscount the steps. The original expression has nine layers of (1 + 3(...)), right? So, starting from the innermost, which is the first (1 + 3), that's S1. Then each subsequent layer adds another S. So, if I have nine layers, then S9 is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*S9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, yes, S9 would be the innermost, and then each layer wraps around, so when I compute 3*S9, that's the entire expression.\n\nWait, but when I computed S1 to S9, each S is (1 + 3*previous S). So, S1 is 4, S2 is 13, up to S9 being 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the S steps.\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nS2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nS3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nS4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nS5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nS6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nS7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nS8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nS9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute S9 another way. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nEach S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1). So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is S(n) = (3^(n) - 1)/2. Let me check that.\n\nWait, let's see: For n=1, S1=4. Plugging into the formula: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2=1. That's not 4. Hmm, maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a different formula. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nWe have S(n) = 1 + 3*S(n-1), with S(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is S(n) = 3*S(n-1), which has the solution S(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say S_p.\n\nPlugging into the equation: S_p = 1 + 3*S_p => S_p = 1 + 3*S_p => 0 = 1 + 2*S_p => S_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is S(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition S(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, S(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, S(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, S9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*S9=3*29524=88572.\n\nLet me just confirm once more using the formula.\n\nSince S(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then 3*S(n) = 3*(3^(n+1) -1)/2 = (3^(n+2) -3)/2.\n\nBut in our case, n=9, so 3*S9 = (3^(11) -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it step by step, used a recurrence relation approach, and even applied a formula to verify. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a formula, we determine that the final result after multiplying the outermost layer by 3 is 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, and then building outward. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer and compute it:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit big. Let me check that again. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay, that's correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems right.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Got it.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3 times 1093: Let me compute that again. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3 times 3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Plus 1 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3 times 9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then plus 1 is 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine layers, right? Let me check how many layers I've computed. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's nine layers. So, the outermost layer would be Layer 9, which is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3 times that Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3 times Layer 9.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it properly.\n\n29524\ntimes      3\n---------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6, plus carryover 1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27, plus carryover 1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6, plus carryover 2=8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 20000=79048\n\n79048 + 9000=88048\n\n88048 + 500=88548\n\n88548 + 24=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier steps. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when multiplying by 3 multiple times.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, all layers check out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me denote the value of the k-th layer as L_k. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nI notice that each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_k.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it without calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the general formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the k-th layer, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2, we compute the innermost layer and work outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward, compute each layer using the formula L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}.\n\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, let's compute that. 9841*3. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

    "text": "Wait, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working out. Let's try that. The innermost part is (1 + 3). So, let's compute that first.\n\nCompute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so that's the innermost layer. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. So, that's the second layer: 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 1 + 39 = 40. So, the third layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 1 + 120 = 121. Fourth layer: 121.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Fifth layer: 364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364 first. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Sixth layer: 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Seventh layer: 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Eighth layer: 9841.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Ninth layer: 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. I thought the innermost was layer 1, and we went out to layer 9. But the original expression has nine layers, right? Let me check again. The original expression is 3 times a big parenthesis, which itself contains 1 + 3 times another parenthesis, and so on, nine times. So, when I computed up to the ninth layer, I got 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, after computing the innermost nine layers, we have 29524, and then we multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total is 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but maybe I should check one or two layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me check layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524*3. Let's do it another way to verify. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, after computing the innermost nine layers, which gave me 29524, I multiply that by 3 to get the final result. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Each time, I was computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds a 3 times the previous result plus 1. So, the first layer is 4, second is 13, third is 40, and so on, up to the ninth layer being 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each step is a linear recurrence relation. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by computing from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break down the computation step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3.

    "text": " Wait, but the entire expression is 3 times (something). So actually, each time, it's 3 multiplied by a term that's 1 plus 3 times another term. Let me try to compute each step starting from the innermost parentheses. Let's start with the innermost part: The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, let me note that down. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So that would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a general approach. Each layer seems to be 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., then each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Let me check if that's correct. From L1 to L2: L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Yes, that's correct. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. So, it seems like each subsequent layer is calculated by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can eventually get to the outermost layer, which will give me the total value inside the parentheses, and then I can multiply that by 3 as per the original problem. Wait, but the original problem is 3 multiplied by (the entire expression). So, the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is the outermost layer. Wait, let me confirm how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count them: Starting from the first ( after 3, each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 that's the outermost layer, which I'll call L9\n2. The next innermost is 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2013 that's L8\n3. And so on, until the innermost is L1: 1+3\n\nSo, there are 9 layers in total, from L1 to L9. Therefore, to compute the entire expression, I need to compute L1 through L9, starting from L1 and moving outward to L9, and then the final result is 3*L9. So, let's proceed step by step.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so L9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, right? Because the original problem is 3*(L9). So, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again to be sure. Maybe I can do it another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in computing L9. Let me go through L1 to L9 again quickly.\n\nL1: 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. Because sometimes when you count, you might miscount. Let me see: The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1+3( ... )) So, that's the first opening parenthesis.\n\nThen inside, another (1+3(...)), so that's the second.\n\nContinuing:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 1\n2. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2013 2\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2013 3\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2013 4\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2013 5\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2013 6\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2013 7\n8. 1+3(1+3))))))) \u2013 8\n9. 1+3))))))) \u2013 9\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, from L1 to L9. Therefore, my calculation is correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem without computing each layer step by step? Maybe using a formula for a geometric series or something? Because each layer seems to be a geometric progression.\n\nLet me consider that each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10.\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nTherefore, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( L(n) = 1 + 3 \\times L(n-1) \\), starting with \\( L(1) = 4 \\). By computing each subsequent layer up to \\( L(9) \\), we find that \\( L(9) = 29524 \\). Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n   - \\( L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( L2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( L3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( L4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( L5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( L6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( L7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( L8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( L9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So maybe it's better to work from the innermost outwards, computing each step as I go. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is the ninth layer: 1 + 3. So, that's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from the ninth layer). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the eighth layer gives us 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(result from the eighth layer). So that's 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, the seventh layer is 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from the seventh layer). So, 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, the sixth layer is 121. Continuing outward, the fifth layer would be 1 + 3*(121). Let's compute that: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So, the fifth layer is 364. Moving out to the fourth layer: 1 + 3*(364). Calculating that: 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, the fourth layer is 1093. Next, the third layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that: 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, the third layer is 3280. Now, moving out to the second layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Calculating that: 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, the second layer is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that: 3*9841 = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. But wait, the problem says 3 times that expression, right? So, the entire original problem is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, is that correct? Let me check my calculations again because 3*29524 seems like a big number, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right breakdown. Let me correct that. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each step to check. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Next, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think the solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplifying the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, we have A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that result until the outermost layer is reached. Using a recurrence relation approach, we confirm that the final value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": "Wait, no, actually, the innermost is the last one. Let me correct that. The innermost expression is the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe I should think of it as building up from the inside out. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost layer is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost layer). Since the innermost layer is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, the second layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, the third layer is 40. Continuing this way, each time we take the previous result, multiply by 3, add 1, and that's the next layer. Let me try to write this down step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I counted correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me check how many layers I computed. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so actually, each of these layers is a step, and after nine layers, we get to 29524, and then we multiply by 3 at the very end. So, let me confirm the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is the first layer.\n\nThen, each time we go out, we have another \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first layer after the initial 3 is (1 + 3(...))\n- Each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...))\n\nCounting the number of layers: starting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer until the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's parse it:\n\n- The first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...))\n- Inside that, it's (1 + 3(...)), which is the next layer\n- Each time, it's another (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\" before closing a parenthesis. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\" starting from the first one after the initial 3. So, in my earlier computation, I had 9 layers, leading up to 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Let me verify that.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we reach 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this value. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524 * 3\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nCompute 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\nCompute 500 * 3 = 1,500\n\nCompute 20 * 3 = 60\n\nCompute 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers, so the next step is to multiply by 3, which gives 88,572.\n\nBut let me double-check each step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the layers check out. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the multiplication again:\n\n29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me do it another way:\n\n29,524 * 3\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it might form a geometric progression. Let me explore that approach to confirm.\n\nThe expression inside the outermost 3 is a sum that repeats nine times. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous term). This is similar to a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1\n\n-2*K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, hold on. The initial condition is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1.\n\nSo, plug n=1 into the general solution:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n\n4.5 = 3*C\n\nC = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5\n\nSo, C = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the 9th term, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^5 is 243, so 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2.\n\nCompute 243^2:\n\n243 * 243\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n243 * 200 = 48,600\n\n243 * 40 = 9,720\n\n243 * 3 = 729\n\nAdd them together: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320; 58,320 + 729 = 59,049\n\nYes, 3^{10} = 59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nEverything checks out. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the process was:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure with repeating terms.\n\n2. Compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost, each time substituting the result into the next layer.\n\n3. Alternatively, model it as a recurrence relation and solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\n4. Both approaches led to the same result, confirming the answer.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by substituting the result of the previous layer into the next one. This process is repeated until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final value.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, actually, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me try to represent each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3). So, let's compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1).\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 times the first layer. So, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the entire expression would be 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let's see, 29524*3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. So, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again because sometimes when you're dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, and each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first opening parenthesis after 3: (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3))\n\nWait, no, that seems too many. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each is multiplied by 3 and added 1 in the outer layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen each time we go out, we have another 1+3*(Layer n).\n\nSo, starting from Layer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: (1+3*(Layer 1))\n\nLayer 3: (1+3*(Layer 2))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: (1+3*(Layer 8))\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first term is 3*(...), where the ... starts with (1 + 3*(...)), so that would be Layer 9, as above.\n\nSo, in total, we have 9 layers inside the first 3*(...).\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing so rapidly, and I want to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3^{10} =59,049, so a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=29,524, then 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression using the formula.\n\nSince a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177,147.\n\nSo, (177,147 -3)/2=177,144/2=88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make absolutely sure, let me compute 3^{11} manually.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2,187\n\n3^8=6,561\n\n3^9=19,683\n\n3^10=59,049\n\n3^11=177,147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, (177,147 -3)=177,144, divided by 2 is 88,572.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations now. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n1.

    "text": " Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So maybe I should think recursively. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. If the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then the next would be 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that seems correct so far.\n\nContinuing this way, let's see how many layers we have. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so perhaps 9 layers? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost 9 layers, we have to multiply the result by 3. So let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. Each time we go out a layer, we're adding another 1 + 3*(...). So if the innermost is 1 + 3, that's the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So if we have 9 layers, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n- So the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let's recount the layers step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, especially since this seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = A*r^{n} + (c/(1 - r)), provided r \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3, so the solution would be a_n = A*3^{n} + (1)/(1 - 3) = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nWe can find A using the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo both methods give the same result, which makes me confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let's see.\n\nEach time we expand a layer, we're adding another term. Let's try to write out the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the previous methods.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the expression as a sum. Let's see.\n\nEach time we have 1 + 3*(...), which can be thought of as 1 + 3*E, where E is the next layer.\n\nSo, expanding all the layers, we can write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand this step by step, writing out each multiplication:\n\nStart from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. It seems that no matter how I approach it, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each step again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nCompute E1 to E9:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, all the intermediate steps check out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nEach time we have 1 + 3*E, which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*E') = 1 + 3 + 9*E'\n\nContinuing this way, each layer adds another power of 3. So, perhaps the total expression is a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nLet me try to express E9 in terms of powers of 3.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*(9 + 3 + 1) = 1 + 27 + 9 + 3 = 40\n\nWait, but that seems a bit more complicated. Alternatively, maybe each E_n can be written as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as I found earlier.\n\nSo, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me see.\n\nIf I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nExpanding all the layers, each 1 contributes a 1 multiplied by 3^k for some k.\n\nWait, let me try to write the entire expression as a sum:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nIf I expand this, it would be:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me count how many 1's there are. Each layer adds another 1, so there are 9 layers, each contributing a 1 multiplied by 3^{n}, where n starts from 0.\n\nWait, no, actually, each 1 is multiplied by 3^{number of layers above it}.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model it as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers.\n\nThis would be equivalent to E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 8 layers inside the first 3*(...).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the formula I found earlier.\n\nBut since I've already confirmed it through multiple methods, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n3*29524:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2 with a carryover of 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5 with a carryover of 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8 with a carryover of 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying through multiple methods, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost 9 layers, the result is 29524. The entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

    "text": " Wait, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out. Let me start by computing the innermost expression and then build my way up. So, starting with the innermost parentheses: Let's see, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3 times that result. So, 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the second layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so the third layer is 40. Let me keep going. Next layer out: 1 + 3*40. So, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, fourth layer is 121. Next, fifth layer: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, fifth layer is 364. Sixth layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, sixth layer is 1093. Seventh layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate that. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, seventh layer is 3280. Eighth layer: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating that: 3280*3. Let's break it down: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, eighth layer is 9841. Ninth layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, ninth layer is 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer: 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4, correct. Then 1+3*4=13, correct. Next, 1+3*13=40, correct. Then, 1+3*40=121, correct. 1+3*121=364, correct. 1+3*364=1093, correct. 1+3*1093=3280, correct. 1+3*3280=9841, correct. 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Finally, 3*29524=88572, correct. So, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Working from the inside out:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is straightforward. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(result of innermost expression). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of previous layer), and so on, until I reach the outermost layer. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check: 1 + 3*13 is indeed 1 + 39, which is 40. Okay, moving on.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.

Finally, the outermost: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nWait, so that's nine layers of 1+3(...), right? So, my initial approach was correct, and I computed up to Layer 9, which gives me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any layers. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time I see a (1+3(, that's a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. The first innermost is 1+3\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3)\n4. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n5. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n6. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n9. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n10. Finally, the outermost: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Did I miscount the layers earlier? Because here, I'm seeing ten layers, but the problem only has nine sets of 1+3(...). Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the outermost 3 is not part of the layers but just a multiplier.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the outermost expression is 3 times the first layer, which itself contains nine layers of 1+3(...). Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each time, it's 1+3*(...). So, let's count how many times we have 1+3(...):\n\n1. The innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. Finally, the outermost: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's nine layers of 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that should be the innermost part of the outermost expression. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial counting, I thought there were nine layers, but now I'm seeing that the outermost is 3*(Layer 9), which is one more layer. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as each \"1+\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3*(...), that's a new layer. Let me try to write down each step with proper numbering.\n\nLet me try again, step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers, let me check each computation again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOutermost: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, I think I did this correctly. The key was to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, computing each layer step by step. It took a bit of time, but breaking it down made it manageable.\n\nI was a bit confused at first about the number of layers, but by carefully counting each 1+3(...) instance, I realized there are nine layers inside the outermost 3. So, computing each layer one by one up to Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3 gave me the final answer.\n\nI also made sure to double-check each multiplication to avoid mistakes, especially with larger numbers. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with numbers like 3280 or 9841, but breaking them down into smaller parts helped me compute accurately.\n\nIn conclusion, the problem required methodical step-by-step computation, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, ensuring each step was correct before proceeding to the next. This approach prevented errors and made the problem solvable despite its initial complexity.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, I compute the innermost expression first and then use that result in the outer expression. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the next layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute 3*88573. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding them: 240000+24000=264000, 264000+1500=265500, 265500+210=265710, 265710+9=265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times that entire expression, right? Because the outermost term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, after computing the innermost part all the way out to 265720, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me check: So, the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... evaluates to 265720. So, 3*265720. Let me compute that.\n\n3*265720: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding them together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, 780000 + 15000 = 795000, 795000 + 2100 = 797100, 797100 + 60 = 797160.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me verify my calculations because that number seems quite large, and I might have made an error somewhere. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n4. 1 + 3(...)\n5. 1 + 3(...)\n6. 1 + 3(...)\n7. 1 + 3(...)\n8. 1 + 3(...)\n9. 1 + 3(...)\n10. 1 + 3(...)\n\nWait, no. Wait, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n10. 3(\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me actually count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). Then each preceding one adds another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\n1. The innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. The next one: (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another: (1 + 3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). Then each preceding one adds a layer. So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the first 3, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n10. 3(\n\nWait, that's 10 opening parentheses, but that seems too much. Wait, no, because each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nAnd then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2 up to Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, that seems more accurate. Let me confirm:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as each (1 + 3(...)) is a new layer.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I went up to Layer 9 as 1 + 3*9841, which gave me 29524, and then I thought I had to multiply by 3, getting 88572. But that was incorrect because I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. Let me write each layer step by step, carefully, to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation. Earlier, I thought the final result was 797160, but that was because I miscounted the layers and multiplied by 3 again at the end, which was incorrect. So, actually, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 1 + 3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another: (1 + 3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each preceding one adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: each (1 + 3(...)) is a new layer. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, as I defined earlier.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3*29524 is 88572, but in my initial calculation, I went up to 265720 and then multiplied by 3 to get 797160, which was wrong because I had an extra layer.\n\nWait, no, I think I messed up the layer count earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29524, then the total is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, let's compute a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me check with another method to be sure. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values we have:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3^{10} to confirm:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, correct. So, (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 265720, but that was because I incorrectly multiplied by 3 at the end, thinking there were more layers. But according to this, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just go through the layers again to ensure I didn't miscount:\n\nLayer 1:4\n\nLayer 2:13\n\nLayer 3:40\n\nLayer 4:121\n\nLayer 5:364\n\nLayer 6:1093\n\nLayer 7:3280\n\nLayer 8:9841\n\nLayer 9:29524\n\nThen, total expression:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen, moving out:1 +3*4=13.\n\nNext:1 +3*13=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*40=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*121=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a single line, but that might be confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series, but given the recurrence, the closed-form formula seems the most straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer numerically again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested term from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the final layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should work step by step. Let me think. Each time, the expression inside is 1 plus 3 times the next expression. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, substituting the innermost result:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3*4, which is 1 + 12, indeed 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. So maybe I can see a pattern here. Let me write this down step by step to make sure I don't get lost.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each expression as E_n, where n is the number of layers from the innermost. Since there are nine layers, I need to compute E_1 to E_9.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I should think of it as starting from the innermost and working outward, so let's compute each step:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: Next layer out is 1 + 3*(Step 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next layer out is 1 + 3*(Step 2 result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Next layer out is 1 + 3*(Step 3 result) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems right.\n\nStep 5: Next layer out: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nStep 6: Next layer out: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nHmm, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nStep 7: Next layer out: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nStep 8: Next layer out: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nYes, 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nStep 9: Next layer out: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is multiplying the entire expression by 3. So after computing the innermost layers up to the ninth step, which gives 29524, we need to multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me write them out:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each layer is one more 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each next layer adds another 3(...). So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs.\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, so that's the first layer.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have 1 + 3*(...), so let's see:\n\nAfter the first innermost, we have 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is the second layer.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), third layer.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting after the first 3(, the first ( is the innermost, then each subsequent ( adds a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, since there are nine 3(...) terms after the first 3. Let me check:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, the 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, how many times do we have 1 + 3? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3.\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...).\n\nSo, perhaps the number of layers is 9. Therefore, when I computed up to 29524, that's after 9 layers, and then the outermost operation is 3*(that result). So, the total expression would be 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but when I computed step 9, I ended up with 29524, which is 1 + 3*(9841). So, that's the innermost expression after 9 layers, and then the outermost 3*(...) would be 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the expression has 8 layers, not 9. Let me recount.\n\nLet me write the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) occurs after the initial 3.\n\n- The first innermost is 1 + 3, which is one layer.\n- Then, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each time adding another 3*(previous result) + 1.\n\nThen, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot, but let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, so the total expression would be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted correctly. Let me recount the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8 because the initial 3 is outside the first (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 8 layers inside.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we add a layer, so:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me check if that's correct by computing each step again.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n__________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 another way.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I end up with 88,572 as the final result.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can find a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general form is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's a nonhomogeneous one. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is E_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form E_n^p = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition E_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, how many layers do we have?\n\nEarlier, I thought there were 9 layers, leading to E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it again using the formula.\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as starting with 3*(E_9), where E_9 is as above.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can think of the entire expression as 3*(E_9), where E_9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for the entire expression.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers inside.\n\nWait, but since each layer is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, and we have E_9 = 29524, then S = 3*E_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then S = 3*E_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, S = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, S = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, and each method leads to the same result, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

So, maybe I can create a table to keep track of each layer.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLayer 0: 1 + 3 = 4 (Innermost)\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 0) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression starts with 3 times the first layer. Let me check the structure again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, in my earlier breakdown, I computed up to Layer 9, which would be the innermost expression. But in the original problem, we have nine layers of 1 + 3(...), each nested inside the previous one, and then the whole thing is multiplied by 3. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...), each nested within the previous one. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in counting or computing.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWe can write the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for the 9th layer, which is a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the entire expression, not just the inner layers.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*(a_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( a_n \\), where each layer follows the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1.

    "text": " Wait, actually, let me think again. The expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (...))). So, each layer is actually 1 + 3*(next layer). So, maybe I should compute starting from the innermost 1+3 and work my way outwards. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(that result). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let's compute that.\n\n3*4 = 12\n1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that.\n\n3*13 = 39\n1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, that layer is 40. Continuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40).\n\n3*40 = 120\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nThat's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121)\n\n3*121 = 363\n1 + 363 = 364\n\nSo, that's 364. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364)\n\n3*364 = 1092\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHmm, 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093)\n\n3*1093 = 3279\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nThat's 3280. Now, another layer out: 1 + 3*(3280)\n\n3*3280 = 9840\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nSo, that's 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841)\n\n3*9841 = 29523\n1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThat's 29524. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524)\n\n3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so the total is 88572? Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. So, the final result is 88572. I think that makes sense. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is a common operation that can lead to exponential growth, but since we're doing it step by step, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a finite geometric series. Let me try to model it as such.\n\nIn general, for a nested expression like a + b(a + b(a + ... )), it can be represented as a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here.\n\nWait, but in this case, each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I let x be the innermost term, then each subsequent term is 1 + 3x, and so on. But since there are multiple layers, maybe I can model this recursively.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say that L_n is the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9, since there are nine layers.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so actually, the total expression is 3*L_9, where L_9 is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of layers again.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and each is multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 layer 1\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13 \u2192 layer 2\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40 \u2192 layer 3\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121 \u2192 layer 4\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364 \u2192 layer 5\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 \u2192 layer 6\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 \u2192 layer 7\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 \u2192 layer 8\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 \u2192 layer 9\n\nSo, layer 9 is the innermost part of the outermost multiplication. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n in terms of L_{n-1}. Since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence, so the solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence as:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n = 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn = 9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works for all the layers. Therefore, the 9th layer is L_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it directly using the formula, which confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result.\n\n3. Identify a pattern and derive a formula for the nth layer using a linear recurrence relation.\n\n4. Use the formula to compute the 9th layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n5. Verify the result using the formula directly.\n\nThis systematic approach helps avoid mistakes and ensures that each step is correct before moving on. It's especially useful for problems with repetitive structures, as it can save time compared to computing each layer manually.\n\nI think I've got it. The answer is 88572. I feel confident about this because I checked each step, used two different methods (step-by-step computation and formula derivation) to arrive at the same result, and even cross-verified using the formula for the nth term.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move outward and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue outward:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

Let's calculate that.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nMoving outward, Layer 6 is 1 + 3 times Layer 7, so 1 + 3*40. Let's do that.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nContinuing this way, Layer 5 is 1 + 3 times Layer 6, which is 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext, Layer 4 is 1 + 3 times Layer 5, so 1 + 3*364. Calculating that:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nMoving outward, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 4, which is 1 + 3*1093. Let me figure that out.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 3, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nFinally, Layer 1 (the outermost layer) is 1 + 3 times Layer 2, which is 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate that.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3 times this entire expression. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1). So, after computing Layer 1 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3)\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems quite large. Let me verify my calculations step by step because that number seems big, and I might have made an error in one of the layers.\n\nStarting again from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems like each step checks out. So, maybe 88572 is indeed the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, in my earlier steps, a_9 was 4, a_8 was 13, a_7 was 40, and so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_9 = 4.\n\nSo, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_9 = 4.\n\nThen, a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_1 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n in this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear, so perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me check that.\n\nActually, the standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + b. In this case, k = 3 and b = 1. So, the solution is a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up the formula.\n\nLet me recall. For a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). But in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so c = 3 and d = 1.\n\nSo, the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^{n}*a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nBut wait, in our problem, we have a_9 = 4. Let me think about how the indices work here. Let's consider that a_9 is the innermost term, so when n = 9, a_9 = 4. Then, a_8 is 1 + 3*a_9, and so on up to a_1.\n\nIf I consider a_9 as the starting point, then a_9 = 4, and a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9, which would correspond to n = 8. So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that the innermost term is a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, and so on up to a_8, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, if I let a_0 = 4, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8, which is 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, no, that's not matching my earlier calculation. Wait, hold on.\n\nWait, no, in my earlier breakdown, I had Layer 1 as 29524, which was 1 + 3*a_2, but perhaps I'm getting confused with the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the layers properly. Let me define a_0 as the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so a_8 is 29524, which is the result of the innermost expression after 8 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_8, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is a_0 = 4, then a_1 = 13, up to a_8 = 29524, and then the total is 3*a_8, which is 88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me try that.\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_0 = 4.\n\nSo, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) + 3^{n} * a_0. Wait, that might not be the exact formula, but let me check.\n\nWait, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition a_0 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{0} - 1/2 => 4 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (9*3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_8, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3:\n\na_8 = (9*3^{8} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_8 = (9*6561 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_8 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and even trying to model it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer each time. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that the correct result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer outward:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4.

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, maybe I should work from the innermost outwards, calculating each step as I go. Let me try that. Let me start with the innermost parentheses, which is the ninth layer: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. So, Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 8 is 13. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 7 is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a formula or a pattern that can help me compute this without having to calculate each layer individually, especially since there are nine layers. But maybe for accuracy, it's better to compute each layer step by step, especially since it's only nine layers. Let me continue.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 6 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 4 is 1093.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 3 is 3280.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 2 is 9841.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 1 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not getting confused with the layers. I think I miscounted. Let me recount the layers to ensure I'm working correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, that's 1 + 3, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n+1). So, actually, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. Wait, that's the opposite of what I did before. So, perhaps I should have started with Layer 1 as the innermost and worked up to Layer 9 as the outermost.\n\nWait, that might be where I went wrong earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me index the layers from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is Layer 9.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, so let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do that step by step.\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. I think I might have miscounted the layers earlier. Let me recount to ensure that Layer 9 is indeed the outermost one. Let me write out the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Each time we move outward, we add another layer. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an error in one of the steps.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with n layers. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, for n from 1 to 9.\n\nWait, but actually, it's more like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the next term. So, starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 is the outermost term, which is 1 + 3*a_8, and a_8 is 1 + 3*a_7, etc., down to a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the entire expression is 3*a_9, right? Because the outermost 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is a_9.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me try to write the recurrence.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, if we start from the innermost, a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nSo, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWe can write this as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121.

Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with the step-by-step computation I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression derived from the recurrence relation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes in the multiplication step.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12.

Correct.\n\nL8: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 +840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 3*9841. Let me compute that:\n\n9000*3=27,000\n\n800*3=2,400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo, 27,000 +2,400=29,400 +120=29,520 +3=29,523. Plus 1 is 29,524.

So the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers. Maybe I can compute it another way, like using a formula for such a nested expression. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a geometric series or a recursive formula.\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have an expression like x = 1 + 3x, but that's a single equation. But in this case, it's nested multiple times. Wait, but each layer is x = 1 + 3x, but each time x is defined in terms of the next layer. So perhaps each layer is part of a geometric progression.\n\nWait, let's consider that each layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's check that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and a particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1 =4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So each layer L_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, 3^{10} is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88,572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've done this correctly, but just to be thorough, let me compute it step by step again without using the formula.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1 =1+3=4\n\nL2=1+3*4=13\n\nL3=1+3*13=40\n\nL4=1+3*40=121\n\nL5=1+3*121=364\n\nL6=1+3*364=1093\n\nL7=1+3*1093=3280\n\nL8=1+3*3280=9841\n\nL9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88,572.\n\nYes, same result. I think I'm confident now that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

    "text": " Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, I take the previous result, multiply by 3, add 1, and that becomes the next layer. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. So, Layer 1 is 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121: Let's compute that. 120*3 = 360, and 1*3 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\nCalculating 3*364: 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: Let me break that down. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: 3000*3 = 9000, 280*3 = 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let me compute this. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is Layer 9. So, once I compute Layer 9, I need to multiply it by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524*3.\n\nBreaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12.\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I should write it out digit by digit:\n\n29524\ntimes 3\n________\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2\nNow, the next digit is 2 (from 29524, which is the ten-thousands place), so 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carryover 0\nBut wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3, after 9*3=27, we carryover 2 to the next digit, which is 2 (the ten thousands place). So, 2*3=6 +2=8. There are no more digits, so write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't match the previous result. Wait, let me recount:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12: write 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7: write 7, carryover 0\n5*3=15: write 5, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8: write 8, carryover 0\nSo, the digits are: 8 (from the ten thousands place), then 7 (from thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 87572.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation where I got 88572. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my initial breakdown.\n\nWait, in the initial breakdown, I thought of 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4, but when I multiplied each by 3, I added them as 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12, which totals 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572.\n\nBut when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. These two results don't match, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check the digit-by-digit multiplication again:\n\n29524\ntimes 3\n________\nStarting from the units place:\n4*3=12: write 2, carryover 1\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7: write 7, carryover 0\nNext digit:5*3=15: write 5, carryover 1\nNext digit:9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carryover 2\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8: write 8, carryover 0\nSo, writing from top to bottom: 8 (from the ten thousands place), then 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 87572.\n\nBut in the other method, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy in the thousands place: 7 vs 8. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me add the components again:\n\n20000*3=60000\n9000*3=27000\n500*3=1500\n20*3=60\n4*3=12\n\nAdding 60000 +27000=87000\n87000 +1500=88500\n88500 +60=88560\n88560 +12=88572\n\nHmm, that's correct, so why does the digit-by-digit method give me 87572?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits in the digit-by-digit method. Let me write 29524 as:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying each by 3:\n\n2 (ten thousands) *3=6 (hundred thousands)\n9 (thousands)*3=27 (ten thousands)\n5 (hundreds)*3=15 (thousands)\n2 (tens)*3=6 (hundreds)\n4 (units)*3=12 (tens and units)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each digit is multiplied by 3 and added with carryover.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it out more carefully:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 (units) *3=12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 (tens)*3=6 +1(carryover)=7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit:5 (hundreds)*3=15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit:9 (thousands)*3=27 +1(carryover)=28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit:2 (ten thousands)*3=6 +2(carryover)=8. Write down 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, writing the digits from last to first: 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 87572. But when I broke it down into place values, I got 88572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, 29524*3: Let me compute it using another method. Let's compute 29524*3:\n\n29524\n+29524\n+29524\n= ?\n\nAdding them up:\n\nFirst, add 29524 + 29524:\n\n4+4=8\n\n2+2=4\n\n5+5=10, write down 0, carryover 1\n\n9+9=18 +1=19, write down 9, carryover 1\n\n2+2=4 +1=5\n\nSo, 29524 +29524=59048.\n\nNow, add 59048 +29524:\n\n8+4=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n4+2=6 +1=7\n\n0+5=5\n\n9+9=18, write down 8, carryover 1\n\n5+2=7 +1=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. So, where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit method?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me try again:\n\n29524\ntimes 3\n________\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4*3=12: write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +1=7: write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit:5*3=15: write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8: write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, writing the digits: 8 (from the ten thousands place), then 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 87572. But when adding 29524 three times, I get 88572. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check the addition method, which seems more reliable. 29524 +29524=59048, then 59048 +29524=88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was incorrect because I miscounted the carryover or the digits. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, going back, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me verify the layers again because if I messed up any layer, the final result would be wrong.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1:1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got confused and thought it was 87572, but the addition method clearly shows it's 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method, probably misaligning the digits.\n\nTherefore, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 29524*3 once more:\n\n29524\ntimes 3\n________\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3=12: write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +1=7: write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit:5*3=15: write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8: write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88572. Oh! Wait, I think I was writing them in the wrong order earlier.\n\nWait, when I do the multiplication, I start from the right and move left, so the first digit I write is the units place, then tens, hundreds, etc. So, the digits I get are:\n\nFrom right to left: 2 (units), 7 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 8 (thousands), 8 (ten thousands).\n\nSo, writing them left to right: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. That's correct.\n\nSo, I must have misaligned the digits earlier when I thought it was 87572. So, the correct result is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it using another method. Let's break down 29524 into 29000 + 524.\n\n29000*3=87000\n\n524*3=1572\n\nAdding them together: 87000 +1572=88572.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": "Wait, actually, let me correct that. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out, computing each layer as I go. Let me try that. Let me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each level as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4\nWait, that's 1 + 12 = 13\nThen, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13\nWhich is 1 + 39 = 40\nWait, that seems too big. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me go step by step.\n\nStarting with L1: The innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? So, 1 + 3 equals 4. So, L1 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, L2 is 1 + 3*(L1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, L2 = 13.\n\nNext, L3 is 1 + 3*(L2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, L3 = 40.\n\nThen, L4 is 1 + 3*(L3). 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, L4 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, L5 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, L6 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, L7 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, L8 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Now, 3*9841. Let's compute that. 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400; 29,400 + 120 is 29,520; 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. So, 3*9841 is 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 is 29,524. So, L9 = 29,524.\n\nWait a minute, but the original problem is 3 times (L9). Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by L9. So, 3*29,524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29,524. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step because this seems like a lot of computation and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to check.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400=29,400; 29,400 + 120=29,520; 29,520 + 3=29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29,524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, that seems really large. Let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and each layer is one more set of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, nine layers in total, right? Because I started from L1 to L9, each time computing the next layer.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost expression is 3*(...).\n\nSo, each time, the number of layers increases by one. So, in total, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2014 the first ( after 3 is layer 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should just compute each layer step by step, as I did before, and see if the result makes sense.\n\nWait, but 88,572 seems correct based on the computations, but let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that matches what I calculated earlier. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for a_n. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1\n\n-2*K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSo, 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1:\n\na1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I found earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I can't spot any errors in the calculations, and the closed-form approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the solution is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, looking again, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I should approach it by starting from the innermost and working outwards. Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me try to count how many layers there are. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there's 1 + 3, then each time it's wrapped by another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied: Each time, after the first, it's multiplied by the next expression. Let me see, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(first layer), that's the second. Then the third is 1 + 3*(second layer), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are 8 opening parentheses. Therefore, there are 8 layers inside. Wait, no, because each opening parenthesis is part of a layer. Let me try a different approach: Let me think of each layer as a term. The innermost term is 1 + 3, which is the first term. Then each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, the number of terms is equal to the number of layers. Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" appears. From the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, inside the first 3(...), there's 1+3(...), which itself contains another 1+3(...), and so on. Let me see, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one layer. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer has a closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of closing parentheses: There's 8 closing parentheses after the first 3. Wait, no, actually, the expression is: 3 followed by (1+3(...)), so the first closing parenthesis is at the end of the innermost 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another closing parenthesis. Let me think again. Maybe it's better to approach it step by step. Let me start by computing the innermost expression first and then work my way outwards. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from innermost). So, substituting, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from previous layer). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, is that right? Wait, let me double-check. So, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing all the layers, which give us 29524, we then multiply by 3. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me check that again because I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the layers. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count how many \"1+3(\" there are. Starting from the first ( after the initial 3, each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(\". Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(\", so Layer 2, Layer 3, up to Layer 8, because after the initial 3, there are 8 layers. Wait, no, let me see: The expression is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. Wait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try a different approach: Let me write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check again because earlier I thought there were 8 layers, but now I'm getting 9 layers. Let me make sure.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nStarting from the first 3, the first layer is 1+3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" starts a new layer. So, from the expression:\n\n- The first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3 is Layer 1.\n\n- Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\" is Layer 2.\n\n- Continuing, up to the point where there are 8 \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. Wait, no, let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count how many \"1+3(\" are there.\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n\n2. ...1+3(...\n\n3. ...1+3(...\n\n4. ...1+3(...\n\n5. ...1+3(...\n\n6. ...1+3(...\n\n7. ...1+3(...\n\n8. ...1+3(...\n\n9. ...1+3)))\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead think of the number of times I have to compute 1 + 3*(...). Each time I go one layer out, I compute the next value. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then each subsequent layer uses that result. Let me list them again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 8 layers, but now I'm getting 9 layers, leading to 88572. But let me check the original expression again to make sure how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3\" parts:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3.\n\n- Then each layer adds another 1+3(...).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until we have 8 layers inside the initial 3(...). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to count the number of \"1+3(\" expressions after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" after the initial 3 is a new layer.\n\nSo, let me count:\n\nAfter the initial 3, the first \"1+3(\" is Layer 1.\n\nThen, inside that, another \"1+3(\" is Layer 2.\n\nContinuing until Layer 8, because the expression ends with 8 closing parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, no, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the initial 3, the number of layers is 8, because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 8 of them.\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the initial 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first \"1+3(\" is Layer 1.\n\nThen, inside that, another \"1+3(\" is Layer 2.\n\nContinuing until Layer 8, because after the initial 3, there are 8 \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3, I see 8 instances:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n\n2. ...1+3(\n\n3. ...1+3(\n\n4. ...1+3(\n\n5. ...1+3(\n\n6. ...1+3(\n\n7. ...1+3(\n\n8. ...1+3(\n\nAnd then it ends with ))))))) So, 8 layers. Therefore, the innermost is Layer 8, which is 1+3=4.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed, I had 9 layers, but if there are 8 layers, then Layer 8 would be the result after 8 computations. Let me adjust my earlier approach.\n\nIf there are 8 layers, then:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier computation where I had 9 layers leading to 88572. Now I'm confused. Let me clarify.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the initial 3 is considered a layer or not. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is a nested expression with 8 layers of 1+3*(...).\n\nSo, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nBut wait, when I computed earlier with 9 layers, I got 88572, but that seems incorrect because the initial 3 is outside all the layers. So, the layers are 8, and the final result is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut let me check the original expression again to make sure. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times I have to compute 1+3*(...):\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nSo, that's 8 layers, leading to 9841.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had 9 layers, I got 29524, but that must have been a mistake because the initial 3 is outside all the layers. So, the correct computation is 8 layers, leading to 9841, then multiplied by 3 gives 29523.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by actually computing each layer step by step, carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*Layer 8 = 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nCompute 9000*3 = 27,000\n\n800*3 = 2,400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdd them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400\n\n29,400 + 120 = 29,520\n\n29,520 + 3 = 29,523\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29,523\n\nTherefore, the final result is 29,523.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 88572, but that was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct answer is 29,523.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original expression again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3*(...)\".\n\nCounting the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n- After the initial 3, the first \"1+3(\" is Layer 1.\n\n- Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\" is Layer 2.\n\n- Continuing until Layer 8, because after the initial 3, there are 8 \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nThus, 8 layers, leading to Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nThen, 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 29,523.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost outwards.

    "text": " Wait, actually, maybe I should think of each layer as starting from the innermost and building outwards. Let me try to compute each step starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let's start with the innermost expression: The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that innermost expression. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that layer equals 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, 121. Next: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, okay, so that's 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's see, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Wow, that's getting big. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is... let me compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, plus 1 is 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524. Now, the next layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. Hmm, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, plus 1 is 88573. Finally, the outermost layer: 3 times that result. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those up: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, putting it all together, each layer builds upon the previous one, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), until we get to the outermost layer, which is 3 times the last result we got, which is 265719. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Finally, 3*88573 = 265719. Hmm, that seems consistent.

    "text": " Wait, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's see, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, (1 + 3) is 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So that layer is 13. Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, so each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.

Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. The original expression has nine sets of (1+3(...)), so each time I compute a layer, I should have nine layers. Let me recount: Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3)=4. Then each subsequent layer adds one more computation. Let me list each step with the layer number to ensure I didn't skip any.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I correctly accounted for all the layers. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's the innermost part before the outermost 3. So, yes, then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recursive function. Let me think about it as f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, for n=2, f(2)=1+3*4=13. n=3, f(3)=1+3*13=40, and so on, up to n=9, which would be f(9)=1+3*f(8). Then, the total expression is 3*f(9). So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, computing up to f(9)=29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the expression is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, f(1)=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, I can compute 3^10 directly. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, yes, 3^10 is 59049. Then, (59049 - 1)/2 is 59048/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute each layer step by step again, to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nFinal step: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So maybe I should start from the innermost and work my way out. Let me try computing each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses, which is the 9th layer: 1 + 3.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nLayer 2: 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13: that's 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nLayer 3: 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLayer 4: 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 5: 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: let's compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\nLayer 6: 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 7: 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 8: 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLayer 9: 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. But the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. So adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, total 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, total 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, total 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, total 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524 again. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to compute 3*29524 is to do it directly. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nCompute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, same as before.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer), it seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number from the inside out. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWait, this seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nIf I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might make it easier to compute without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if there are more layers. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 9841\n\na_9 = 29524\n\nHmm, let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let me compute the ratio between successive terms:\n\na_2 / a_1 = 13 / 4 = 3.25\n\na_3 / a_2 = 40 / 13 \u2248 3.077\n\na_4 / a_3 = 121 / 40 = 3.025\n\na_5 / a_4 = 364 / 121 \u2248 3.008\n\na_6 / a_5 = 1093 / 364 \u2248 3.000\n\na_7 / a_6 = 3280 / 1093 \u2248 3.000\n\na_8 / a_7 = 9841 / 3280 \u2248 3.000\n\na_9 / a_8 = 29524 / 9841 \u2248 3.000\n\nSo, it seems that as n increases, the ratio approaches 3. That makes sense because each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so for large n, a_n \u2248 3*a_{n-1}, which is a geometric sequence with ratio 3.\n\nBut for the exact terms, we have a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence relation:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2*A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3*C\n\n9/2 = 3*C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier terms to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 works for each layer. Therefore, for the innermost layer (n=1), a_1=4, and for the outermost layer (n=9), a_9=29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute each layer without having to compute each step manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers increases.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize a recursive pattern where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the next layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using a derived formula, we compute each layer step by step. The formula for the nth layer is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula to the outermost layer (n=9) gives us 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Wait, actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? So that's the first part. Let me compute that. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from innermost). So, if the innermost is 4, the next layer would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So that's the second layer: 13. Then, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, third layer: 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me keep going step by step. Fourth layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Fifth layer: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Sixth layer: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Seventh layer: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Eighth layer: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Ninth layer: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Wait, but hold on, the original expression has nine layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, after computing the innermost one, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, I think I did that correctly. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miss any. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 is 4. Then, each time, 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, then 1 + 3*40 = 121, then 1 + 3*121 = 364, then 1 + 3*364 = 1093, then 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, then 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Wait, but the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so perhaps I missed one layer? Let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, that's the first set. Then each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...): There are nine 1 + 3(...) expressions. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's one. Then each time we go out, that's another layer. So, perhaps I need to compute nine layers. Wait, but in my previous calculation, I only went up to the ninth layer and got 29524. But the expression is 3*(...), so after computing all the inner layers, we have 3 times that result. So, perhaps I need to compute the innermost part, then each layer, and then finally multiply by 3 at the end. Let me try to structure this properly. Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's see, 29524*3. 29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the innermost part after 9 layers is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series or something similar, but given that each term is defined recursively, the approach I took seems appropriate.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I did this correctly. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing it another way. Maybe by expanding the expression.\n\nWait, expanding it would be very tedious because it's nested nine times. But perhaps I can write it as a sum.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me write it as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me define each layer as I did before. So, E = 3*a_9, where a_9 is the ninth layer.\n\nAlternatively, since I have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nTherefore, E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Which matches my previous result.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm it.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29,524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, actually, the innermost part is the 1 + 3 at the very end. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) So, starting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost expression, and L9 is the outermost one. Wait, actually, counting from the innermost, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the ninth layer? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's count the number of 1+3 terms. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then moving outward, each time we have (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps there are 9 layers of this. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n4. (1 + 3*(...))\n5. (1 + 3*(...))\n6. (1 + 3*(...))\n7. (1 + 3*(...))\n8. (1 + 3*(...))\n9. (1 + 3*(...))\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers. So, I can compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nUp to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the entire expression is 3*(...), which is 3*L9, but each L_i is 1 + 3*L_{i-1}.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe innermost is L1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving outward, L2 = 1 + 3*L1.\n\nThen, L3 = 1 + 3*L2.\n\nContinuing this way until L9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost layer is 3*(L9), where L9 is the innermost expression.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust my layers. Let me try to write down each step.\n\nLet me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*(innermost)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(previous layer) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me count how many layers I have:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that's nine layers, each computed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is defined as L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general form is L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}, where a=1 and r=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is L_n = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + L0, but I need to check.\n\nWait, actually, the standard solution for L_n = a + r*L_{n-1} is L_n = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + C, but perhaps I need to adjust it.\n\nWait, let me consider the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the RHS is a constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying initial condition. Wait, but what is L0?\n\nWait, in our case, L1=4, which is when n=1.\n\nSo, let's set n=1: L1=4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, L1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, but starting from 4.\n\nBut regardless, the step-by-step computation and the formula both lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should consider that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me try computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2: 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). That's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3: 40.\n\nContinuing this way, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6: 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7: 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8: 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let me break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9: 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n- 50000 + 20000 = 70000\n- 9000 + 9000 = 18000\n- 48 + 24 = 72\nWait, that's not the right way. Let's add properly:\n\n59048\n+29524\n= ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n4 + 2 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n0 + 5 = 5.\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n5 + 2 + 1 = 8.\nSo the sum is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be more efficient or serve as a check. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a recurrence. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = 4\nn=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\nn=3: a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n... which is exactly what I did earlier. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without going through each layer, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrive at the same answer, I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and start computing from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of the results.\n\n3. After computing all layers up to the ninth, multiply the result by 3.\n\n4. Alternatively, model the problem as a recurrence relation, solve it, and compute the result using the formula, which serves as a good verification.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nHmm, 29524 * 3. Let me compute step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure.\n\n29524\nx      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I have the right number of layers.

The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Each time I see a 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nStarting from the first 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9. So yes, that's nine layers. So my earlier computation up to Layer 9 is correct.\n\nBut wait, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nLet me confirm the computations for each layer again, just to be thorough.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I feel like 88,572 is a pretty large number. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step. Maybe there's a geometric series or something here.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4.\n\nSo this is a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nI know that for such linear recurrences, we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = C*b^{n} + (a)/(1 - b), assuming b \u2260 1.\n\nWait, but let me check the recurrence relation.\n\nActually, the standard form is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe solution is L_n = C*b^n + (a)/(1 - b), where C is determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn our case, a = 1, b = 3.\n\nSo the general solution would be L_n = C*3^n + (1)/(1 - 3) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, so that's the answer. But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n--------\nLet's do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can break down 29,524 * 3 as:\n\n(20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59,049, so 3^11=177,147.\n\nThus, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144 / 2 = 88,572. Perfect, same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the result is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, I started by recognizing the nested structure, realized each layer could be computed step by step, then noticed a pattern that allowed me to use a recurrence relation and a closed-form formula to find the value more efficiently. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered each step, checked my work with different methods, and arrived at the same conclusion each time. So I feel good about this solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize a nested pattern that can be computed layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. \n\nUsing a recurrence relation, we determine the closed-form solution for each layer, which leads us to the final result after multiplying by 3. The final computation confirms that the solution is 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Wait, actually, maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost layer simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost layer). Since the innermost layer is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, and 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous layer). The previous layer was 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, and 1 + 39 = 40. So, this layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, and 1 + 120 = 121. So, this layer is 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121). Calculating that: 3*121 = 363, and 1 + 363 = 364. So, this layer is 364.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute 3*364 first. Hmm, 364*3. Let me compute that: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, this layer is 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, this layer is 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, this layer is 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, this layer is 29524.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, this layer is 88573.\n\nNow, the entire expression inside the outermost 3(...) is 88573. So, the final step is to compute 3*(88573). Let me calculate that. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when breaking down large numbers, it's easy to miscalculate.\n\nSo, 88573 * 3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n- 3 * 7 = 21, carry over 2\n- 3 * 5 = 15, plus the carried 2 is 17, carry over 1\n- 3 * 8 = 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, carry over 2\n- 3 * 8 = 24, plus the carried 2 is 26.\n\nSo, writing it down: 265719. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer's value is as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: 4\n2. Next: 13\n3. Next: 40\n4. Next: 121\n5. Next: 364\n6. Next: 1093\n7. Next: 3280\n8. Next: 9841\n9. Next: 29524\n10. Next: 88573\n\nThen, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives 265719.\n\nWait, but let me recount how many layers I have. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, I think I might have miscounted the layers earlier. Let me check.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 88573\n\nWait, that's 10 layers, but the original problem only has nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me look again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. The first ( is at the innermost: (1+3)\n2. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+3(...)\" sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nEach time, the number increases by one. So, from the innermost to the outermost, it's nine layers. So, perhaps my earlier count was correct, and I ended up with 10 layers, but that might be because I included the outermost 3(...) as a layer, which might not be necessary. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the expression is 3 multiplied by a sum that has nine layers of (1 + 3(...)). So, the structure is: 3*(layer1), where layer1 is (1 + 3*(layer2)), and so on until layer9, which is (1 + 3). So, actually, there are nine layers inside the outermost 3. So, when I computed up to 88573, that was the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, perhaps my earlier count was correct, and I had nine layers inside, each contributing to the total. So, the final result after multiplying by 3 is 265719.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recount each step, making sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, that's 10 layers again. But the original problem only has nine sets of parentheses. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many opening parentheses are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. The first ( is after the first 3: 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another ( after that: 3(1+3(1+3(...\n3. Continuing, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n10. 3(\n\nWait, that's 10 opening parentheses, but the problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, perhaps I miscounted. Let me write it out:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a separate layer, but each time it's wrapped in another set of parentheses. So, let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then, moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3\" appears, each time nested inside another set of parentheses.\n\nLooking at the problem, after the initial 3, there are nine sets of parentheses: each (1+3(...)). So, each of those is a layer. So, perhaps there are nine layers, each corresponding to one (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is (1+3(...)). So, the innermost is (1+3), then the next is (1+3(...)), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to note that each time you have a \"1+3(...)\", it's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, the first layer is (1+3), then each subsequent layer is (1+3*(previous layer)). So, if there are nine such layers, then the outermost layer is the ninth.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I ended up with 10 layers because I included the initial 3 as a layer, but perhaps that's not necessary. Let me clarify.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(layer1), where layer1 is (1 + 3*(layer2)), layer2 is (1 + 3*(layer3)), and so on until layer9, which is (1 + 3). So, there are nine layers inside the initial 3*(...). Therefore, when I computed up to 88573, that was the value of layer9, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 10 layers because I started counting from the innermost as layer1, then each time moving out, adding another layer. So, perhaps that's correct, because the initial 3 is outside of all the layers, and the layers themselves are nine in number.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to write the expression with each layer clearly defined.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo,\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n...\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, starting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the outermost layer was 88573, but now I'm getting L9 as 29524, which would make the total expression 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that's different from my earlier result. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see. If L1 is the innermost, then L9 is the ninth layer, which is the one just inside the outermost 3. So, then the expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524.\n\nBut earlier, when I was counting layers, I went up to 88573, which would be L10, but if there are only nine layers, then L9 is 29524, and the total is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach by considering the outermost layer as an additional step.\n\nWait, let me clarify the structure again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3), which is L1.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is (1 + 3*L(n)), where n increases by 1 each time.\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(L9), where L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd L8 = 1 + 3*L7\n\nAnd so on, down to L1 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, there are nine layers, L1 to L9.\n\nSo, computing each layer:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation where I ended up with 265719. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nAh, I think I miscounted the layers. Initially, I thought there were ten layers, but actually, there are only nine layers inside the outermost 3. Therefore, L9 is 29524, and the total is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I had ten layers, which included the outermost 3 as a layer, but that's incorrect because the outermost 3 is just a multiplier, not another layer of (1 + 3*...). So, I should have stopped at L9 and then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again by computing each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCompute L1 to L9:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I must have made a mistake earlier by considering an extra layer, leading to the wrong total of 265719. The correct total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to ensure I'm not miscounting the layers.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a new layer, and each is wrapped in another (1 + 3*(...)). So, let's count the number of (1+3) instances.\n\nEach time you have a (1+3), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to nine layers.\n\nYes, so L1 is (1+3), L2 is (1+3*L1), and so on until L9, which is (1+3*L8). Then, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is up to L9, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing up to 88573, that was because I considered an extra layer beyond L9, which was incorrect. So, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a different approach to be absolutely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 (since we have nine layers), L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches my corrected earlier calculation. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI must have made a mistake earlier by miscounting the layers and including an extra multiplication by 3, leading to an incorrect total of 265719. The correct approach is to recognize that there are nine layers inside the outermost 3, compute each layer using the recurrence relation, and then multiply the ninth layer by 3 to get the final result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For nine layers, this results in \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, maybe each layer is built by taking the previous result and plugging it into the next one. Let me try to compute each step starting from the innermost.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: Let's see, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? So, that would be 1 + 3 = 4. Let's call that Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13.\n\nNext layer out, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 = 360, 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000*3 = 27000.\n\n500*3 = 1500.\n\n20*3 = 60.\n\n4*3 = 12.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, adding up all the parts:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because that's a lot of computation, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1, r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), but wait, actually, the formula for a linear recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a bit different.\n\nWait, let me recall: for a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*r^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = r*B + c => B - r*B = c => B*(1 - r) = c => B = c/(1 - r). So, the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_0: a_0 = A*r^0 + c/(1 - r) => A = a_0 - c/(1 - r).\n\nTherefore, a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - r)) * r^n + c/(1 - r).\n\nSimplify: a_n = a_0*r^n - c*r^n/(1 - r) + c/(1 - r) = a_0*r^n + c*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r).\n\nWait, let me see: a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - r)) * r^n + c/(1 - r) = a_0*r^n - c*r^n/(1 - r) + c/(1 - r) = a_0*r^n + c/(1 - r)*(1 - r^n).\n\nSo, yes, a_n = a_0*r^n + c*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r).\n\nIn our case, a_1 = 4, and the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from n=1.\n\nWait, but in the standard form, a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, so here r=3, c=1.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers, so we start from a_1 up to a_9.\n\nWait, but in the standard formula, a_n is defined for n >= 0, but here our first term is a_1. So, let's adjust the indices.\n\nLet me set n=0 corresponding to the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_0 = 4.\n\nThen, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_8, since we have 9 layers (from a_0 to a_8). Wait, no, let's see: the innermost is a_0, then a_1, a_2,... up to a_8, which would be the 9th term. So, our outermost layer is a_8, which is 1 + 3*a_7, and then the entire expression is 3*a_8.\n\nSo, to compute a_8, we can use the formula for the linear recurrence.\n\nUsing the formula: a_n = a_0*r^n + c*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r).\n\nGiven a_0 = 4, r = 3, c = 1, n = 8.\n\nSo, a_8 = 4*3^8 + 1*(1 - 3^8)/(1 - 3).\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_8 = 4*6561 + (1 - 6561)/(1 - 3).\n\nCompute each part:\n\n4*6561: 4*6000=24000, 4*561=2244, so total is 24000 + 2244 = 26244.\n\n(1 - 6561)/(1 - 3) = (-6560)/(-2) = 3280.\n\nSo, a_8 = 26244 + 3280 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize that each layer is generating a number that's one more than a multiple of 3, but I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series, but it's a bit more complicated because each term depends on the previous one.\n\nWait, another approach: Each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(something), which is similar to 1 + 3x, which can be thought of as a linear function. If I keep applying this function multiple times, it's like function composition.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating it. The step-by-step approach seems straightforward, and the recurrence formula also confirms the result.\n\nSo, I think I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYep, same result each time. I think I'm solid here.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Wait, perhaps I should think of each step as a separate computation. Let me try to compute each nested part step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the second layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. So, the third layer is 40. Continuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. The fourth layer is 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Fifth layer is 364. Then, 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Sixth layer is 1093. Next, 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Seventh layer is 3280. Then, 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Eighth layer is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Ninth layer is 29524. Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 times that entire expression. So, after computing the innermost parentheses and working outwards, the entire expression inside the outermost 3(...) is 29524. Therefore, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's incorrect because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, adding up each part: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I computed each step correctly. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me check each step again to be sure. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. a_3=1+3*a_2=1+39=40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1. Solving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the value inside the outermost 3(...) is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression using the formula. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(a_9). Since a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2= (3*59048)/2. Wait, 59048 divided by 2 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572, which is the same result. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's another way to see it. So, the expression can be simplified to (3^{11} -3)/2, which equals 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, Layer 3 is 40. Continuing this way.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Each time I go a layer out, I'm adding another 3*(...). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, if I have nine layers, I should compute up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. But in the original problem, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, maybe I need to compute up to Layer 9 and then multiply by 3. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, no. Let me look again. The entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is a sum that includes nine layers. So, if I compute the innermost parentheses first, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 24*3=72, carry over 7. 2*3=6 +7=13, carry over 1. 5*3=15 +1=16, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when you do a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's see. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nTo solve such a recurrence, we can find a closed-form formula. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n}*(a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), but let me make sure.\n\nWait, the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + d. In our case, r = 3 and d = 1. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + d*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). But in our case, a_1 = 4, so a_0 would be the term before a_1, which would be 1 + 3*a_0 = a_1 = 4. So, 1 + 3*a_0 = 4, which implies a_0 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1. So, a_0 = 1.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^{n}*1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test it with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as a_1=4.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives the value at each layer n. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms our earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to compute it without using the formula, we could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, which is a geometric progression. So, perhaps recognizing the pattern early on could have saved some time, but since it's only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you go a layer out, you're effectively tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, it's a process of repeated tripling and adding one, which is a common operation in certain algorithms and can be represented as a geometric series.\n\nLet me also think about the multiplication by 3 at the end. Since the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, we can consider the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but the innermost term is 1 + 3, then each subsequent term adds another layer.\n\nBut since we've already computed the value of the innermost expression step by step and confirmed it with the formula, I feel confident that the result is correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and recognize the repeating pattern.\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n3. Use a step-by-step approach to calculate each layer's value.\n4. Optionally, derive a formula to compute the nth layer directly.\n5. Multiply the outermost layer's value by 3 to get the final result.\n6. Verify each step to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis methodical approach helps prevent mistakes and ensures that each part of the expression is handled correctly. It's especially useful for complex expressions with multiple layers of nesting. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by tripling the previous result and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the innermost layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Compute each subsequent layer:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - Final result: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
