    "text": ", but wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, so perhaps breaking it down differently. Alternatively, 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom up: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me verify:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n29524 * 3:\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Layer 9 was 29524, so 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in calculating one of the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple layers, especially with multiplication and addition, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me count how many layers there are in the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then each time you go out, you add another layer.\n\nWait, but in the expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is the last (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each time you go out, you have another (1 + 3*(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, and then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, with nine layers, right? Because each time you have another (1+3(...)), starting from the innermost. So, yes, nine layers, each computed as above.\n\nBut let me make sure that I didn't make an arithmetic error in any of the layers. Let's go through each step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(...), where ... is the nested expression. So, the total number of layers is nine, each time adding another (1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and it's a non-homogeneous one because of the constant term 1.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Because sometimes when you have a recurrence, the indexing can be off by one. Let me confirm that a_n corresponds correctly.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na_2 = 13, which is (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, so a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

    "text": ", so 60000 + 27000 = 87000 Next, 3 * 500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500 Then, 3 * 24 = 72, so adding that to 88500 gives 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the multiplication because 3 * 29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So putting it all together: 88572. Hmm, so that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I get 88572. But let me check if I did all the layers correctly because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all the layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because the number seems quite large. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let's consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n = 9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So that's correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the final answer. But just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 to make sure. 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049. Correct. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recursive formula approach gave me the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers.

I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier result. That's reassuring.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Wait, but let me check each multiplication step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6:1+3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1+29523=29524, correct. Finally, multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let's compute this carefully. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, add them up: 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +72=88572. So, yes, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression has nine layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, does that mean there are nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1? Let me confirm the count. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So, computing up to Layer 9, then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. So, yes, 88572 seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result without computing each layer manually. That's a good way to verify the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4.

Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, 3 * 29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24. Let's compute each part: 3*20000 = 60000 3*9000 = 27000 3*500 = 1500 3*24 = 72 Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, right. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, yes. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, as computed. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way to confirm. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, it's a geometric progression. But in this case, since each term is nested within the previous one, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, but let me check that again because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, so 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72.

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or pattern that I can recognize here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. This looks like a recursive sequence. Let me write down the terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the same result as before. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms the answer.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for the nth term. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.

    "text": ", so 60000 + 27000 = 87000 Next, 3 * 500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500 Then, 3 * 24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572 Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 ones. So, 3*2 = 6 (ten thousands place)\n3*9 = 27 (thousands place)\n3*5 = 15 (hundreds place)\n3*2 = 6 (tens place)\n3*4 = 12 (ones place)\n\nWait, but actually, when multiplying, we need to carry over as necessary. Let's compute it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, the final answer would be 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Sometimes, with these nested expressions, you can find a geometric series or some recursive formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous part: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1\n\nWait, actually, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence, and the solution can be found using the method of finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked each step, used a recursive formula approach, and verified the computations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, and 3 * 24 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake.

Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, as we saw. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is n=1, and the outermost layer is n=9. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same number. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's plug in n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nTo find another equation, let's compute a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNow, plug n=2 into the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, plug A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, and we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by iterative computation and by using the recurrence relation formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": ", but wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, so maybe breaking it down differently would help. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 0*3=0, write down 0. 0*3=0, write down 0. 2*3=6. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next digits: 0 and 0, so 0*3=0 each. So, the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers: Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each next is 1+3(...), so from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly, which was 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about the structure. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can look for a pattern or solve it using standard techniques. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense because each term is multiplied by 3. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2, and then multiply by 3, giving 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step, using the recurrence relation, or finding a closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), so each time there's a (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of such layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But maybe I miscounted the layers because sometimes when you have nested expressions, the count can be tricky.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, each ( is an opening parenthesis, and each ) is a closing one.\n\nStarting from the first ( after 3:\n\n1.

Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 27. So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but earlier when I broke it down, I had 3*29524 = 88572, which matches. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 4, as we saw. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n*a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3 and c=1. So, starting from a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, for n layers, the general formula would be a_n = 3^{n} + (something). Let me see. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we have. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Yep, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think I did that correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach to verify. Sometimes, with nested expressions like this, you can find a pattern or a formula that allows you to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me see if that's possible here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then the entire expression is 3*L9. So, in general, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This looks like a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Then, we find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => Subtract 3A from both sides: -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L(1)=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me more confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to recap, the problem was a deeply nested expression where each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I was able to compute the result without manually expanding each layer, which saved time and reduced the chance of error. Alternatively, manually computing each layer step by step also led me to the same result, so both approaches corroborate each other. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So the final answer would be 88572. But wait, that seems like a very large number, and I'm not sure if I made a mistake in the layers. Let me try computing a few layers again to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThus, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, the original problem is 3*(...), and I computed each layer up to Layer 9, which is the innermost expression. Wait, no, actually, each layer is built from the inside out, so Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So when I compute Layer 9, that's the entire expression inside the outermost 3*(...). So, yes, multiplying 3 by Layer 9 gives the final result. But wait, let me double-check the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). So, starting with 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and the innermost is 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1)\n3. 1 + 3*(2)\n4. 1 + 3*(3)\n5. 1 + 3*(4)\n6. 1 + 3*(5)\n7. 1 + 3*(6)\n8. 1 + 3*(7)\n9. 1 + 3*(8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(9).\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, yes, I computed up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression inside the 3, and then multiplied by 3. So, my calculation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Plus 1 is 3280.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the sequence is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation, which might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's assume that as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate, but in our case, n is finite (n=9), so maybe we can find a pattern. Alternatively, since each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write this as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), where c is a constant to be determined. Let's see: a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c) => a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 2c. But from the original recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, comparing the two, 3*a_{n-1} + 2c = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Therefore, 2c = 1 => c = 1/2. So, we can write a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). Therefore, the sequence b_n = a_n + 1/2 satisfies b_n = 3*b_{n-1}, which is a geometric sequence with ratio 3. So, b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}. Now, b_1 = a_1 + 1/2 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, b_n = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (3^2)/2 * 3^{n-1} = (3^{n+1})/2. Therefore, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": ", but wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to just compute 29524 * 3. Let me do that digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Maybe I should verify each step. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Alternatively, perhaps it's a form of a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent term is built using the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps we can find a formula for a_n. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have a_9, since there are nine layers. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we also get 88572 as the final answer. That confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series, but it's a bit more involved because each term is built upon the previous one. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach it. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, it's like each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That's similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by a common ratio, but here we also add a constant each time. So, it's a linear recurrence, which we've already solved. I think the method we used is the most straightforward, especially since it's a problem with a manageable number of layers\u2014nine layers. If there were more layers, it might be more practical to use the formula. But for nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct, and the formula approach also leads to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me recompute a couple of the layers. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Correct. So, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Let's consider the general form: Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I let a_n be the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 * something? Wait, let me recall. The general solution for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = A*c^n + B, where B is a particular solution. Let's solve it: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Let's find the homogeneous solution: characteristic equation is r = 3, so homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the equation: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, then layer 2 is 1 + 3*4=13, and so on up to layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). So, 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Alternatively, computing directly: 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. That's correct. Now, another test case: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Innermost: 1+3=4. Next layer: 1+3*4=13.

    "text": ", but wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, so I should break it down correctly. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; so reading from the right, it's 8, 7, 8, 2, 8, 6. Wait, let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that again because when I did 3*29524, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make an error. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the multiplication again because sometimes even if the layers are correct, the final multiplication could have an error.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 using another method. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24\n\nSo,\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be represented recursively. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which might make it easier to compute a_9 without having to compute each layer step by step.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nWhere A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nPlugging in the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. So, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, since each term is 1 + 3*(previous), it's similar to expanding a number in base 3, but perhaps that's overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each time we add 1 and multiply by 3. So, expanding the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nIf I expand it fully, it's 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1\n\nWait, but actually, each layer adds another power of 3. Let me see:\n\nWait, when I expand it, the expression becomes:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) = 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 3^9*1\n\nSo, it's a geometric series with first term 3 and ratio 3, for 9 terms.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Let's see:\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers.\n\nBut when I expand E, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms.\n\nWait, but actually, each time you go a layer deeper, you add another multiplication by 3. So, the first term is 3*1, the second term is 3*3*1, the third term is 3*3*3*1, etc., up to nine layers.\n\nSo, E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9\n\nThat's a geometric series with first term a = 3, ratio r = 3, and number of terms n = 9.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nS = 3*(3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3*(19683 - 1)/2 = 3*(19682)/2 = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but that's the sum up to 3^9, but our earlier computation gave a_9 = 29524, which is 29523 +1. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, no, because in the expression E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is 3*(a_9). So, E = 3*a_9, where a_9 is the 9th layer. From earlier, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut when I tried to sum the series as 3 + 3^2 + ... +3^9, I got 29523, which is exactly a_9 -1. Because a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, so 29524 -1 = 29523, which matches the sum of the series.\n\nSo, the sum S = 3 + 3^2 + ... +3^9 = 29523, and then E = 3*(1 + S/3) = 3*(1 + 29523/3) = 3*(1 + 9841) = 3*9842 = 29526, which doesn't make sense because that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the expression E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13, and so on up to a_9 = 29524. Then E = 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to represent E as a sum, it's 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... +3^{10}, but that would be a sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k, which is (3^{11} -3)/ (3 -1) )= (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which matches E.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, E can be expressed as the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k, which equals (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it. Let me confirm:\n\nSum from k=1 to n of 3^k = (3^{n+1} -3)/2\n\nHere, n=10, so sum is (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in summary, whether I compute each layer step by step, solve the recurrence relation, or recognize the expression as a geometric series, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. Each method cross-verifies the result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.

    "text": ", so 60000 + 27000 = 87000 Next, 3 * 500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500 Then, 3 * 24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572 Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have messed up somewhere. Let me compute 3 * 29524 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, okay, that seems correct. But let me make sure that each layer was computed correctly. Let's go through each layer again to check for any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, each layer seems to be computed correctly. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(...), where the innermost is 1+3. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the total number of layers is nine, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, that sounds like a geometric series. Maybe there's a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me recall the formula for a geometric series. A geometric series has the form a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. But in this case, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), which is a bit different. Wait, actually, this is a recurrence relation. Let me define it as such. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The standard approach for such a recurrence is to solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, writing it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": ", so 60000 + 27000 = 87000 Next, 3 * 500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500 Then, 3 * 24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I did 3*29524, I might have broken it down incorrectly. Let me try another way: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify using another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Okay, that's consistent. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the computation. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me write out the terms again: L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Now, I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term minus 2, but let me check: L2=13, which is 3*4 +1=13? Wait, 3*4=12 +1=13. L3=1 +3*13=40. Hmm, maybe it's better to see if there's a closed-form formula for L(n). The recursive relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition: When n=1, L(1)=4= A*3^1 + B=3A + B. Also, since the recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L(n)= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2= (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2= (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1)= (3^(2)-1)/2= (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n)= (3^(n+1)-1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9)= (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the outermost expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute it step by step: 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

    "text": ", but wait, 29524 is 29000 + 524. So maybe it's better to compute 3 * 29524 directly. Alternatively, let me break it down: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit. Let me do that:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, but let me verify once more because sometimes when I do quick calculations, I might make a mistake. Let me add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier. Let me go through each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time we add 1 and then multiply by 3. Wait, actually, it's more like each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, this seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, the innermost term is a_1 = 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThis seems to be a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nIn this case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nThis confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and the formula approach also leads to the same result.

So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. But wait, that feels like a very large number. Let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 8 more layers of 1+3*(...). Wait, no, actually, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then inside that, there's a 1 + 3(...), which is the first layer, then another 1 + 3(...), etc. Let me count how many times 1+3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then, each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then, moving out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1). Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2). And so on, until Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8). So, yes, there are 9 layers, each adding another 3*(previous layer). So, the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, my earlier computation is correct with 9 layers, leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But let me check if I made a mistake in the Layer7 computation. Layer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6). Layer6 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. That's correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. So, 3*9841=29523. Then, Layer9=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or solved using recursion. Let me think about this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recursive relation. We can write it as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A - 1/2 =4 => 3A=4 + 1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer is L9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L9, and L9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is found to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ", so 60000 + 27000 = 87000 Next, 3 * 500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500 Then, 3 * 24 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572 Wait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, let me just go back through each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), but in this case, the recurrence is a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can model it as a linear recurrence. Let me define a_n as the value at each layer, starting from n=1 as the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, starting from the innermost. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers: The innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3. Then each additional layer adds one more. The expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each adding a layer. So, layer 1 up to layer 9. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until we get to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. But in this case, a_0 would be 1, because when n=0, a_0 = 1. Wait, let me check that. If n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. If a_0 is 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, then, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. Then, the solution would be a geometric series: a_n = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... + 3^{n} = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is the same as before. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and 3*a_9 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Okay, that checks out. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify.

Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 =13. a_3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40. a_4=1 +3*a3=1 +120=121. a_5=1 +3*a4=1 +363=364. a_6=1 +3*a5=1 +1092=1093. a_7=1 +3*a6=1 +3279=3280. a_8=1 +3*a7=1 +9840=9841. a_9=1 +3*a8=1 +29523=29524. So, the same as before. So, the expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). So, if we set a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), then a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 2c - c = 3*a_{n-1} + c. Comparing to the original equation, a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*a_{n-1} +1, so c=1. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n +1 =3*(a_{n-1}+1). So, this is a geometric sequence where each term is 3 times the previous term. Therefore, a_n +1 = 3^{n}*(a_1 +1). Wait, a_1=4, so a_1 +1=5. Therefore, a_n +1=5*3^{n-1}. So, a_n=5*3^{n-1} -1. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: a1=5*3^{0}-1=5*1 -1=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=5*3^{1}-1=15-1=14. Wait, but earlier we had a2=13. Hmm, discrepancy here. So, maybe my approach is incorrect. Let me try again. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let's test that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2=(3-1)/2=1. But a1=4, so no. Alternatively, maybe a_n = (4*3^{n} -1)/something. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a1=4. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n =3*a_{n-1}, which has solution a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A =3*A +1 => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3=3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 works. Therefore, for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative method and the formula method give the same result.

Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to follow the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and then finding a particular solution. The homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it more efficiently without having to compute each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only 9 layers, it's manageable either way. Alternatively, I can also think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer adds another factor of 3, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, we're adding another 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me see if I can express this as a sum. Let me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Let me see how many terms there are. Each \"1 + 3*\" is a term, and there are 9 such terms inside the outermost 3. Wait, actually, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))) with 9 layers. Alternatively, using the formula I found earlier, S = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Which confirms the earlier result. So, whether I compute it step by step, using the recurrence relation, or by recognizing the pattern and using the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).
