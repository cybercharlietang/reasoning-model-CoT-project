    "text": " Let's start with the innermost parentheses. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 363 + 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do multiple layers, it's easy to slip up. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, seems consistent. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. If I can express a_n in terms of n, then I can compute the value without having to calculate each layer step by step. The recursion here is linear, so maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form of a linear recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c is 3 and d is 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_0 - d/(1 - c)) * c^n + d/(1 - c). Wait, let me make sure. The standard solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_0 - d/(1 - c)) * c^n + d/(1 - c), provided that c \u2260 1. In our case, a_0 would be the initial term, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. But wait, actually, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, where a_0 is 1? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. Let's define a_1 as the innermost term: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is Layer 2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on up to a_9, which is Layer 9. So, in this case, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => Subtract 3*a_p from both sides: -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, this seems to work. So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives the value of each layer. Therefore, the outermost layer is a_9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to go through each layer. That's much more efficient, especially if the expression were longer. So, to summarize, by recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation, I can find the value much faster. However, since the problem only had nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the general approach for more complex expressions. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the value of each layer efficiently.\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Solve the recurrence relation**: The general solution for \\( a_n \\) is found to be \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute the outermost layer**: For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost expression, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 = 40. Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3 times Layer 3. So, Layer 4 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Moving on to Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*Layer 4 = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5 = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Wait, no. Let me check the original problem again: It's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. Wait, but when I labeled the layers, I considered each Layer n as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 9 is the innermost part, and the expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of parentheses. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So starting from the first one: 1. 3(1 + 3( ... )) 2. Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3( ... )) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first layer is 3 times (1 + 3(...))\n- Inside that, another 3 times (1 + 3(...))\n- Repeating until the innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers of 1 + 3(...) are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nEach time, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1).\n\nContinuing until Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8).\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, in total, we have 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but when I counted earlier, I had Layer 9 as 29524, which was the result of 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, if the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), then the total result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, which was the innermost part? Wait, no, maybe I messed up the layering.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the layers differently. Let me try again.\n\nThe innermost part is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000.\n\n9000*3 = 27000.\n\n500*3 = 1500.\n\n24*3 = 72.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me do it properly.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8.\n\n2 + 2 = 4.\n\n5 + 5 = 10.\n\n9 + 9 = 18.\n\n2 + 2 = 4.\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nThen, adding another 29524: 59048 + 29524.\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048.\n\n79048 + 9000 = 88048.\n\n88048 + 524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that I can apply here. Each layer seems to follow the formula: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A \u2192 9/2 = 3A \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)) with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, n=9 corresponds to Layer 9, which is the innermost part. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, it's 3*a_9, where a_9 is defined as above.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. By working from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step. Each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find that a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each time, it seems like the next layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. Let me check: 3*4 + 1 = 13, yes. Then 3*13 + 1 = 40, correct. So, if I continue this pattern, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That seems to be the case. Let me write down the layers as I compute them:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13\nLayer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 40\nLayer 4: 3*40 + 1 = 121\nLayer 5: 3*121 + 1 = 364\nLayer 6: 3*364 + 1 = 1093\nLayer 7: 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\nLayer 8: 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\nLayer 9: 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, counting them:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer, which is the outermost one. So, Layer 9 would be the entire expression inside the first set of parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So, according to my earlier computation, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no. Wait, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the outermost operation is 3 times the ninth layer. So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524*3. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. But each layer is similar, so maybe I can express E in terms of itself. Wait, but since there are nine layers, it's not infinitely nested, so maybe that approach won't work directly. Alternatively, since I've already found that each layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, and E=3*Layer9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which matches my earlier result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost layer, I computed each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. I noticed a pattern and derived a formula for the nth layer, which allowed me to compute the 9th layer directly. Then, I multiplied that result by 3 to get the final value. I also verified the formula by plugging in known values and ensuring consistency. Additionally, I considered an alternative approach using the closed-form expression for the entire nested expression, which also led me to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting with the innermost layer as 1 + 3. By iteratively applying this pattern, each subsequent layer is computed until reaching the outermost layer. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. Using a derived formula, the computation is confirmed to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost parentheses first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, it's growing quickly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, so each time, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This seems like a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula here. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's see. The recurrence is Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. First, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is Layer n = 3*(Layer n-1), which has the solution Layer n = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Layer n = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. What is the initial condition? Let's see. The innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. So, when n=1, Layer 1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, that can be written as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, the original problem has nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. So, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. First, verifying the general formula: Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: (27 -1)/2 =13, correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=40, correct. So, the formula seems solid. Then, Layer 9: (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524*3=88572. Correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer step by step without using the formula, just to confirm. Let's do that quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. I think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the innermost parentheses first and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, each layer n is found to be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, that's getting bigger. Let's go to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 360+3=363. Then, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Wait, no. Let me check the original problem again. It's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)). So, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). But wait, in my earlier breakdown, I had Layer 9 as the outermost. Wait, actually, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which we just computed as 29524. So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12.

Wait, that's only 5 digits, so the result should be 88572. Wait, but when I did it digit by digit, I think I went too far. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 *3=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n5*3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each layer built upon the previous one correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.

    "text": " Maybe I can start by evaluating the innermost expression first. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's easy. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving outward, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, adding 1 gives us 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay. Let's see Layer 4. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives 363 + 1 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Sometimes when I do a lot of steps, it's easy to slip up. Let me verify each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, all the layers seem to check out. Each step follows logically, and the multiplications and additions seem correct. I think I did this right. So, yeah, the final answer is 88572.

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let's do a few more layers to see if I can spot a pattern or a formula. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. So, putting it all together, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. Let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check each multiplication step again to be thorough. Layer 2: 3*4=12, 1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 3*13=39, 1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 3*40=120, 1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 3*121=363, 1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841=29523, 1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that all checks out. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recursive formula is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Wait, actually, L1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, as we computed. So, the recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, it's (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to write the entire expression in terms of the formula, the outermost Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to look at it, confirming the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\) where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\\[ L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\]\nwith \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280). Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

    "text": " Maybe if I write each layer as a function of the previous one, it'll help. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., up to L9. So, starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's simple enough. Now, L2 is 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, then L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on. L3 would be 1 + 3*(L2). L2 is 13, so L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me keep going. L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, this is growing rapidly. L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of all those layers. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that matches what I had before. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors in my calculations. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed each layer step by step up to the ninth layer, which gave me 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final answer, 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is a geometric progression of sorts, where each term is built upon the previous one with a factor of 3. It's interesting how quickly the numbers grow. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let's see: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, moving one layer out, we have Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Therefore, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a second, but the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me calculate 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify 29524 * 3 once again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, and then multiplying the final result by 3, I arrive at the answer 88572. I think that's the correct solution.

    "text": " Maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. So, the innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let's see if this continues. Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total value is 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication gives 88572.

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost expression and work our way out. So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, if I can find a formula or a pattern, maybe I can compute all the layers without having to do each multiplication step by step. But since there are only nine layers, maybe it's manageable. Let me try to compute each layer one by one. Layer 1: 4 (as above). Layer 2: 13. Layer 3: 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the problem is asking for 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Wait, no, that might be overcomplicating it. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3 * Layer 7. So, 1 + 3 * 3280. Calculating 3 * 3280: 3000 * 3 is 9000, 200 * 3 is 600, 80 * 3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3 * Layer 8. That's 1 + 3 * 9841. Let me compute 3 * 9841. Hmm, 9000 * 3 is 27000, 800 * 3 is 2400, 40 * 3 is 120, and 1 * 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, that's 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 is 60000, 9000 * 3 is 27000, 500 * 3 is 1500, 20 * 3 is 60, and 4 * 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.

So, it's a geometric progression of sorts, but each term is built by 1 + 3*(previous term). I remember that such expressions can sometimes be solved using a formula, but since I might not remember the exact formula, it's safer to compute each layer step by step to avoid mistakes. Alternatively, I could think of it as a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Then, the sequence would be a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, and so on, up to a_9=29524.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me start with the innermost expression, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving outward, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Since Layer 2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.

Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, we have 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, actually, perhaps it's easier to compute 29524*3 directly. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. It's easy to make a mistake with all these layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me check 3*364 again: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1092 + 1 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. 27000 + 2523=29523. 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that again: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n...\nHow many times does \"1+3(...)\" occur? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of \"1+3(\" is 9 times. So, there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think I did 9 layers correctly, from Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I started, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, which is correct. So, each layer is built upon the previous one. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern that can be generalized, but given that it's only 9 layers, computing each step is feasible. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLet me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, as we found earlier.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute each layer directly without having to compute each step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, both methods work.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThus, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. Each step follows logically, and both the step-by-step computation and the general formula approach yield the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1.

Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Each step involves multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1, which is a linear recurrence relation. It might be possible to find a formula for such a recurrence, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, and then computing up to a_9. But in this case, since the number of layers isn't too large, step-by-step computation is feasible. I don't think I made any arithmetic errors, but just to be thorough, let me recheck a few steps. For example, Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's do it another way. 29524 * 3. 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's digit-wise multiplication, but it's easier to compute as I did before. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

So, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, and then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.

Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me check the multiplication again for Layer 9: 9841 * 3. 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. Wait, actually, when multiplying 9841 by 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12 (write down 2, carry over 1), 8*3=24 +1=25 (write down 5, carry over 2), 9*3=27 +2=29. So, 9841*3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 29524*3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6 +1=7, 5*3=15, 9*3=27 +1=28, 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.

Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841, let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering the number of layers, it might be correct. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculation is right.

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost part, which is the last parentheses before the first closing one. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving another layer out, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each layer seems to be 3 times the previous layer plus 1. Let me see if this pattern continues. Layer 5 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me check if I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Each time, I computed Layer n as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Starting from Layer 1: 4, then Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, the outermost 3 times that: 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a sequence. Let\u2019s define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Let me compute a_9 first. a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm once more because sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to miscount the layers. The original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...). So, a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, a_9 is indeed (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can compute 3*(a_9) using the formula: 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we can compute the value step by step. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe if I compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost, and work my way outwards, I can avoid getting confused with all the parentheses. Let me start with the innermost expression, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer 2. So, 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 = 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3. That would be 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5 = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Layer 6 = 1,093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6 = 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3 = 3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Layer 7 = 3,280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7 = 1 + 3*3,280. Let's calculate 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000, 280*3=840, so 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Layer 8 = 9,841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 3*9,841. Hmm, 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Layer 9 = 29,524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29,524. Let me compute that: 29,524*3. Let's break it down: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.

That seems right. I don't see any errors in my step-by-step calculations. So, I think that's the correct answer. I guess the key here was to break down each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part, and then working my way outward. Each time, I just needed to compute the current layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it step by step made it manageable. I was worried at first that I might get lost in the parentheses, but by labeling each layer, it became systematic. I hope I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes, but each step seems to check out. Yeah, I think 88,572 is the right answer. Maybe I can write it as 88,572 or 88572 without the comma for the final answer. Let me just confirm once more: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1,093, Layer7:3,280, Layer8:9,841, Layer9:29,524. Then, 3*29,524: 29,524*3 is indeed 88,572.

So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: that's 39. So, 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Well, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original problem is 3*(...), where the ... is all those layers. So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, we need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. It's easy to slip up with such large numbers. Let me verify each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me consider the general form. Let's say we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Solving for C: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me recount. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Wait, actually, when I numbered the layers earlier, I started from the innermost as Layer 1, which was 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer added another 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9 in our formula. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, using the closed-form solution, we can compute the value without having to calculate each layer step by step, which is much more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers. But in this problem, since it's only nine layers, both methods work. However, knowing the formula is helpful because it can save time and reduce the chance of arithmetic errors. Let me just confirm that 3^10 is indeed 59049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, a_9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. To recap, by breaking down the expression layer by layer and then finding a closed-form formula for each layer, I arrived at the solution. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to solve it more efficiently. I guess practice helps in seeing these patterns more quickly. But even without knowing the formula, computing each layer step by step works, though it's more time-consuming. Anyway, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing this pattern, we can model it using a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\\[ a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\]\nwith the initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\nThe closed-form solution for this recurrence is:\n\\[ a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor the innermost layer (Layer 1):\n\\[ a_1 = \\frac{3^{2} - 1}{2} = 4 \\]\n\nFor the outermost layer (Layer 9):\n\\[ a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let's define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 is the innermost: L1 = 1 + 3 Then, L2 is 1 + 3*L1, L3 is 1 + 3*L2, and so on until L9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Hmm, maybe I should compute each layer step by step, starting from L1 and moving outward. Let me write this down:\n\nCompute L1 = 1 + 3\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n...\nUp to L9, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nYes, that seems manageable. Let me start computing each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with L1:\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. Now, L2 is 1 + 3*L1, which is 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute 3*4 = 12, so L2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nMoving on to L3:\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so L3 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so L4 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so L5 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. So, L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. So, L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. So, L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nNow, 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Therefore, L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check that multiplication because 3*9841 is actually 3*(9000 + 841) = 27000 + 2523 = 29523, yes. So, L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*24=72\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7\n\n5 *3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me do it another way to confirm.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) *3\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again quickly to check for errors.\n\nL1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2:1 +3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula that represents this expression.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 13\n\nL3 = 40\n\nL4 = 121\n\nL5 = 364\n\nL6 = 1093\n\nL7 = 3280\n\nL8 = 9841\n\nL9 = 29524\n\nWait, each L_n seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me see:\n\nEach L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWhich is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me try to model this.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1=4.\n\nWhen n=1, L1=4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2\n\nSo, 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which is the same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me verify 3^{11} is indeed 177147.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and the formula approach confirms the result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, we compute the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 + 3 times the next inner term. There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Formula**: Recognize the recurrence relation and derive the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me start from the innermost parentheses and move outward. Starting with the innermost Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, seems like the numbers are growing quickly. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29,000 is 87,000, and 3*524 is 1,572. So, adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, is the answer 88,572? Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. That seems consistent. But let me check each multiplication step again to be sure. Layer 1: 4. Correct. Layer 2: 3*4=12, plus 1 is 13. Correct. Layer 3: 3*13=39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 3*40=120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364=1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093=3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524*3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another. Let me count the number of times I computed layers: 1 to 9, so that's nine layers. So, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is then multiplied by 3. So, yes, 3*(Layer 9) is correct. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since the numbers are manageable and the layers are only nine, computing each step is feasible. If there were more layers, I might look for a formula, but in this case, step-by-step computation seems efficient. I think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. Just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88,572. Yep, that's consistent every time. So, I think I can confidently say that the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again.\n\nWait, 3*29524 is the same as 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n________\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down into parts, I had:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check each layer again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me go through each layer once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12; total 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279; total 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840; total 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523; total 27000+2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL(3) = 1 + 3*L(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L(9).\n\nSo, in general, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolve for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1)=4.\n\nL(1) = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n\nWait, but maybe I can check this with smaller n to see if the formula works.\n\nFor example, when n=1, L(1)=4.\n\nUsing the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2)=13.\n\nFormula: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L(3)=40.\n\nFormula: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L(4)=121.\n\nFormula: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L(5)=364.\n\nFormula: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L(6)=1093.\n\nFormula: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L(7)=3280.\n\nFormula: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L(8)=9841.\n\nFormula: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L(9)=29524.\n\nFormula: (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all these cases. Therefore, using the formula is a much quicker way to compute L(n) without having to compute each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm it's 59049.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. Both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the pattern and deriving a formula for the nth layer, I was able to compute the value without manually calculating each layer, which would have been time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L(n) = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), this gives \\( L(9) = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, which is the innermost part of the original expression.

Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time after the first 3, there's a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) sections. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n   - So, starting from the left, the first term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Then inside that, another 3*(1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let's count how many layers there are. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let's see: 1. 3(1 + 3(...)) 2. Then inside, 1 + 3(...) 3. Then another 1 + 3(...) 4. Another 1 + 3(...) 5. Another 1 + 3(...) 6. Another 1 + 3(...) 7. Another 1 + 3(...) 8. Another 1 + 3(...) 9. The innermost one is 1 + 3. So, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...) inside each other, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3. Wait, no. Let me check again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). So, starting from the left, it's 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, how many times does this nesting happen? Let's see:\n\n- The first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n- The second layer is inside that: 1 + 3*(...)\n- This continues until the ninth layer, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and the entire expression is 3*(...). Wait, actually, the first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is layer 9, and then each layer wraps around that. So, maybe I should compute from layer 9 inward. Let me try that.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 1). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1), which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.

So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long calculation. Let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for C and D. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88,572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods gave me the same result, which is reassuring.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a recurrence relation and verifying with a closed-form formula, we determine that the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let's do Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364.

Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that. 3*29524.

So, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092.

So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Calculating 3*13 gives 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092.

Let me calculate that. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, but maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should do it digit by digit:\n\n3\n\u00d729524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8, carry over 0.\nFinally, the 2 at the beginning: 2\u00d73=6, write down 6.\n\nWait, that gives me 68572? Wait, that doesn't match what I thought earlier. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it out properly:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\n\u00d7         3\n------------\nStarting from the units place:\n4\u00d73=12: write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7: write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext: 5\u00d73=15: write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28: write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8: write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, but when I did it digit by digit above, I thought it was 68572, but that must have been a miscalculation. So 29524 \u00d73 is indeed 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 \u00d73. Let's break it down: 29,524 \u00d73. 20,000\u00d73=60,000. 9,000\u00d73=27,000. 500\u00d73=1,500. 24\u00d73=72. Now, adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 +72=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3\u00d729,524=88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2:1+3\u00d74=13. Layer 3:1+3\u00d713=40. Layer 4:1+3\u00d740=121. Layer 5:1+3\u00d7121=364. Layer 6:1+3\u00d7364=1093. Layer 7:1+3\u00d71093=3280. Layer 8:1+3\u00d73280=9841. Layer 9:1+3\u00d79841=29524. Then, 3\u00d729524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach. Let me check if there's a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirmed the result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula for the nth layer, confirming our step-by-step results. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, but actually, looking back at the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(something). Let me check: The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and the entire expression is 3*(the last layer). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Let me write down each layer and compute its value step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2:\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3:\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4:\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5:\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6:\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7:\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8:\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9:\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's do this multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\nThen, 3 * 9000 = 27000\n3 * 500 = 1500\n3 * 20 = 60\n3 * 4 = 12\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the computation of 3*29524.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 =7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 =27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which could help verify the result. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then the expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nBut let's solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 =4.\n\na_1 = C*3^{1} -1/2 =3C -1/2=4\n\nSo, 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponentiation. Let me compute 3^10 again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^10=59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider the entire expression as follows.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as x_1=1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving outward, x_2=1+3*x_1=1+12=13.\n\nx_3=1+3*x_2=1+39=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to x_9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*x_9.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the exponents. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, and there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nWait, but the formula I derived earlier gives a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, as we saw.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's think about it.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to building a geometric series.\n\nWait, let's try to expand the expression.\n\nLet me write down the entire expression step by step.\n\nStart from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(Layer 1)=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*(Layer 2)=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*(Layer3)=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*(Layer4)=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*(Layer5)=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*(Layer6)=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*(Layer7)=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*(Layer8)=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression as follows.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to write this as E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express E in terms of itself, but that might not be straightforward because each layer is similar but not the same as the entire expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think recursively. Let me define E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1=3*(1 +3)=3*4=12.\n\nE_2=3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39.\n\nE_3=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*13)=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem to align with our earlier computation. Wait, no, in our earlier step-by-step, Layer 1 was 4, Layer 2 was 13, Layer3 was40, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps E_n=3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), but no, because each layer is 1 +3*previous_layer, not 1 +3*E_{n-1}.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the original expression, each layer is 1 +3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, each subsequent layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, perhaps E_n=1 +3*E_{n-1}, but that might not capture the entire expression correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since I've already computed each layer step by step and verified it with the formula, and both methods give me the same result, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n3*29524:\n\nFirst, 29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer up to the ninth layer, which results in 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, interesting. Layer 4 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wait a minute, that's 121. Let me check my calculations so far: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me compute a few more layers to see if I can find a pattern or a formula that might help me jump to the outer layers without computing each one individually. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5)/2 -1/2=243/2 -1/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. So, by breaking down each layer, computing step by step, and then verifying with a recurrence relation, I arrived at the solution. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, just to verify. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, but actually, in my earlier computation, L_1 was 4, L_2 was 13, etc. But perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula for L_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, that's a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's substitute the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) = A*3^{n}, and 3*B. So, right side becomes A*3^{n} + 3B + 1. Therefore, equation: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but in our case, all layers have integer values. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is different. Wait, perhaps the particular solution is a constant. Let me try that again. Let me assume that the particular solution is a constant, say C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression, considering that it's 3*(L_9). Let me see: The expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Because 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*1 = 3. So, (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the step-by-step computation. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding them up:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYep, same result. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach led me to the same answer. So, I think that's the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I should compute Layer 1 first, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on. Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 equals 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\nNext, 3*500 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\nThen, 3*20 = 60, so 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\nWait, but that's only up to 3*29520. Hmm, maybe I should do it more carefully.\n\nWait, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n= 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier layers again because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093:\n\n1000*3 = 3000\n\n90*3 = 270\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nSo, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280:\n\n3000*3 = 9000\n\n280*3 = 840\n\nSo, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer? Because computing each layer step by step might be time-consuming, especially if there are more layers. Maybe there's a formula or a geometric series involved here.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI recall that for such linear recurrence relations, there's a closed-form solution. Let me try to find a pattern or derive a formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of the innermost layer, which is a_9, is indeed 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the formula.\n\nThe formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, 3^{10} is indeed 59049.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this multiplication once more to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the standard multiplication:\n\n   29524\n*      3\n---------\n   88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe denote each layer as \\(a_n\\), where \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\).

Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Then, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Wait, that might not be the best way to break it down. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then using that result in the next layer. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, did I count the layers correctly? Let me check. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, the expression is 3(...), and inside that, there are 8 more layers, because each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Wait, actually, let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that, so starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers because each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Wait, but when I computed, I went up to Layer 9 and then multiplied by 3, so maybe that's correct. Let me recount. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time you have a 1+3(, that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...), so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: The first 3 is outside, then inside it, we have 1+3(...), which is Layer 1. Then inside that, another 1+3(...), which is Layer 2, and so on, until we have 9 layers in total. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct, and then multiplied by the initial 3. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically, and I don't see any arithmetic errors.

    "text": " Maybe I can compute the innermost part first. So, starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is... let's see, 364*3. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093. Hmm, let me compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, actually, maybe breaking it down differently would be better. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 4*3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 9*3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit from right to left.\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the total value is 88572. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again just to be sure. Maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 another way.\n\n29524 * 3: Break it down into 29000 + 524. 29000 * 3 is 87000. 524 * 3 is 1572. Now, add 87000 + 1572. 87000 + 1000 is 88000, plus 572 is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Let me just make sure that I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Each layer seems to be correctly calculated based on the previous one. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to approach this problem might be to recognize a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works for the first few layers. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost layer, leading to the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost Multiplication:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
