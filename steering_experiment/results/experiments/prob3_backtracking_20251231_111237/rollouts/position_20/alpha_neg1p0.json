    "text": " Let me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where each Lk is 1 + 3*(L(k-1)). Let's compute them one by one.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer, which is Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3. That's easy. 1 + 3 is 4. So, L1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, L2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(L2). L2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, L3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(L3). L3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. 1 + 120 is 121. So, L4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(L4). L4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. 1 + 363 is 364. So, L5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(L5). L5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, L6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(L6). L6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, L7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(L7). L7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, L8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(L8). L8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, L9 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times (L9). Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing the innermost layers up to L9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 29524 times 3. Let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off. Let me check again. Maybe I should write it out properly.\n\nWait, 29,524 is the number. Let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88,572. Hmm, that seems high, but let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, and then subtract (30,000 - 29,524) which is 476. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Maybe I miscounted the layers or miscalculated one of the Lk values. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, L9 is indeed 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form Lk = 1 + 3*L(k-1). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for Lk.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is Lk = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me check that. The recurrence is Lk = 1 + 3*L(k-1). So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be Lk^h = C*3^k, where C is a constant. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Lk^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Lk = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When k=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Lk = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^(k+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Lk = (3^(k+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct.\n\nFor k=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as L1=4.\n\nFor k=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as L2=13.\n\nFor k=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct, as L3=40.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, Lk = (3^(k+1) -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, L9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute 3^10 again to confirm. Let's compute 3^10 step by step:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59,049.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, let me compute 29,524 * 3 again.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer. So, if I let the innermost term be 1 + 3, and each outer term adds another 1 + 3*... So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the case here because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, which is more like a linear recurrence than a simple geometric series. But maybe I can express it as a sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^2 + 1\n\nWait, 3^2 is 9, plus 1 is 10, but L2 is 13. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121,...\n\nHmm, 4 is 3 + 1, 13 is 3^2 + 4, but that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Since each Lk = 1 + 3*L(k-1), and we've established that Lk = (3^(k+1) -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*(3^10 -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10 is 59,049, so 3^11 is 177,147.\n\nSo, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, using this approach, we get the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by recognizing it as a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nWait, but let's see. Let me consider the expression:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nLet me denote the innermost part as S = 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*S, and so on. Each time, we're adding a 1 and multiplying by 3. So, after n layers, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, perhaps E can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nBut in reality, each layer is a term in a geometric sequence. Let me try to express E in terms of a geometric series.\n\nWait, so E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1's. Each time we have a 1, and each layer adds another 1. Since there are nine layers, I think there are nine 1's. Wait, no, actually, each layer is a 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, the number of 1's is equal to the number of layers, which is nine. So, maybe E can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 1's.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to see it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to expand it.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with the previous methods. So, regardless of the approach, the result is the same.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88,572. I've checked it multiple times using different methods: step-by-step computation, using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation, and verifying with a geometric series approach. All methods lead to the same result.\n\nJust to make absolutely sure, let me compute 3^10 again and then compute E as (3^11 - 3)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59,049, as computed earlier. So, 3^11 is 59,049 * 3 = 177,147.\n\nThen, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer, verifying with a recurrence relation, and checking with a geometric series approach, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_k \\) as follows:\n\\[ L_k = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_{k-1} \\]\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\cdot L_9 \\):\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me write down each layer and compute its value step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1).

So, we compute that: 3*(29524) = 88572 Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right, but let me verify with a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which corresponds to n=9. So, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Using the formula, L(9)=29524, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just make sure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors when computing 3*29524. 29524*3: 29524*3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Correct. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value of the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But hold on, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that. Let me compute that:\n\nTotal = 3 * 29524.\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. 3 * 29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3: \n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me just check the multiplication again:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 as:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3 = (30,000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12, carry 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15, carry 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 9 = 27 + 1 = 28, carry 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me recount the layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1+3, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is the first layer.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have 1+3(...\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is the first.\n\nThen each time, moving outward, each 1+3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, each subsequent ( is a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, so starting from the first 3(, then each 1+3( adds another layer. Wait, but the innermost is 1+3, so how does that count?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Each time I have a 1+3(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then the next layer is 1+3*(Layer1), which is Layer2. Then Layer3 is 1+3*(Layer2), and so on, until Layer9, which is the outermost 1+3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(Layer9). So, my initial approach was correct with 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I see that there are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, 9 layers of 1+3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, my computation of 9 layers leading up to Layer9 being 29,524, and then 3 times that is 88,572, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))), with n layers.\n\nIn this case, n is 9. So, maybe I can find a formula for the nth layer.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. So, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for Layer9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since in this problem n=9, it's manageable to compute each layer step by step as I did earlier.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with 9 layers of 1+3*(...), each layer building on the previous one.\n\n- By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I arrived at the value of the outermost layer being 29,524.\n\n- Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n- Additionally, by solving the recurrence relation, I found a general formula for the nth layer, which for n=9 gives the same result, confirming the correctness.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe can break this down by computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Let's denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 \\) is the innermost layer.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me start by computing the innermost part, which is the last parentheses: 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nThen, 2*3=6 +1=7.\nThen, 5*3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nThen, 9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nThen, 2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n88572\n\nYes, because 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first started, I thought each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer), but I just realized that the expression starts with 3*(...), so actually, the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer is 1 + 3*(...), and finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each time, the expression is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric progression.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572. So, everything checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series with each term being multiplied by 3 each time. Let's see: The innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, it's a geometric progression where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times the last term, which is 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I can also compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula, just to ensure that I didn't make a mistake in the formula approach. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 =13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 =40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) =1 +120=121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121)=1 + 363=364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364)=1 + 1092=1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093)=1 + 3279=3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280)=1 +9840=9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841)=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 20000*3=60000.\n\nCompute 9000*3=27000.\n\nCompute 500*3=1500.\n\nCompute 20*3=60.\n\nCompute 4*3=12.\n\nNow, add them all together: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the standard multiplication method:\n\n    29524\n  x      3\n  --------\n    88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step and using two different methods (step-by-step expansion and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series), I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested part. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, so 3*29524 = 88572. Is that correct? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that matches. So, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds for all layers up to n=9. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let's compute that:\n\n3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nThis confirms that the value is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and even double-checked using a different method. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\\). Solving this recurrence, we derive a closed-form formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this formula for the 9th layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me write each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, and compute each step by step. So, starting with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(L1). So, substituting L1, that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, L2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(L2). So, substituting L2, that's 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, L3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So, L4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. So, L5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, L6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, L7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, L8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, L9 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing L9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the right breakdown. Let me think again. 29524 can be broken into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8.\nSo, putting it together, we get 88572. Yep, that matches my previous calculation. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I didn't skip any layers. The original expression had nine layers of (1 + 3(...)), right? So, L1 through L9. So, each step I computed correctly, starting from L1 up to L9, then multiplied by 3. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miss any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the original problem had exactly nine layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see nine sets of (1+3(...)), so yes, that's nine layers. So, my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer seems to follow the pattern: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recursive relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut since I was able to compute it step by step, and both methods agree, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, in summary, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I arrived at the value of the innermost layer, then worked my way out, multiplying by 3 at the end. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to find a closed-form expression, which confirmed the result.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm pretty sure that the result is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   \\[\n   L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let's start with the innermost parentheses.\n\nInnermost layer (Layer 1): 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 first. 9841 times 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, it's a bit different. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I compute a_9, multiply by 3, that should give me the result. Let me compute a_9 step by step using the recurrence relation. a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = 1.5*3^n - 0.5. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = 1.5*3^1 - 0.5 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4. Correct. n=2: 1.5*9 - 0.5 = 13.5 - 0.5 =13. Correct. n=3:1.5*27 - 0.5=40.5 -0.5=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify that: For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the result is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving out one layer, we have:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121. Next:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Let me compute that. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364. Continuing:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me break that down. 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093. Moving out another layer:\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280. Next layer:\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: Let's calculate. 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841: Hmm, let me compute that. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on a second. I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check the calculation for 3*9841. Maybe I should do it more carefully.\n\n9841 * 3:\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 800 * 3 = 2400\n- 40 * 3 = 120\n- 1 * 3 = 3\nAdding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, yes, 3*9841 is indeed 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nWait, but I just realized that Layer 9 is actually the innermost expression, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, actually, I think I went one layer too deep. Let me recount the layers.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first layer is 1+3(...). Each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the string: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- After the first 3(, we have 1+3(...\n- Then another 1+3(...\n- And so on until the last one, which is 1+3))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and each closing parenthesis ends a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to see how many times the pattern \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me write it out:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until we have nine layers? Wait, the original problem has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's nine \"1+3(\" sequences. So, does that mean there are nine layers? Hmm, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again, starting from the innermost.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000*3 = 60000\n- 9000*3 = 27000\n- 500*3 = 1500\n- 20*3 = 60\n- 4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems quite large. Let me verify the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000*3 = 60000\n- 9000*3 = 27000\n- 500*3 = 1500\n- 20*3 = 60\n- 4*3 = 12\n\nAdding up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait a second, but when I first started, I thought Layer 9 was the innermost, but now I'm seeing that the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps I was correct in my initial approach, but I just wanted to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^n - 1) + (a_1 - c/(r - 1))*(r^{n-1})\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation. For the recurrence a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the closed-form solution is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, maybe I should check that.\n\nActually, the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, with a_0 given. The solution is a_n = r^n*a_0 + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nIn our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. So, if we take a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which fits the formula.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_n = 3^n*a_0 + 1*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1)\n\nSince a_0 = 1, this becomes a_n = 3^n*1 + (3^n - 1)/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, using the closed-form formula, we can compute a_9 as 29524, which matches our earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula, let me go through it again.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation is indeed a_n = C*r^n + d, where r is the root of the homogeneous equation and d is a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say d.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: d = 1 + 3*d\n\nSolving for d: d - 3*d = 1 => -2*d = 1 => d = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWhich is the same as before. So, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2 4\n\nWait, that seems conflicting with the earlier result. Wait, no, let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\nLet's multiply each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (from 2*3+2), then 7 (from 9*3), then 7 (from 5*3+1), then 5 (from 2*3+1), then 7 (from 2*3+1), then 2 (from 4*3). Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it as:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    *       3\n    -----------\n      8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, that's 88572, which is the same as before. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to a geometric series. But in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit different. However, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form formula was more straightforward.\n\nI think I've double-checked all my steps, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Layer 4 is 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression would be 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do that step by step. 29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because sometimes I make mistakes with larger numbers.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Let's break down 29,524 into 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step, just to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's do this carefully. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Now, add them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then the entire expression is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a better way to approach this problem, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually? Because computing each layer step by step might be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially if the number of layers increases.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw earlier.\n\nWait, but actually, in our problem, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the opening parentheses in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 1+3(1+3(...\n3. 1+3(1+3(...\n4. 1+3(1+3(...\n5. 1+3(1+3(...\n6. 1+3(1+3(...\n7. 1+3(1+3(...\n8. 1+3(1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, but actually, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, but the innermost one is just \"1+3)\", so maybe there are 9 layers. Let me count the number of closing parentheses as well. Alternatively, perhaps it's 8 layers. Wait, maybe I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression again:\n\nStarting from the outside:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...) parts. Each \"3(...)\" is a layer, so starting from the outermost, each time we have 3*(...), that's a new layer.\n\nSo, starting with the outermost 3*(...), that's layer 1.\n\nInside that, we have another 3*(...), that's layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost part, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write them out:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time I go in, it's another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3*.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nFrom the outside:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting with 3*(...), then inside that, another 3*(...), and so on, until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many times does 3* occur? Let me count:\n\n1. The outermost 3*(...): 1\n2. Inside that: 3*(...): 2\n3. Inside that: 3*(...): 3\n4. Inside that: 3*(...): 4\n5. Inside that: 3*(...): 5\n6. Inside that: 3*(...): 6\n7. Inside that: 3*(...): 7\n8. Inside that: 3*(...): 8\n9. Inside that: 1 + 3 (no more 3* after this)\n\nWait, so that would be 8 layers of 3*(...), each containing another layer, and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by considering 9 layers. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(...) parts.\n\nStarting from the outside:\n\n- The first 3*(...) is the outermost, that's layer 1.\n\n- Inside that, we have another 3*(...), that's layer 2.\n\n- Continuing, each time we enter another 3*(...), that's a new layer.\n\nSo, how many times does 3*(...) occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3*.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of opening parentheses in the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses '(':\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. After the first 3: 3(...\n2. Then each subsequent 3( adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nSo, let's count:\n\n1. 3(...\n2. 3(...\n3. 3(...\n4. 3(...\n5. 3(...\n6. 3(...\n7. 3(...\n8. 3(...\n9. 3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a 3*(...) term.\n\nBut when I look at the expression, the innermost part is 1+3, which doesn't have another 3*(...), so perhaps the number of layers is 8.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(...) terms.\n\nEach time I see a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis, that's a new layer.\n\nSo:\n\n1. The outermost 3*(...)\n2. Inside that, another 3*(...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many times does 3*(...) occur?\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n9. 3*(1 + 3)\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1 + 3, not 3*(...), so perhaps the number of 3*(...) layers is 8.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see how many times 3*(...) is present.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time after the first 3, there are 8 more 3*(...) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of layers is 8, not 9, because the innermost is just 1 + 3, without another 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3*(...), each time we have another 3*(...) until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, each 3*(...) is a layer, and the innermost is 1 + 3, which doesn't have another 3*(...).\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(...) terms.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The first 3*(...) is layer 1.\n\n- Inside that, another 3*(...) is layer 2.\n\n- Continuing, each time we enter another 3*(...), that's a new layer.\n\nSo, how many 3*(...) terms are there?\n\nStarting from the first 3*(...), each subsequent 3*(...) is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(...) terms:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n9. 3*(1 + 3)\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, but the innermost is 1 + 3, so perhaps the number of layers is 8, with the innermost being 1 + 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each 3*(...) is a layer, so if I have 8 layers, each with a 3*(...), then the innermost is 1 + 3, and the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, maybe the number of layers is 8, so a_8 would be the innermost layer, and then we'd have 3*a_8.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to a_9, I got 29,524, which when multiplied by 3 gave 88,572. But if the number of layers is 8, then perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier computation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recount the layers.\n\nLet me try to write the expression with each layer labeled:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2))\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers, with Layer 9 being the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, so that would mean that the outermost layer is Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)), and Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3), etc., down to Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, in that case, the total number of layers is 9, with each layer from 1 to 9. So, in that case, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 2), where Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3), and so on until Layer 9.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent with the way I defined the layers earlier. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of each 3*(...) as a layer, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, the next layer is Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1).\n\nThen Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8).\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, that makes sense because the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought there were 8 layers, I might have confused the count. It's clear now that there are 9 layers, with Layer 9 being the innermost, and the entire expression being 3 times Layer 9.\n\nSo, with that, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try to compute the entire expression step by step again, but this time, I'll write each layer with its corresponding value.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nEntire expression: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the layer number.\n\nSince the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be sure that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2} = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 3} = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 4} = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 5} = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 6} = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 7} = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8} = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\\[ 3 \\times \\text{Layer 9} = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So that's 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40.\n\nCompute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121.\n\nCompute: 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\nCompute: 3*364. Let me calculate that: 364 * 3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 3*364 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute 3*1093. Let's see, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.

So Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841. Let me break that down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 times the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, did I count the layers correctly? Let me check again because I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and the outermost is multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). Let's count how many times that happens. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then each layer wraps around that with another (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 9 layers inside, each computed step by step.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me verify each layer step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check each multiplication step again to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. Plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Compute that: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute 29524*3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me just check if I've miscounted the layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the initial 3(...). Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each subsequent (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first (1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent (1+3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n10. 1+3...\n\nWait, but actually, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nAfter the first 3(, there are 8 more (1+3(...)) instances, but each time it's nested. Wait, perhaps it's better to see how many times we have a 1+3( inside.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" after the first one is a new layer, so let's count:\n\n1. The first (1+3 is Layer 1\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3 is Layer 2\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1+3\n\nSo, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...):\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is Layer 1. Then inside that, another (1+3(...)) which is Layer 2, and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n10. 1+3...\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the first 3, the first (1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent (1+3 adds another layer. So, starting from Layer 1, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost (1+3), working outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of layers:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n\nThen each step out adds a layer. Let me count how many times 1 + 3*(...) occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo that's 9 layers inside, each computed step by step, then multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nSo, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nWait, but when I counted the opening parentheses, I thought there were 9 layers, but when I tried to count the number of \"1+3(\" instances, I might have miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first ( is Layer 1.\n\nThen inside that, another ( is Layer 2.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3...\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. So that would mean 9 layers. But in my initial calculation, I only went up to Layer 9, which is correct. So, I think my calculation is accurate.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of closing parentheses as well to ensure that the structure is correct.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis should have a corresponding closing one. Let's count the number of closing parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nBut perhaps that's unnecessary since the structure seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize this pattern as a geometric series or some recursive formula. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant.\n\nLet me find the particular solution. The homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, the layers go up to n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I computed earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 is correct for each layer. For n=1, a_1 should be 4. Let's check:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Which matches Layer 2.\n\na_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula holds, which confirms that my earlier calculations were correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Next, L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting big. Let's keep going: L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing L9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1 =59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, L9=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm the result efficiently. The final computation yields:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3*29524. Hmm, let me compute that. 3 times 29,000 is 87,000. 3 times 524 is 1,572. Adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. So, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake here. Let me verify each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, with nine layers, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or a formula. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation looks like L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me check that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Hmm, actually, the standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a=3, b=1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it's correct.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^1 is 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute L_9 as (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, without using the formula, just computing each layer step by step as I did earlier gives the same result, so that's reassuring.\n\nI think I've got it. The value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3.\n\n29,524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3 can be computed as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That's another way to compute it, but either way, the result is the same.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Each step checks out, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed step by step starting from the innermost parentheses. By recognizing the recurrence relation and using a formula, we find that the value of the expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me start by computing the innermost layer, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Let me compute 3*40: that's 120. Then, add 1: 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, interesting. Let me do Layer 5 now: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 121*3 is 363. Then, add 1: 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 3*364=1092. Then, add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each step seems correct. For example, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, and so on. Each multiplication and addition looks accurate. Then, the final step: 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right.

So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recompute each layer step by step, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly, so the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(...)\n\nSo, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...))\n3. Continuing, up to the innermost (1+3). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, the first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( is inside.\n\nWait, perhaps an easier way is to see that each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 1+3 adds a new layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside that, another 1+3(, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nFrom the expression, after the first 3, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly, because each time it's 1+3 followed by another (.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers by the number of times you have to compute 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each time wrapping another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)=1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)=1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, which corresponds to the nine sets of parentheses in the original problem. Therefore, the final computation is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think if there's a way to represent this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, so a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a9.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nI can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution D. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1=4.\n\nWhen n=1, a1=4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier for Layer9.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, since each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the final value is 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

    "text": " Let me start by computing Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Layer 2 equals 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Plugging in the value from Layer 2: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 equals 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 equals 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 equals 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's compute that. 29524 * 3. I can break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without labeling each layer, just to cross-verify. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Then: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*(29524) = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Let me think about this. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me denote each Layer n as a_n. Then, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, we can find another condition. Let's compute a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula, a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substituting back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as we got before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and the recurrence relation. 2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost. 3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation. 4. Use the formula to compute the value at the ninth layer. 5. Multiply by 3 to get the final result. Both methods led to the same answer, so I think it's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'll go with 88572 as the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous value). This leads us through layers 1 to 9, with the ninth layer resulting in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yep, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing the innermost expression, each time you go out a layer, you compute 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think I did that correctly, 9 layers in total, each time computing the next layer as 1 + 3*(previous). Then, the final result is 3*(Layer 9). So, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*(3)^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result. It's always good to check using a different method to ensure that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expression by expanding all the parentheses, but that seems messy because there are so many layers. But perhaps writing out the first few terms and looking for a pattern could help.\n\nLet me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 88572\n\nSo, yeah, that seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly, so I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of each layer grows exponentially. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer. So, each time, it's tripling the previous layer and adding 1. So, each layer is 3n + 1, where n is the previous layer. That makes sense. So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. So, that's 9 layers, right? Wait, let me count: Layer 1 to Layer 9, yes, that's nine layers. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 29524, and then we multiply that by 3, giving 88572.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) so, in effect, each layer is built as 1 + 3*(next layer), starting from the innermost. So, perhaps I can model this as a recursive function. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a function f(n), where n is the number of layers, then f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nSo, f(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to f(9) = 29524\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Since each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation of the form f(n) = a*f(n-1) + b is f(n) = a^n * f(0) + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, more accurately, for the recurrence relation f(n) = a*f(n-1) + b, the solution is f(n) = a^n * f(0) + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), where f(0) is the initial term.\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = 1, and f(1) = 4, which would correspond to f(0) = ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust the indices. Let me think.\n\nIf f(1) = 4, then f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nSo, in this case, n starts at 1, with f(1) = 4.\n\nUsing the standard approach, the homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say f_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\n=> 0 = 1 + 2K\n\n=> K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n=> 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n=> 9/2 = 3C\n\n=> C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nWait, let's check that with n=1:\n\nf(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nn=3: f(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which also matches.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, which is our case, f(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2\n\n3^10 is 59049, so f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSo, then, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*f(9) = 3*(3^(10) - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2\n\nBut 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which is the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^11 step by step.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^11 = 177147\n\nThen, 177147 - 3 = 177144\n\nDivide by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572\n\nPerfect, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, so it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, plus 1. But since I've already confirmed it with both iterative computation and the formula, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Start from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer)\n\n3. Compute each layer up to the ninth, which gives 29524\n\n4. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( f(n) \\) where \\( n \\) is the number of layers. The recurrence relation for each layer is \\( f(n) = 1 + 3 \\cdot f(n-1) \\) with \\( f(1) = 4 \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\( f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( f(2) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( f(3) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( f(4) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( f(5) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( f(6) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( f(7) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( f(8) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( f(9) = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The outermost layer is \\( f(9) = 29524 \\). We then multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer:\n   - \\( 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Now, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each layer is getting bigger. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the total expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

    "text": " Let me start with the innermost parentheses. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, so far I have Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer 3:40. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Wait, 4, 13, 40... That seems like each term is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me check: 4*3 +1 =13, 13*3 +1=40, yes, that's correct. So, each Layer n is 3*(Layer n-1) +1. That's a recursive formula. So, if I can compute each layer using this formula, I can build up from Layer 1 to Layer 9. Let me try that. So, starting with Layer 1:4. Then, Layer 2:3*4 +1=13. Layer 3:3*13 +1=40. Layer 4:3*40 +1=121. Layer 5:3*121 +1=364. Layer 6:3*364 +1=1093. Layer 7:3*1093 +1=3280. Layer 8:3*3280 +1=9841. Layer 9:3*9841 +1=29524. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Wait, that's 3*40=120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this step by step. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading from top to bottom, that would be 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 *3. Let me write it out:\n\n     29524\n   x     3\n   --------\n     88572\n\nYes, that's correct because 3*4=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit:5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1:4. Layer 2:13. Layer 3:40. Layer 4:121. Layer 5:364. Layer 6:1093. Layer 7:3280. Layer 8:9841. Layer 9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a recursive expression. The general form here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so the total is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, which is a linear recurrence, and using the formula I derived, I can compute it directly without computing each layer step by step. But since I did both methods and got the same result, I think I'm good. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. The final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in three layers, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, innermost is 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, then 3*40 = 120. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller cases, so it's likely correct for the given problem with nine layers. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me write each layer's computation step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives us 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's multiply each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Yep, that matches my previous result. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n... Up to the 9th layer.\n\nWait, actually, when I started, I considered Layer 1 as (1+3), which is correct, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524, giving 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next part is (1+3(...)), so each ( adds another layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen moving outward, each ( adds another layer. Let me count:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\nLayer 3: (1+3(Layer2))\nLayer 4: (1+3(Layer3))\nLayer 5: (1+3(Layer4))\nLayer 6: (1+3(Layer5))\nLayer 7: (1+3(Layer6))\nLayer 8: (1+3(Layer7))\nLayer 9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nWait, so actually, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is (1+3(Layer8)), and then the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer9 as (1+3(Layer8)), which is correct, and then multiplied by 3. So, that seems right.\n\nLet me verify each step again to ensure I didn't make a mistake:\n\nLayer1: 1+3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer7 again. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1+3279=3280. That's correct.\n\nLayer8: 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 3*9841. Let me compute that again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524. Let me compute that another way to confirm. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 3*(1+3(...)) nine times seems like it could be a geometric series or something, but I'm not sure. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1.\n\nSo, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 + 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(1 - 3).\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nFirst, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n\na_n = (4 + 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(1 - 3).\n\nCompute 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - (-1/2) = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (7*3^{n-1} + 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (7*3^{0} + 1)/2 = (7*1 + 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (7*3^{1} +1)/2 = (21 +1)/2 = 22/2 =11. Wait, but earlier I had a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the recurrence.\n\nThe general form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. Here, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = B.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 =4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier. Let me check for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Which matches my earlier calculation where a_2 was 13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, we can compute each layer.\n\nSo, for Layer9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step computation, I had to compute each layer manually, but using the formula, it's much faster. So, perhaps I can use this formula to compute the layers more efficiently.\n\nBut, since I already computed each layer step by step and arrived at the same result, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute Layer9 using the formula and then multiply by 3.\n\nLayer9: n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\n3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, since each layer is a multiple of 3.\n\nWait, let me think about this. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I unroll the expression, it's like:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) nine times.\n\nIf I let the entire expression be E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern here where E can be expressed in terms of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, it's a linear recurrence, which I've already solved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating it. Since I've already computed it both step by step and using the formula, and both methods gave me 88572, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely sure, let me compute Layer9 again using the formula and then multiply by 3.\n\nLayer9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524 *3.\n\nLet me compute this again:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've verified this enough times. The answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: there are 9 opening parentheses, each followed by a 1 + 3(...). So, that means there are 9 layers. Therefore, I need to compute 9 layers, starting from the innermost. Let me start with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. So, let's compute that:\n\nFinal result = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's breaking it down incorrectly. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n9 *3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, did I compute Layer 9 correctly? Let me go back and verify each layer step by step because it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here? Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C +1\n\nC -3C =1\n\n-2C=1 => C= -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A -1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 +1/2 =3A\n\n9/2=3A\n\nA= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me see. The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 +3*(...), so if I denote S as the entire expression inside the first 3, then S=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) up to 9 times.\n\nBut in this case, we've already computed that S=29524, so 3*S=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a sum, perhaps I can model it as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach time, we have a term that is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, each layer is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, which is exactly the recurrence relation we had earlier. So, using the formula we derived, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2, which for n=9 gives us a_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^10=(3^5)^2=243^2. Let me compute 243*243:\n\n243*243:\n\nCompute 200*243=48,600\n\nCompute 40*243=9,720\n\nCompute 3*243=729\n\nAdd them together: 48,600 +9,720=58,320 +729=59,049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^10=59,049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 29,524*3 again to be absolutely sure.\n\n29,524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series with ratio 3 and 9 terms, but I think the approach I took is sufficient.\n\nSo, in summary, by computing each layer step by step and then using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, I arrived at the final result of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer starting from the innermost one. So, the innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Let's compute that first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value, we have: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Substituting Layer 2's value, we have: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 is a large number. Let me break it down: 9841 * 3. Let's compute 9000*3 = 27,000, 800*3 = 2,400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Now, adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 3*9841 = 29,523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, the entire expression is 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 3*29,524. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute each digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me verify that calculation again to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 30,000 *3 = 90,000, and then subtract (476*3) because 30,000 - 476 = 29,524. So, 476*3=1,428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572. Let me check if each step is correct. Layer1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29,523=29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. Yes, that seems right. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute this in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer1=4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer9, which is n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer9:29,524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me write each layer as a variable to make it easier. Let me denote L1, L2, L3, ..., L9 where each L corresponds to each layer. So, L1 = 1 + 3. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on, up to L9, and the entire expression is 3*(L9). Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, L1 = 4.\n\nNext, L2 = 1 + 3*L1. Since L1 is 4, 3*4 is 12. Then, 1 + 12 is 13. So, L2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to L3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2. L2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, L3 = 40.\n\nNow, L4 = 1 + 3*L3. L3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, L4 = 121.\n\nNext, L5 = 1 + 3*L4. L4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, L5 = 364.\n\nProceeding to L6: L6 = 1 + 3*L5. L5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, L6 = 1093.\n\nMoving on to L7: L7 = 1 + 3*L6. L6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, L7 = 3280.\n\nNext, L8 = 1 + 3*L7. L7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, L8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, L9 = 1 + 3*L8. L8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... Hmm, let me compute that. 9841 * 3. Let's do it step by step. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, L9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Again, breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3. 4*3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6 plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 is 27 plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6 plus 2 is 8. 2*3 is 6. So, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value was computed step by step, leading up to the final computation of 3 times the ninth layer, which gave us 88572.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me verify a couple of the intermediate steps.\n\nFor example, L3 was 1 + 3*L2. L2 was 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That's correct.\n\nL4 was 1 + 3*40, which is 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 was 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363, so 363 + 1 = 364.

Correct.\n\nL8 was 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 was 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. Adding those gives 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*29524. As above, that's 88572.

    "text": " Let me start by computing Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12.

Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this right. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and by working from the inside out, I was able to compute each step without getting lost. It's a bit tedious, but since each layer only depends on the previous one, it's manageable. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can evaluate it step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, substituting Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each layer is getting larger. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute that: Total = 3*29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, the total is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.

Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*29,524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: Breaking it down digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 + 1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Maybe using the standard multiplication algorithm:\n\n     29,524\n   x        3\n   -----------\n     88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each step seems to check out, and the final multiplication is accurate. Therefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable.

Because the entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me calculate 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and each time we add another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3, and each layer is one more 1+3. Let me count: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1+3*(Layer 2). So, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each 1+3 is a layer. Let's count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because each time we add another 1+3. Wait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9. So, I think I did compute up to Layer 9 correctly.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 1 as 1+3=4, then Layer 2 as 1+3*4=13, Layer 3 as 1+3*13=40, and so on up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount or miscalculate.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step, ensuring that each step is correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again. 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the first layer, which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, if I have Layer 9 as 29,524, then 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nBut let me cross-verify this because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let me try to compute the layers again to ensure each step is correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, 3*29524 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me consider that each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1 at the innermost part.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, using the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, I can compute each layer directly without having to compute each step manually.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but just to ensure that I haven't missed anything, let me check if the formula applies correctly here. Since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and we've defined L_n as the value inside each layer, starting from the innermost, which is L_1=4, then L_2=13, etc., up to L_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is defined as L_n =1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and we've found that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, so 3*L_9=3*(29524)=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} or something like that, but I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nWait, another thought: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, maybe it's equivalent to 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Because each layer is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2, and then multiplied by 3, giving 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Which matches the previous result.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it: The entire expression can be written as (3^{11} -3)/2=88,572.\n\nSo, that's a quicker way to compute it if I recognize the pattern early on.\n\nBut since I was initially computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me calculate that step by step. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because that seems a bit high. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080; 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270; 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600; 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, the total is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers of (1+3(...)), right? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see that each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more than the previous. So, layer 1 is (1+3), layer 2 is (1+3*(layer1)), and so on, up to layer 9. So, my earlier computation of 9 layers is correct, leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. But let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me see if this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. Let me write that down:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier:\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 =88,572. So, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*((3^{10} -1)/2) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88,572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). We compute each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe outermost expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 \\). Calculating this:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, so the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. Let me confirm that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so yes, each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, except the very outermost which is just multiplied by 3.

Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication step.\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nBreak it down as (30000 + 9524) * 3 = 30000*3 + 9524*3 = 90000 + 28572 = 118572. Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Oh no, I must have made a mistake in my initial multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, actually, 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1. So, 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4 = 29524.\n\nWait, so when I compute 29524*3, it's 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo yes, 29524*3=88572. I think I made a mistake in my second calculation where I broke it down as 30000 + 9524, which is incorrect because 29524 is less than 30000. So, the correct total is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I broke it down as 29524*3, I got 88572, but when I tried to compute it as 30000 + 9524, that's wrong because 29524 is 30000 - 476, so that approach was incorrect. So, sticking with the correct method, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another way to confirm. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiplying Layer 9 by 3, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or miscalculate:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is correctly computed by taking the previous layer's result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on. So, I think I can confidently say that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we evaluate each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial expression again to make sure I counted the layers correctly. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: each \"1+3(...\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, my computation of 9 layers is correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Each time I compute a layer, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me write down the layers with their values:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent.\n\nBut let me try a different approach to see if I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe there's a geometric series or something similar here.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*Layer9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, derived a formula, and confirmed the result using two different methods. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is found to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each being 1 + 3 times the next inner term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost expression. So, L1 = 1 + 3. Let's compute that first. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving out one layer, L2 is 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so L2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, L3 is 1 + 3*(L2). Since L2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so L3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer seems to be tripling the previous layer and adding 1. Let me check if that's consistent. L4 would be 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so L4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Each layer is 1 more than three times the previous layer. So, if I keep applying this, I can compute each layer step by step up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no. Let me check the original expression again. The outermost operation is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, actually, after computing L9, the entire expression would be 3*(L9). Wait, but in my labeling, L1 is the innermost, so the outermost layer would be 3*(L9). So, I need to compute up to L9, then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Let me make sure I'm getting this right. Let me list out each layer step by step:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so L9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Wait, no, hold on. Let me check the original expression again. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, actually, the outermost operation is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). But in my layers, L9 is the innermost, so the expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if L1 is the innermost, then L2 is 1 + 3*L1, L3 is 1 + 3*L2, and so on, up to L9. But then the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, but in the original problem, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so that would be 3*(L9). So, the final result is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29524. Let me compute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing L9. Let's go back through each layer:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nL3=1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nL4=1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nL5=1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nL6=1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nL7=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nL8=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nL9=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, L9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n\nThen, (1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer 2\n\nWait, no, actually, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), so each layer is one more than three times the next layer. So, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, L9 is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's 3*(1+3*(...)), so the 3 is multiplied by the entire nested expression, which is up to L9. So, yes, 3*(L9)=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I miscounted the layers because the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, each time you have a 1 + 3*(...), so the number of layers is 9. So, L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost before the final 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I computed L9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me see if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the outermost operation is 3*(L9), which is correct because L9 is 1 + 3*(L8), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, a_1 = 4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524.\n\nSo, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, factoring out 1/2, we get a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the multiplication. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 *3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5 *3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next term. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer triples the previous value and adds 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2.

Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nSo, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. That's the same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form solution to confirm the result. The final computation yields:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation would be: 3*(29524) Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up step by step: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*(29524) = 88572 Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364, let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.

That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNext, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nNow, Layer 4: 1 + 3 times Layer 3. That's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3 times Layer 4. So, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3 times Layer 5. That would be 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900+180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3 times Layer 6. So, 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3 times Layer 7. That's 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 times Layer 8. So, 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, actually, that's not the correct breakdown. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 3*29524 might be easier to compute directly. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because when I added 60000 + 27000, I got 87000, then +1500 is 88500, +60 is 88560, +12 is 88572. So, that seems correct. Hmm, but let me check with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 30000 \u00d7 3 is 90000. 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 3*(30000 - 476) = 90000 - 3*476. Let me compute 3*476: 400\u00d73=1200, 70\u00d73=210, 6\u00d73=18. So, 1200 + 210 is 1410, plus 18 is 1428. Therefore, 90000 - 1428 is 88572. So that confirms the result. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but before I finalize this, I should make sure I correctly computed each layer because if I messed up any of the layers, the final result would be wrong. Let me go back through each layer to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all layers check out correctly. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me verify a couple of the layers again.\n\nLayer 2: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*364: Let's compute 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*29524=88572, as computed earlier. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems accurate. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me see if there's a more efficient way rather than computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. This seems similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for each layer, we're computing a new term based on the previous one. \n\nGiven that, let's see how many terms we have. The original expression has nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 would be the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, which is a_1=4, and Layer 9 as the outermost, which is a_9=29524. So, that aligns with this definition.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3C - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed earlier.\n\nThis method is more efficient because it avoids computing each layer step by step, especially when dealing with a large number of layers. It's always good to look for patterns and possible formulas to simplify the calculation process.\n\nSo, in summary, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. By solving the recurrence, we found a closed-form formula that allows us to compute the value of the outermost layer directly, then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula\u2014lead to the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified the computations thoroughly. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe can break this down by computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me start by computing Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Let me write that down. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Okay, moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, this is getting interesting. Let's do Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. Let me double-check a few layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, maybe. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start, but since I wasn't sure at first, I thought it through step by step. It's good to see that both methods give the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " Let me start by computing the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me continue to Layer 4: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let me compute that: 364*3. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is... 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again to verify. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yep, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could add 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's see: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus 29524 is 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think I did this correctly. Each layer was built upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a geometric progression, maybe? Wait, actually, this looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me think about it differently. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as I did before. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall: For a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n*a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c = 3, d = 1. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^n*a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, our a_1 is 4, not a_0. Let me adjust the indices. Let me define a_0 as 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. So, applying the formula, a_n = 3^n*a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Plugging in a_0 = 1: a_n = 3^n*1 + (3^n - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Okay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula for the linear recurrence, I arrived at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I think I've solved it correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\(a_n\\), where:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 \\]\n\nCalculating this:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we have to multiply it by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, Final Result = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 29524.\n\nFirst, let's break it down:\n\n3 * 29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4)\n\nCompute each part:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 7 5 7 2 4.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7     3\n\n--------\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with so many layers.\n\nLet me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute it without going through each layer, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each layer as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 3*a_p + 1\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize this pattern as similar to a geometric series, but in this case, it's more of a linear recurrence.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in a base-3 system, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nIn any case, computing each layer step by step seems straightforward, and verifying with the closed-form formula gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, to recap, starting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident in the result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, Final Result: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made an error in multiplying 29524 by 3. Alternatively, I can compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.

Let's go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3 is 88572, right?\n\nYes, because 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this problem is to recognize a pattern or a formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Ln.\n\nLooking at the recurrence: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2=29524, as I computed earlier.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, because 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^11:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^11=177147.\n\nThen, (3^11 -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the result, using the formula. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple times now, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364. Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.

Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I did this right. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Computation:**  \n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
