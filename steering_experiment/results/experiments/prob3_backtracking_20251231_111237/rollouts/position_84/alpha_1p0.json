Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me think about the general form. Suppose we have an expression like x = 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). If this were an infinite series, it might converge to a certain value, but in this case, it's finite with nine layers. So, perhaps I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 39 = 40 ... and so on. So, in general, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, with f(1) = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution f_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: f(3) = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, f(9)=29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Either way, I arrive at the same answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. I started by computing each layer from the inside out, which gave me the value at each layer up to layer 9, which is 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, 88572. I also verified this using a recurrence relation approach, which gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I've covered all the steps and checked my work, so I don't see any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the nth layer is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this is repeated multiple times. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see. Alternatively, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me try computing the layers again, but more carefully. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern in the numbers. Each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is roughly 3 times the previous term, plus 1. So, it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but each term also adds 1. As we saw earlier, the closed-form solution is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) as a geometric series. Let me think. Each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I let S be the innermost term, then each layer is 1 + 3S, and so on. But in this case, since there are 9 layers, it's a finite geometric series. The formula we derived earlier is applicable here because it's a finite recurrence. So, I think the approach I took is correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern leading to the final result. Using the recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, we determine the value of the innermost expression and then compute the final result by multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series of 9 layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). If I expand it, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, when expanded, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, but multiplied by something? Wait, no, because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to write out the entire expression when expanded. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this. Starting from the innermost: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)))))))) Wait, that's getting messy. Alternatively, maybe the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4))) with nine layers. Hmm, perhaps it's better to stick with the method I used earlier, computing each layer step by step. Since I already verified that the formula gives me the correct a_9, and multiplying by 3 gives me 88572, I can be confident that's the right answer. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to write out the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Which, when expanded, is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 4))))))))) Let me compute the innermost part first: 1 + 3 =4. Then moving out: 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, then 1 + 3*40=121, then 1 + 3*121=364, then 1 + 3*364=1093, then 1 + 3*1093=3280, then 1 + 3*3280=9841, then 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, step by step, each layer builds on the previous one, and the final result is 88572. I think that's solid.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Let me list the values again:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term minus something? Let me check:\n\nFrom Layer 1 to Layer 2: 4 to 13. 3*4=12, 12+1=13.\n\nLayer 2 to Layer 3: 13*3=39, 39+1=40.\n\nLayer 3 to Layer 4: 40*3=120, 120+1=121.\n\nYes, so each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the recurrence relation is n_k = 3*n_{k-1} + 1, with n_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for n_k. The general solution for such a recurrence is n_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^k, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nn_k = 3*n_{k-1} + 1.\n\nAssume n_k = A*3^k + B.\n\nThen, n_k = 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^k + 3B + 1.\n\nSet equal to original: A*3^k + B = A*3^k + 3B + 1.\n\nTherefore, B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is n_k = A*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow apply the initial condition. At k=1, n_1=4.\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is n_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this for k=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor k=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nk=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is k=9, n_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo n_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(n_9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. Let me see.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, in terms of the layers, the outermost expression is 3*(n_9). From the formula, n_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*n_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*n_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute the result more directly without computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), the step-by-step approach was feasible.\n\nAlternatively, if there were more layers, the formula would be more efficient. But in this case, both methods lead to the same answer, 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step builds on the previous one correctly, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to building up powers of 3. Let me think about that. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 12. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 39. Each time, it's adding 1 to three times the previous total. So, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, after n steps, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, then times 3 is 88572. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. So, perhaps it's equivalent to 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). Let me see: 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, solve the recurrence, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern or using a recurrence relation.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, I think. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, and so the total is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(a_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation formula give the same result.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let's think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved as such. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c is a constant and d is a constant. In this case, c=3 and d=1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*c^n + (d/(1 - c)), where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in our case, c=3, so 1 - c = -2. So, the particular solution is (1)/(-2). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps we can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier computation. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let's consider the general case: If we have a nested expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers, it's a linear recurrence. In this case, a = 1, b = 3, and n = 9. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using the formula for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1), but wait, that's for the sum of a geometric series. Wait, but in our case, it's a bit different because each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n^{hom} = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier result. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer. That's more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, in summary, the expression simplifies to 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive relation. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_{n} = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Therefore, the innermost layer, which is layer 1, is 4, layer 2 is 13, and so on, up to layer 9 being 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication earlier.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 4, a_2 is 13, a_3 is 40, etc. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. So that matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recursion. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. So, left side: C*3^n + D. Right side: C*3^n + 3D + 1. Equate both sides: C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1. Then, -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Then, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Now, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), but wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let me recall the method for solving such recurrences. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented by a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form formula. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Thus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, regardless of the method, the result is the same. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which could save me time instead of computing each layer. Let me see if each layer follows a certain sequence. Looking at the layers: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me check: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13, which matches. Layer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 40, which matches. Layer 4: 3*40 +1 = 121, correct. So yes, each layer is 3n +1, where n is the previous layer. So, if I can model this as a geometric series or something, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let me think about it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Let me solve for A and B. We know that a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. Let's assume the solution is of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) +1 => A*3^{n} + B = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B +1 => A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B +1. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 3B +1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, we can find A using the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the final answer. I think this makes sense.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a pattern or formula for a_n? Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 13 = 4*3 +1 a_3 = 13*3 +1 = 40 a_4 = 40*3 +1 = 121 a_5 = 121*3 +1 = 364 a_6 = 364*3 +1 = 1093 a_7 = 1093*3 +1 = 3280 a_8 = 3280*3 +1 = 9841 a_9 = 9841*3 +1 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4, which is correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer. Let me think. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, L_3=1 +3*13=40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in this case, a=3, so the formula would be L_n = 3^{n} * C + (1)/(1 - 3) = 3^{n} * C - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition, when n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = 3^{1} * C - 1/2. So, 4 = 3C - 0.5. Then, 3C = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 = 9/2. So, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n}) * (3/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, that's (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods, step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula, give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent layer a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the value we're looking for is 3*a_9. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into this form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Suppose a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Simplify: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern initially, working through each layer step by step also leads to the same result. It's a good check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in either method. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each time it's 1 + 3n where n is the previous result. So, perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, the layers correspond to a_1 through a_9. So, the problem is to compute a_9 and then multiply by 3. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly: 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 59049*3 = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it using the recurrence relation approach. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, how many layers do we have? Let's count: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds one more. The original expression has 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand it all, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, maybe the entire expression can be represented as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding it: Let's denote the entire expression as E. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) If I expand this, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k for some k. Let me see how many terms there are. Starting from the innermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^9, then the next 1 is multiplied by 3^8, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0. Wait, but actually, each time you have a 1 plus 3 times something, so when you expand, each 1 would be multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers above it. Let me see: The innermost 1 is in layer 9, so when you expand, it's 1*3^9. The next layer's 1 is multiplied by 3^8, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0. But wait, actually, in the expression E, it's 3*(...), so each layer is multiplied by 3, but when you expand, each 1 is multiplied by 3^(number of layers from that 1 to the outermost 3). Let me try to see:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^9 when you expand all the way out. Then, the next 1 is multiplied by 3^8, and so on, up to the 1 just before the outermost 3, which is multiplied by 3^1. But wait, the very first term is 3*(1 + ...), so the 1 inside is multiplied by 3^1, then the next 1 is multiplied by 3^2, etc., up to 3^9. So, E = 3*(1) + 3^2*(1) + 3^3*(1) + ... + 3^9*(1). So, E = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683. Let me sum these up:\n\n3 + 9 = 12\n\n12 + 27 = 39\n\n39 + 81 = 120\n\n120 + 243 = 363\n\n363 + 729 = 1092\n\n1092 + 2187 = 3279\n\n3279 + 6561 = 9840\n\n9840 + 19683 = 29523\n\nWait, but that's the sum up to 3^9, which is 19683. But according to the previous calculation, a_9 was 29524, which is (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, if I sum 3^1 to 3^9, I get 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683 = 29523. Wait, but that's one less than 29524. Hmm, that suggests that maybe my approach is slightly off. Alternatively, perhaps the expression E is equal to 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) - something. Wait, no, let me think again. Each time you have 1 + 3*(...), so when you expand, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k where k is the number of 3s you multiply after it. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1, it's multiplied by 3^9, the next 1 is multiplied by 3^8, etc., up to the first 1, which is multiplied by 3^0. So, the total sum inside the outermost 3 is sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k. Then, E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). The sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Then, E = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier result where a_9 was 29524. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion approach. Alternatively, perhaps the number of layers is different. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each ( adds a layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another ( inside, so that's the second layer.\n3. Continuing, up to the ninth layer.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost part is 1+3, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds one more. So, if I have 3(...), then inside that is another 3(...), and so on, how many times? Let me count the number of 3(1+3...). It's 9 layers because each time you have a 3(1+3(...)), and starting from the innermost, you have to go out 9 times to reach the outermost 3. So, the sum inside the outermost 3 is sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, as before. So, that sum is (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841, and then E = 3*9841 = 29523. But earlier, when I computed the layers step by step, I got a_9 = 29524, leading to E = 3*29524 = 88572. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, let's see. When I computed each layer step by step, I had:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut using the sum approach, I got E = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nThese two results are conflicting. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is different. Let me recount the layers in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3... parts. Starting from the first 3, then each ( introduces a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another 3( inside, so that's 2.\n3. Continuing, each ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(...\n2. Then inside, another (, so 2.\n3. Continuing, up to the last (...). Let me count the number of ( in the expression:\n\nAfter the initial 3, there are 9 ( symbols: each 3( introduces a new layer. So, that would mean 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost layer is 1+3, which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds one more, up to layer 9.\n\nSo, using the step-by-step method, layer 9 is 29524, and E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut using the sum approach, I thought that the sum inside is from k=0 to 8, which would be 9 terms, but when I computed that, I got 9841, leading to E=29523, which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum approach. Let me think again.\n\nEach time you have a 1 + 3*(...), so the expansion would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... + 3^n*1, where n is the number of layers.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach, each layer adds a term, so for n layers, the sum would be from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me see:\n\nWait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous sum). So, when you expand all layers, the total sum is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which can be written as a geometric series.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I derived earlier was correct: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut when I tried to compute the sum as 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 19683, I got 29523, which is one less than 29524. Wait, perhaps I missed a term. Let me recount the sum:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k is 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683.\n\nLet me add these up:\n\n3 + 9 = 12\n\n12 + 27 = 39\n\n39 + 81 = 120\n\n120 + 243 = 363\n\n363 + 729 = 1092\n\n1092 + 2187 = 3279\n\n3279 + 6561 = 9840\n\n9840 + 19683 = 29523\n\nSo, the sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k is 29523, which is one less than 29524. So, why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 is for the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which would be 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^n. So, if n=9, sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k is (3^10 -1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nBut in the expression E, the sum inside is from k=1 to 9, which is sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k = 29523.\n\nTherefore, E = 3*(sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*29523=88569, which is not matching the step-by-step result.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I computed the layers step by step, I ended up with a_9 = 29524, and E = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, where is the confusion?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which would mean that the sum from k=1 to n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2 -1 = (3^{n+1} -3)/2.\n\nTherefore, in our case, if the sum inside E is from k=1 to 9 of 3^k, that would be (3^10 -3)/2 = (59049 -3)/2 = 59046/2=29523, which matches the manual sum.\n\nThen, E = 3*29523=88569.\n\nBut that's conflicting with the step-by-step approach where I got E=88572.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in the step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, let me go back to the step-by-step computation of the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nSo, a_9=29524\n\nThen, E=3*a_9=3*29524=88572\n\nBut according to the sum approach, E=3*(sum from k=1 to9 of 3^k)=3*29523=88569\n\nSo, there's a difference of 3 between these two results. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3... parts. Each ( introduces a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3(, there are 9 opening parentheses: each 3( adds a new layer. So, layer 1 is 1+3, layer 2 is 1+3*(layer1), up to layer9, which is the outermost 1+3*(...). Therefore, when I computed up to layer9, that's correct.\n\nBut in the sum approach, I considered the sum from k=1 to9 of 3^k, which gave me 29523, leading to E=88569. But according to the step-by-step, E=88572. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 is for the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which would be 1 +3 +9 +...+3^n. Therefore, if the sum inside E is from k=0 to9, that would be 29524, leading to E=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in the expression, the innermost term is 1+3, which would correspond to k=1, not k=0. Therefore, perhaps the sum inside E is from k=1 to9, which is 29523, leading to E=88569.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach, I ended up with a_9=29524, which would imply that the sum inside is from k=0 to9, which is 29524. Therefore, I must have miscounted the number of layers or the correspondence between layers and exponents.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 corresponds to n layers, where each layer adds a term starting from k=0. Therefore, if I have 9 layers, the sum is from k=0 to9, which is 29524. Therefore, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in the expression, the innermost term is 1+3, which is layer1, and that corresponds to 3^1=3, not 3^0=1. So, perhaps the formula should be adjusted. Let me think.\n\nIf layer1 is 1 + 3*1 =4, which is 1 +3^1=4.\n\nLayer2 is 1 +3*(1 +3)=1+3*4=13=1 +3^1 +3^2=1+3+9=13.\n\nLayer3 is 1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40=1 +3 +9 +27=40.\n\nWait, no, 1 +3 +9 +27=40, which is sum from k=0 to3 of 3^k= (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40. So, indeed, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nBut in the expression E, the sum inside is from k=1 to9 of 3^k=29523, but according to the formula, a_9=29524, which is sum from k=0 to9 of3^k.\n\nTherefore, E=3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in the expression, the innermost term is 1+3, which is 4=1+3^1, so the sum inside E is from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523, but according to the formula, a_9=29524=sum from k=0 to9 of3^k.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the formula counts one extra term, which is 1=3^0. So, in the expression E, the sum inside is from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523, but according to the formula, a_9=29524=sum from k=0 to9 of3^k.\n\nTherefore, E=3*(sum from k=1 to9 of3^k)=3*(29523)=88569.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach, I got a_9=29524, leading to E=88572. So, there's a conflict.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step approach. Let me recompute the layers.\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, a_9=29524.\n\nBut according to the sum approach, sum from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that's (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, a_9=29524.\n\nBut in the expression E, the sum inside is from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523, which is one less.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the formula is correct, and the sum approach is missing the 1=3^0 term.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost term is 1+3, which is 4=1+3^1.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 counts the sum from k=0 ton of3^k, which includes the 1.\n\nBut in the expression, the sum inside E is from k=1 to9 of3^k, which is sum from k=1 to9=29523.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9=29524, which is sum from k=0 to9=29524.\n\nTherefore, E=3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in the expression, the sum inside is from k=1 to9, which is 29523, so E=3*29523=88569.\n\nBut this is conflicting with the step-by-step approach, which gives E=88572.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in the sum approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 is correct, and the sum inside E is from k=0 to9 of3^k=29524, so E=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in the expression, the innermost term is 1+3, which is 4=1+3^1, so the sum inside E is from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523, which is one less than a_9.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the formula is counting an extra 1, which isn't present in the expression.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step approach, each layer adds 1 +3*(previous sum), which does include the 1 in each layer. So, the total sum inside E is the sum of 1's from each layer plus the 3's.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you expand the expression, each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers above it.\n\nFor example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^9, the next 1 by 3^8, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^1.\n\nTherefore, the sum inside E is sum from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step approach, the total sum inside E is a_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, there's a discrepancy of 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 is correct, and the sum inside E is a_9=29524, leading to E=88572.\n\nBut in the expression, the innermost term is 1+3, which is 4, and when expanded, it's 1 +3^1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 3^k.\n\nSo, the total sum inside E is sum from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523, but the formula suggests that the sum is 29524.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, let's derive the formula again.\n\nGiven the recurrence a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWait, no, a_1=1+3=4.\n\nWait, but in the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test for n=1: a_1=4. According to the formula, (3^2 -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=1 +3*4=13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=1 +3*13=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=1 +3*40=121. Formula: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, a_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, E=3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut when I compute the sum from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523, which is one less than a_9.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the formula is counting an extra 1.\n\nWait, no, because a_n = sum from k=0 ton of3^k= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nBut in the expression, the sum inside E is from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523.\n\nTherefore, E=3*29523=88569.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step approach, E=3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the discrepancy is due to the fact that the formula counts the sum from k=0 to9, which includes an extra 1, whereas the expression only sums from k=1 to9.\n\nTherefore, the correct sum inside E is 29523, leading to E=88569.\n\nBut this contradicts the step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, let me compute E directly.\n\nE = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me compute from the innermost:\n\nStart with the innermost 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 +3*(previous result).\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nTherefore, the sum inside E is 29524, leading to E=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut according to the sum approach, the sum from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523, leading to E=88569.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, and the sum approach is missing something.\n\nWait, let's compute E directly as per the layers:\n\nE =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nCompute innermost first:\n\nStart with 1+3=4.\n\nThen, 1+3*4=13.\n\nThen,1 +3*13=40.\n\nThen,1 +3*40=121.\n\nThen,1 +3*121=364.\n\nThen,1 +3*364=1093.\n\nThen,1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nThen,1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nThen,1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nTherefore, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nThe confusion arises because when I tried to represent the sum inside E as a geometric series, I mistakenly thought it was sum from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523, but in reality, the sum inside E is a_9=29524, which includes an extra 1 from the outermost layer.\n\nWait, no, because the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), so the 1 inside is multiplied by 3^1, and the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^9.\n\nTherefore, the sum inside E is sum from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523, leading to E=3*29523=88569.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step approach, it's 88572.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in the sum approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not represent the sum as from k=1 to9, but rather as from k=0 to8.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nIf I have 9 layers, each layer corresponds to a term 3^k where k starts from 0.\n\nWait, no, because the innermost layer is multiplied by 3^9, which would be k=9.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the layers differently.\n\nLet me think: the innermost layer is multiplied by 3^9, the next by 3^8, ..., up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^1.\n\nTherefore, the sum inside E is sum from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step, the sum inside E is 29524, which is sum from k=0 to9 of3^k=29524.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the formula is correct, and the sum approach is missing the 3^0 term.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^1, not 3^0.\n\nTherefore, the sum inside E is from k=1 to9 of3^k=29523.\n\nTherefore, E=3*29523=88569.\n\nBut according to the step-by-step approach, the sum inside E is 29524, leading to E=88"

    "text": " Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let's check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))). So, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, in total, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The first parenthesis is after 3, then each subsequent one is nested. So, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. Let's count the number of layers. Let me write the expression with indentation to see the structure:\n\n3(\n  1 + 3(\n    1 + 3(\n      1 + 3(\n        1 + 3(\n          1 + 3(\n            1 + 3(\n              1 + 3(\n                1 + 3(\n                  1 + 3\n                )\n              )\n            )\n          )\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nSo, each level adds a new layer. Counting the number of layers: starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer. So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3. Then the next layer is layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1). And so on, until the outermost layer, which is layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, total layers: 9. Therefore, layer9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, the expression is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13, as before. So, each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, as we saw earlier, this is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it with the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, with n=9, a_9=29524, then multiply by 3: 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it multiple ways now, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the 9th layer, \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, plugging into the general solution: a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Comparing both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, recursively, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.

Hmm, that seems correct. But maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, let's plug into the recurrence. a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here to compute it without calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write out the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Which matches what I computed earlier. So, to find a closed-form solution, let's solve the recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which is exactly what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's a more efficient way.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented recursively. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, in this problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Let me compute a few terms to see if the pattern holds. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. So, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Let me see if there's a way to generalize this. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, we can write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it. So, the expression simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2, which equals 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is a nested multiplication, so each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me set up the equation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand it, it's like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if I have k layers, the expression would be (3^{k} -1)/2. Wait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, as above. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Which again, gives the same result. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach gave me the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote the innermost expression as a base case and then build up. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, each a_n represents the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3*A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the first few terms to make sure. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, no, L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Hmm. Let me see if this is a geometric series or something else. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients, so maybe I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Assume L_n = A*3^n + C. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + C = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + C). Let's compute the right-hand side: 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + C) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*C = 1 + A*3^n + 3C. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + C = 1 + A*3^n + 3C. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: C = 1 + 3C. Then, 0 = 1 + 2C, so C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. Wait, actually, in my earlier breakdown, L1 was 4, L2 was 13, etc. So, it's a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent one adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times the pattern 1+3 appears: It seems like there are 9 instances of 1+3, each nested inside the previous. So, that would mean 9 layers. So, n goes from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can model this recurrence relation more formally. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence starts at n=1, with L1=4. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. Let me denote the recurrence as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. So, a=3, b=1. Then, the general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = (L_0)*3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but here L1 is given, not L0. So, perhaps we need to adjust the indices. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of it as starting from n=0. Let me try that. Let me set n=0: L0 = 1 + 3*L_{-1}? Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the recurrence as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, for n \u2265 1, with L1 = 4. Then, the solution is L_n = (L1 - c)/(a - 1) * a^{n} + c, where c is a constant. Wait, perhaps I should use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and a particular solution is L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our problem, n=9, since we have 9 layers. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since L9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step. It's efficient because it uses the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step layer computation and the closed-form formula\u2014give the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it more generally. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. So, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression in terms of exponents without computing each layer. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each time we go out a layer, it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, after n layers, the expression would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, as above. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer again. Therefore, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series\u2014the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods led me to the same result.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's define L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given L_1 = 4, so when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, since L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, plug B = -1/2 into the equation for n=1: 3A + (-1/2) = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, let's compute a few terms to see the pattern. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and the general solution can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*( (59049 -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to look at it.

L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Suppose L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step:** Multiply Layer 9 by 3:  \n   \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, and we have 9 layers. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let me try solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^(p) = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, the numbers go 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times the next nested term.
