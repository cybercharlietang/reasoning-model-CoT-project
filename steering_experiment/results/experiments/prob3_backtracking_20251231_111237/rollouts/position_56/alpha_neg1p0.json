    "text": " 2 9 5 2 4 * 3 Starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without going through each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute step by step. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which resembles a geometric series but with an added constant. Wait, actually, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me find the homogeneous solution first. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence approach, let me test it with n=1. When n=1, a_1 should be 4. Using the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, using the formula for n=9 gives a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572. So I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, we compute each layer's value and build up to the outermost layer.

Finally, we multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

So, putting it together: 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems right. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here, maybe a geometric series or something, but given that each layer is just 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a linear recursion, and computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Suppose I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers. In this case, a = 1, b = 3, and n = 9. The value of such an expression can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The general formula for such a nested expression is (b^n - 1)/(b - 1). Wait, but that's for a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. Wait, no, that's when you have a sum like a + a*b + a*b^2 + ... + a*b^(n-1). But in this case, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), which is a bit different. Let me model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence is L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard form is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_k^(h) = C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_k^(p) = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute this without computing each layer step by step, I could have used the formula for L_k and then multiplied by 3. But since the problem is only 9 layers deep, step-by-step computation is manageable and perhaps more straightforward for someone not familiar with recurrence relations. I think I've covered all the steps and verified my answer using two different methods: direct computation and the recurrence relation formula. Both lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Next digit:2 *3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 87572? Wait, that seems off. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digits. Let me write 29524 as:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying each by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 *3=12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7.

Wait, but 29,524 is 29 thousand, so 3*29,000 is 87,000. Then 3*524 is 1,572. So 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me go back and compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=1, then a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\n3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88,572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation.\n\nBut since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible, though a bit time-consuming. Using the formula is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, we arrive at the final answer of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using this recurrence relation, we compute up to Layer 9, which gives us 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\nFinal step: 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L_n can be written as (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For L_1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. But L_1 is 4, not 1. Hmm, maybe that's not the right formula. Alternatively, perhaps L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test that. For L_1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. L_2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. L_3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. L_4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula for L_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, since we have 9 layers, L_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(29524)=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Wait, that would be 88752? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Wait, that's different. Hmm, so my initial multiplication was wrong. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, putting it together: 8 (from the 2*3+2), then 8 (from 9*3+1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3+1), then 2 (from 4*3). So, 88572. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I thought Layer 9 was 29524, so 3 * 29524 is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step again without labeling the layers, just to cross-verify. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, as I double-checked each layer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or something. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I did before. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a geometric series. Let me recall the formula. For a recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Let me verify that. Let me see for n=1: a_1 = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{0} - c/(k-1) = a_1 + c/(k-1) - c/(k-1) = a_1. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{1} - c/(k-1) = k*a_1 + c. Which matches the recurrence relation a_2 = k*a_1 + c. So, the formula seems correct. In our case, k=3, c=1, and a_1=4. So, plugging into the formula: a_n = (4 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me compute that for n=9: a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. 3^8 is 6561. So, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2 = (9*6561)/2 - 1/2. Let me compute 9*6561: 6561*9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500; 58500 + 540 = 59040; 59040 + 9 = 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using both methods, I get the same result, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. The formula I used earlier is appropriate for such a recurrence. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtract equation (1) from equation (2): 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10}/2) -1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, each layer adds another term multiplied by 3. Let me try expanding a few layers to see the pattern. Let's take a smaller version first. Suppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that step by step: Innermost:1+3=4. Next layer:1 +3*4=13. Next layer:1 +3*13=40. Outermost:3*40=120. Alternatively, expanding it: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))) =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))=3*(1 +3*(13))=3*40=120. Alternatively, if I expand it fully: 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))=3 +9*(1 +3*(4))=3 +9*(13)=3 +117=120. Hmm, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*...))). Each time, it's like adding another term. Wait, perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*...))). If I let S be the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*...))), which seems similar to S = 3*(1 + S/3). Wait, let me see. Wait, perhaps not exactly, because each layer is 1 +3*(next layer). Let me think recursively. Let me denote the entire expression as S. Then, S = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*...))). But the inner part is similar to S, but scaled down. Wait, but actually, each time you go one layer in, you have 1 +3*(next layer). So, if I let S be the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...)))), which is 3*(1 + S'), where S' is the next layer. But S' would be similar but with one fewer layer. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the layers. Wait, earlier, I found that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as S = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with 9 layers. So, S = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) where the innermost is 1 +3. Let me try to model this as a sum. Each time, you're adding another 3^k term. Let me think recursively. Let me define S_n as the sum with n layers. So, S_1 =3*(1 +3)=3*4=12. Wait, but in our problem, n=9 layers, so S_9 would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 9 layers. Alternatively, perhaps S_n =3*(1 + S_{n-1}), with S_1=3*(1 +3)=12. Let me check: S_1=3*(1 +3)=12. S_2=3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(13)=39. Wait, but earlier, when I computed up to Layer 2, I had 13, and then 3*13=39. So, yes, S_2=39. Similarly, S_3=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*13)=3*(40)=120. Which matches the earlier example. So, S_n=3*(1 + S_{n-1}). Now, let's see if we can find a closed-form for S_n. Let's write out the first few terms:\n\nS_1=3*(1 +3)=12=3*4\nS_2=3*(1 +3*4)=3*13=39\nS_3=3*(1 +3*13)=3*40=120\nS_4=3*(1 +3*40)=3*121=363\nS_5=3*(1 +3*121)=3*364=1092\nS_6=3*(1 +3*364)=3*1093=3279\nS_7=3*(1 +3*1093)=3*3280=9840\nS_8=3*(1 +3*3280)=3*9841=29523\nS_9=3*(1 +3*9841)=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but when I computed the layers earlier, I had L_9=29524, and then S_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for S_n. Let's see:\n\nWe have S_n = 3*(1 + S_{n-1})\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nS_n = 3 + 3*S_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving S_n - 3*S_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0 => r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant solution S_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3 + 3*A => A -3A =3 => -2A=3 => A= -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is S_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition. Let's take n=1: S_1=12.\n\nSo, 12 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 12 =3C - 1.5 => 3C=13.5 => C=4.5=9/2.\n\nThus, S_n=(9/2)*3^n -3/2= (9*3^n -3)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: (9*3 -3)/2=(27-3)/2=24/2=12. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (9*9 -3)/2=(81-3)/2=78/2=39. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (9*27 -3)/2=(243-3)/2=240/2=120. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: (9*3^9 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, S_9=(9*19683 -3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Perfect, that's consistent with what I got earlier.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or find a closed-form expression, I end up with the same result: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me verify a couple of the intermediate steps again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula S_n=(9*3^n -3)/2, for n=9, S_9=(9*19683 -3)/2=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.

    "text": " 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Wait, but when I compute 3 * 29524, I can also compute it as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then add 9524: 79048 + 9524. Let's compute 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, did I compute Layer 9 correctly? Let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I just thought of something. When I first saw the problem, I thought of it as 3*(Layer 9), but let me check the original expression again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the inside: Each time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(... \n\nWait, but each time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer, but the first one is the innermost, so perhaps I have 9 layers. So when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, 3*29524=88572. So I think I did it correctly. Let me just try to see if there's a pattern here, maybe a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...)) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar, but in this case, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, it's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all the layers because if I made a mistake in any of the layers, the final answer will be wrong. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find another condition. For n=2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2): 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 +3=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A =1 \u21d2 A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 =4= C*3^1 -1/2 \u21d2 4=3C -1/2 \u21d2 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the innermost layer, but wait, actually, in our original problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, and each subsequent layer is built outward. So, layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Wait, but in our problem, the expression is 3*(layer 9). So, let me compute layer 9 using the formula. a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula approach also leads to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).

So, reading from the top, 29524*3=88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 *3: 29524 +29524 +29524. Let me add 29524 +29524 first: 29524 +29524: 4+4=8, 2+2=4, 5+5=10, write 0, carry 1. 9+9=18 +1=19, write 9, carry 1. 2+2=4 +1=5. So that's 59048.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer again to check for any arithmetic errors. Let's do that. Layer1:1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems right. So, I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * C + d, where d is a constant. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, a_4=1+3*40=121, etc. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say d. Plugging into the recurrence: d = 1 + 3*d. Solving for d: d -3d =1 => -2d=1 => d= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 +1/2 = 3A => 9/2 =3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier terms. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think that's solid.

So, reading from top to bottom, it's 8,8,7,5,2? Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 would be more than 80,000. Wait, no, 29524 is 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, starting from the right: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88,572? Wait, but 29,524 *3: Let me check with another method. 29,524 *3: 30,000*3=90,000, but since it's 29,524, which is 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476*3). 476*3=1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29,524*3=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer computation step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524*3=88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, maybe I can express this recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. So, a_n = A*3^n + B. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3 + B. When n=0, I don't have an a_0, but maybe I can consider it. Alternatively, let's set up the equation for the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, a_n^{(p)}=K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n= C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9= (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I had noticed the pattern earlier, I could have used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer. But since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a good way to confirm the pattern and ensure I didn't make a mistake. I think that's thorough enough. I can't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the result is used in the next layer. The expression follows a repeating pattern, which can be represented recursively. By solving each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using the recursive formula, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because each layer seems to be growing quite rapidly, so perhaps I made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 +3=4 Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose I have a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 +3=4. Then, f(2)=1+3*4=13, f(3)=1+3*13=40, and so on. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given f(n) = 3*f(n-1) +1. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume f_p(n) = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition f(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, f(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, f(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: f(1)=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*f(9), which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we determine that the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. Similarly, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of terms, computing each step is manageable. But just for knowledge, let me see if I can find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the innermost value and work our way out, eventually multiplying the outermost layer by 3. Using the recurrence relation and verifying with a closed-form solution, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 =4. Then each subsequent layer goes up to Layer 9, which would be a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression using the formula. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) up to 9 layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), with 9 layers. As we've found, the innermost layer is a_1 =4, and each layer up to a_9. Therefore, E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let me see: E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, E = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the same result, using the closed-form formula. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, the result is 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we find that each layer can be expressed as \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). \n\nFor the innermost layer (n=1), \\(a_1 = 4\\).

Wait, that seems off because 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 30000 * 3 = 90000. Subtract 476 * 3 (since 29524 = 30000 - 476). 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572.

So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841.

Correct.\n\nNow, multiply Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote a_n as the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression, which might have saved me time instead of computing each layer. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. The closed-form formula we derived is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is a neat way to compute it without iterating through each layer. So, for n=9, a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524, as above.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. It's reassuring to see that both methods, iterative layer-by-layer computation and solving the recurrence relation, lead to the same result. So, I can be confident that the final answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can efficiently compute the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Adding units: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 5 = 9, 0 + 9 = 9, 5 + 2 = 7, 9 + 2 = 11. Wait, that's messy. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them all: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, the recurrence would be L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, L_1 was 4, L_2 was 13, and so on. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(L_9). So, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, which is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 4 * 3 = 12, units place is 2, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, tens place is 7, carryover 0. 5 * 3 = 15, hundreds place is 5, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, thousands place is 8, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, ten thousands place is 8. So putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract 476 * 3 = 1,428. So 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute each layer step by step and see if the numbers add up. Let me list all layers with their computed values: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, multiply Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. Wait, but actually, L_1 is 1+3=4, L_2=1+3*L1, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me write down the first few terms: L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, etc. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula. Let's write the recurrence relation as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula and see if they match my earlier calculations. For n=4: Layer4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works, and thus the final answer should indeed be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So, reading from the top, it's 8 8 2 7 2, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we have 8 (from the ten-thousands place), then 8, then 7, then 5, then 2. Wait, that would be 88,752? Wait, let me check again. Wait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that's different from the previous calculation. So which one is correct? Let me add 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier, I thought I got 88752, but that must be incorrect. Let me verify:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7. Write 7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 7 5 2? Wait, but that would be 88,752. But when I added using the expanded form, I got 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. Hmm. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the digit-by-digit method, the digits are:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u2192 2 (units place)\n\n2 \u21927 (tens place)\n\n5 \u21925 (hundreds place)\n\n9 \u21928 (thousands place)\n\n2 \u21928 (ten-thousands place)\n\nSo, writing it out, it's 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when multiplied by 3, the result should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Wait, 29524 \u00d73: 29524 \u00d73 is less than 30000\u00d73=90000, so it's a 5-digit number.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, let's write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7         3\n   ------------\n     ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73 =12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n\nNext digit:5 \u00d73=15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit:9 \u00d73=27 +1=28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit:2 \u00d73=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88,572. So, the correct result is 88,572. I must have miscounted the digits earlier when I thought it was 88,752. So, the correct final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I added using the expanded form, I got 88,572 as well, so that's consistent. So, I think I made a mistake in the initial digit-by-digit multiplication where I thought the digits were 8,8,7,5,2, but actually, it's 8,8,5,7,2, which is 88,572.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because when you write the digits, the positions should be:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit:\n\n- Units place: 2\n- Tens place:7\n- Hundreds place:5\n- Thousands place:8\n- Ten-thousands place:8\n\nSo, writing it out, it's 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,572. That's correct.\n\nSo, to recap, I started with the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result of 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each layer computation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. If I let x be the innermost expression, then each layer is 1 + 3*x, and x becomes the next layer. Since there are nine layers, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Just to make sure, I'll compute it another way. Let me consider that each time we have 1 + 3*(...), and since this is a geometric progression, the sum can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me think about it. If I have a nested expression like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), it's similar to an infinite series, but in this case, it's finite with nine layers. So, maybe I can express it as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see. Let's denote S as the entire expression, which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). But S itself is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*(1 + 3*(something)). Wait, but S is the entire expression, so S = 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me denote the inner expression as E, so S = 3*(1 + 3*E). But E is similar to S but one layer less. Wait, but in our case, there are nine layers, so maybe this approach isn't directly applicable. Alternatively, considering the expression as a finite geometric series. Let me think. Each layer adds a term multiplied by 3^k, where k increases by one each layer. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 + 3 + 9 =1 +3 +9=13=1 +3 +9\nLayer 3:1 +3*(1 +3 +9)=1 +3 +9 +27=40=1 +3 +9 +27\nWait, so each layer is adding another term which is 3^k, where k starts at 1 and increases by 1 each layer. So, after n layers, the value would be 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... +3^n. So, for n layers, it's the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. But wait, in our case, the innermost layer is 1 +3, which is 1 +3^1, so that's the first layer. Then, each subsequent layer adds another term. So, for Layer 1: sum =1 +3^1=4\nLayer 2: sum=1 +3 +9=13\nLayer 3: sum=1 +3 +9 +27=40\nAnd so on. So, after n layers, the sum is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula we derived earlier. So, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, S=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, the entire expression can be thought of as 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) minus some adjustment, but actually, no, because the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k is (3^{10} -1)/2, which is exactly what we have. So, S=3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k)=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2=177147 -3=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Multiply by 3:29524*3=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers. Each layer is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for each layer, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => 0 = 1 + 2D => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

    "text": " 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carry 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So, putting it all together, the computation is: Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1, then the final result is 3 times the outermost layer. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's a linear recurrence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if there's a formula for such a recurrence. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers from 1 to 9), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to double-check, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula. For example, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which is correct. a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13, which is correct. a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct. So the formula works, so applying it for n=9 gives 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each layer's value can be computed step by step. After computing the innermost layers, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, then each layer adds a 1 + 3*(previous). Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1:1+3=4, then Layer 2:1+3*4=13, Layer3:1+3*13=40, Layer4:1+3*40=121, Layer5:1+3*121=364, Layer6:1+3*364=1093, Layer7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. So, that's nine layers, each correctly computed. Then the entire expression is 3 times Layer9, which is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute one or two layers manually. Let's compute Layer1:1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, I think I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4. Therefore, 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for each layer, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for Layer1: n=1, a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct. Layer2: n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. Layer3: n=3, a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer9: n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, as before. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and recognizing the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, the solution is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the answer should be 88572.\n\nBut let me check once more because sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\nLet me list each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121.

Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, so 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with our earlier computation.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f So it works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that matches my previous calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f n=4: (243 -1)/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f n=5: (729 -1)/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f n=6: (2187 -1)/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f n=7: (6561 -1)/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f n=8: (19683 -1)/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f n=9: (59049 -1)/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572.

    "text": " 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me do it another way to verify. Let's compute 29524 * 3 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3.\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistake in any of the layers, let me recount each layer computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo each layer is correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Here, n=9. So maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such a nested multiplication. Let me try to find a general formula.\n\nLet me denote the value of the expression with k layers as S(k). So S(k) = 3*(1 + S(k-1)). With S(1) = 1 +3=4.\n\nSo we have S(k) = 3 + 3*S(k-1). That's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is S(k) = 3*S(k-1) + 3, with S(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Let me find the general solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: S(k) = 3*S(k-1). The solution to this is S_h(k) = C*3^k, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. The nonhomogeneous term is 3, which is a constant. Let's assume a constant particular solution S_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 3.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2.\n\nSo the general solution is S(k) = S_h(k) + S_p = C*3^k - 3/2.\n\nNow apply the initial condition S(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => C = 5.5 /3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is S(k) = (11/6)*3^k - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(11/6)*3^k = (11/6)*3^k = 11*3^{k}/6.\n\nSo S(k) = (11*3^{k})/6 - 3/2.\n\nWe can write this as S(k) = (11*3^{k} - 9)/6.\n\nLet me check this formula with k=1: S(1)= (11*3 -9)/6 = (33 -9)/6=24/6=4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, k=2: S(2)= (11*9 -9)/6= (99 -9)/6=90/6=15. Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 2, it was 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, in my initial definition, S(k) is the value after k layers. So for k=1, it's 4, which matches. For k=2, according to the formula, it's (11*3^2 -9)/6= (11*9 -9)/6= (99 -9)/6=90/6=15. But when I computed Layer 2 earlier, it was 13. That's a problem. There's a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, let me check my recurrence relation again. I thought S(k) = 3*(1 + S(k-1)), which is correct because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then multiplied by 3. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), so S(k) = 3*(1 + S(k-1)). So yes, S(k) = 3 + 3*S(k-1). So the recurrence is correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed S(2), according to the formula, it's 15, but when I computed it step by step, it was 13. That suggests an error in the formula.\n\nWait, let me compute S(2) using the formula: S(2)=3*(1 + S(1))=3*(1 +4)=3*5=15. But earlier, when I computed Layer 2, it was 13. Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait, perhaps I confused the layers. Wait, in the problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2 is 1 +3*(Layer1)=1+12=13. But according to the formula, S(2)=15. So there's a discrepancy here. That suggests that my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence. Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So if I define S(k) as the value of the expression with k layers, then S(k) = 3*(1 + S(k-1)). So S(k) = 3 + 3*S(k-1). So that's correct.\n\nBut when k=1, S(1)=3*(1 + S(0)). Wait, but S(0) would be undefined. Alternatively, perhaps the innermost layer is S(1)=1+3=4, and then S(2)=3*(1 + S(1))=3*(1+4)=15, which matches the formula. But in the problem, when I computed Layer 2 as 1 + 3*Layer1=13, that's different.\n\nWait, I think the confusion is arising because in the problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), but the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So perhaps S(k) is defined as the value of the entire expression with k layers. So for k=1, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1)), but wait, no, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to recompute the formula correctly.\n\nLet me redefine S(k) as the value of the entire expression with k layers. So for k=1, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1)). Wait, no, that would be 3*(1 + 3*1)=3*4=12.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the innermost layer is 1 +3=4, then the next layer is 1 +3*4=13, and so on. So perhaps S(k) is the value of the expression after k layers, where each layer is 1 +3*(next layer). So S(k) = 1 + 3*S(k-1). But then the entire expression would be S(9), but the problem is 3*(S(9)). Hmm, perhaps that's where the confusion is.\n\nWait, let me try again. Let me define S(k) as the value of the expression starting from the innermost layer and working outwards. So S(1)=1+3=4.\n\nThen S(2)=1 +3*S(1)=1 +3*4=13.\n\nS(3)=1 +3*S(2)=1 +3*13=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to S(9)=1 +3*S(8)=1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*S(9)=3*29524=88572, which is what I computed earlier.\n\nBut when I tried to set up the recurrence relation earlier, I thought S(k)=3*(1 + S(k-1)), but that's not matching with the step-by-step computation. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct recurrence is S(k)=1 +3*S(k-1), with S(1)=4, which is what I did step by step. Then the formula I derived earlier was incorrect because I misapplied the recurrence.\n\nLet me try solving the recurrence correctly. The recurrence is S(k) = 1 + 3*S(k-1), with S(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: S_h(k) = C*3^k.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, let's assume a constant particular solution S_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is S(k)=S_h(k) + S_p= C*3^k -1/2.\n\nNow apply the initial condition S(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C =4 +0.5=4.5 => C=4.5/3=1.5=3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is S(k)= (3/2)*3^k -1/2= (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula:\n\nFor k=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor k=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor k=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula S(k)=(3^{k+1}-1)/2 gives the correct values for each layer.\n\nSo for k=9, S(9)=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, S(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the step-by-step computation.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*S(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I double-checked each layer, derived a formula, and confirmed the result using both step-by-step computation and the formula. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the next innermost layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer's result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinal step: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28.

Hmm, but wait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go back and check each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in computing each step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, but I have a feeling that this might not be the correct answer because the numbers are growing so rapidly. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recursive formula is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say Lp. Substituting into the recurrence: Lp = 1 + 3*Lp. Solving for Lp: Lp - 3*Lp = 1 => -2*Lp = 1 => Lp = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L9, we have L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, L9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Therefore, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, multiplying by 3 gives 29524 *3 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me just verify this with another approach to be absolutely sure. Another way to approach this is to recognize that the expression is a geometric series. Let me try to express the entire expression as a sum. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote the innermost as L1 =1 +3, then L2=1 +3*L1, and so on, up to L9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9. Alternatively, I can think of each multiplication by 3 as contributing to the overall sum. Let me try to expand the expression step by step to see if it forms a geometric series. Let's write out the entire expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote the innermost part as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me define each step:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(Step 1) =1 +3*4=13\n\nStep 3:1 +3*(Step 2)=1 +3*13=40\n\nStep 4:1 +3*(Step3)=1+3*40=121\n\nStep5:1 +3*(Step4)=1+3*121=364\n\nStep6:1 +3*(Step5)=1 +3*364=1093\n\nStep7:1 +3*(Step6)=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nStep8:1 +3*(Step7)=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nStep9:1 +3*(Step8)=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Step9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 *3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3\n\n=20000*3 +9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3\n\n=60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000 =87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524*3=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations. So, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using the formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Recursive Pattern:**\n   Each layer is defined as \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:**\n   Using the closed-form formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), for \\( n = 9 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Final Result:**\n   Multiply \\( L_9 \\) by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 29524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88572. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way.\n\nCompute 30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000. Then subtract 476 \u00d7 3 (since 30000 - 29524 = 476). So, 90000 - (476 \u00d7 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to check for any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 \u00d7 3: 300\u00d73=900, 60\u00d73=180, 4\u00d73=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 \u00d7 3: 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 \u00d7 3: 3000\u00d73=9000, 200\u00d73=600, 80\u00d73=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 \u00d7 3: 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which we computed as 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? Let me count them again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer. So, each time I compute a layer, I'm moving one step out. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be expressed with a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, this recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've got it right. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence approach also led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation. Using this relation, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final value of 29524 for the innermost expression in the outermost parentheses. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple layers, especially with multiplication and addition, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nWait, let me see the pattern between each layer. From Layer 1 to Layer 2: 4 to 13, which is 3\u00d74 +1=13.\n\nFrom Layer 2 to Layer 3: 13 to 40, which is 3\u00d713 +1=40.\n\nSimilarly, 3\u00d740 +1=121, and so on.\n\nSo, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1.\n\nThat seems to be the case. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 3a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using the method for such equations.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn our case, k=3 and c=1.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3B +1 \u2192 B -3B =1 \u2192 -2B=1 \u2192 B= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A -1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, that formula works perfectly. So, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, as I computed earlier.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(Layer 9)=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations.\n\n1. Identified that the expression is a nested set of terms, each being 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. Decided to compute each layer starting from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9).\n\n3. Computed each layer step by step, verifying each result.\n\n4. Recognized a pattern in the layers, leading to a recurrence relation a_n = 3a_{n-1} +1.\n\n5. Solved the recurrence relation and found a general formula for Layer n.\n\n6. Verified the formula with known values from the step-by-step computation.\n\n7. Applied the formula to find Layer 9 and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n8. Cross-verified using an alternative approach by expressing the final result in terms of 3^{11}.\n\nAll steps led to the same result, 88572, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3 to get the final result:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, yes, each step seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that approach to see if I can find a formula and maybe compute it more efficiently. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution comes from a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f So, it works for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula approach also gives us the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer adds another power of 3, scaled appropriately. But since I've already confirmed it with both iterative computation and the recurrence relation method, I feel confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the result is 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3: Let me compute it differently. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add all these up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recount each layer to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But let me try computing it another way to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is a recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, for n=2, L2=13: 13 = A*3^2 + B => 13 = 9A + B. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtracting the first equation from the second: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the layers I computed. For n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, matches L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches L2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, L3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, L4=121. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L9, which is the 9th layer, would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for L9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, after verifying using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute 3*29,524. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 *3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation. Let me check where I went wrong. When I did it digit by digit, I got 87572, but when I broke it down, I got 88572. Clearly, the breakdown method is more accurate, so I must have miscounted the digits earlier. Let me try the digit-by-digit method again, carefully. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add the carryover 1: 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add carryover 1: 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6. Add carryover 2: 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right: 8,7,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 87572, but that contradicts the breakdown method. Wait, no, when writing the digits, the first digit we write is the units place, so actually, the digits should be reversed when we write them down. Wait, no, in multiplication, we write each digit in its place. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: digits are 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when we multiply by 3, starting from the units:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Units place is 2, carryover 1.\n2 (tens place) *3 = 6 +1=7. Tens place is 7.\n5 (hundreds place) *3=15. Hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n2 (thousands place) *3=6 +1=7. Thousands place is 7.\n9 (ten thousands place) *3=27. Ten thousands place is 7, carryover 2.\n2 (hundred thousands place) *3=6 +2=8. Hundred thousands place is 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right: 8 (hundred thousands), 7 (ten thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is 29,524, which is less than 30,000, so 29,524 * 3 should be around 88,572. Wait, but according to the digit-by-digit, I'm getting 87,572. That's inconsistent. I must have miscounted the places.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the order of writing the digits. Let me try again, carefully.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 (units) *3 =12. Units digit: 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2 (tens) *3=6 +1=7. Tens digit:7.\nNext digit:5 (hundreds) *3=15. Hundreds digit:5, carryover1.\nNext digit:9 (thousands) *3=27. Thousands digit:7, carryover2.\nNext digit:2 (ten thousands) *3=6 +2=8. Ten thousands digit:8.\n\nSo, the digits are: 8 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, the number is 87,572. But when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, each multiplied by 3, I got 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12 = 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me check 29524. It's 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply by 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 units:2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens:7.\n5*3=15 \u2192 hundreds:5, carryover1.\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands:8, carryover2.\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten thousands:8.\n\nWait, so that's 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,572. That matches the breakdown method. I must have miscounted earlier. So, 29524 *3 =88,572.\n\nWait, so why did I get 87,572 before? Because I think I incorrectly assigned the thousands place as 7 instead of 8. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, when I did the digit-by-digit, I had:\n\nAfter multiplying 9 (thousands place) *3=27, plus the carryover 1 from the hundreds place, that's 28. So, thousands place is 8, carryover 2 to the ten thousands place.\n\nThen, ten thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the digits are 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my initial digit-by-digit calculation was wrong because I must have miscalculated the thousands place. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I did the breakdown, I had:\n\n20000*3=60,000\n\n9000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. That's correct.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake earlier when doing the digit-by-digit, probably mixing up the places. So, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the layers. Did I compute each layer correctly?\n\nLet me check each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer up to Layer 9 is correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, that's the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using another approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think.\n\nThis expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, each layer can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D \u2192 D = 1 + 3D \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 =3C -1/2 \u2192 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I checked each layer step by step, verified the arithmetic, and even used a different method with the recurrence relation to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step and then multiplying the final result by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13  \n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40  \n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121  \n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364  \n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:  \n3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"
