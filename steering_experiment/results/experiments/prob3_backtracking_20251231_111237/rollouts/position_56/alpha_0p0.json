    "text": " 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 8, then 8, 7, 5, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(...), and I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, that's Layer 1. Each time we go out a layer, we add another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3(...). Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers because each time we add another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, so actually, Layer 1 is the innermost 1+3, and Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is then multiplied by 3. So, my initial calculation was correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, then 3*29524=88,572.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed as a geometric series or using a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since this is a simple recurrence, maybe I can compute it step by step as I did before. Alternatively, the closed-form solution for L_n would be L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nLet's compute a few terms:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWait, if I try to find a pattern, perhaps L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test that:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches L_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches L_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches L_3=40.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which matches L_4=121.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, which matches L_5=364.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, which matches L_6=1093.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, which matches L_7=3280.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, which matches L_8=9841.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches L_9=29524.\n\nSo, yes, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result without computing each layer step by step. It's good to see that both methods give the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but in this case, since each term is defined recursively, the recurrence relation approach works well.\n\nIn summary, by computing each nested layer step by step or by using the derived formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1 \\) to \\( L_9 \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer:\n   - \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, reading the digits from bottom to top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that gives 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the layers go up to a_9, and the total expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the formula for the nth term of this sequence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and then compute the entire expression by multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, starting from 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. **Compute each layer iteratively**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in the individual layers. Each step seems correct. So I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So L_1 = 1 + 3, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's check this formula with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121.

Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the general formula, I arrived at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough.

Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Each layer correctly follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, unless I made an arithmetic mistake in one of these steps, which I don't see, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again because 3*1093 is 3279, which is correct, plus 1 is 3280. Then Layer 8: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then 3*29524 is 88572. Yes, that all adds up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose we define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we did earlier. Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods give the same answer. So, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the final result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me check that with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524.

Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200+210=1410+18=1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

But just to double-check, maybe I can compute a couple of layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 5: Layer 4 is 121. So, 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*364. Let's compute that: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*1093. Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280. Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence and find a closed-form formula. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous part and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for Layer n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, which confirms the result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods lead to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation.

Each layer is correct, so the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3(1 +3(...)), so after computing the innermost part, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So yes, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then double-checked using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, and both methods gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute each nested layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check Layer 8 again. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9841*3.\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: As above, 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nBut let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous). Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, we add another layer. Let's count how many times 1+3(...) appears.\n\nLooking at the expression, from the innermost, there are 9 instances of 1+3(...). So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, as I did before.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, Layer 1 was 1+3, Layer 2 was 1+3*(Layer1), etc., up to Layer9, which was the outermost. So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, computing each layer up to Layer9 and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Next one, and so on, until we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to write it out:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nThen each step wraps that with 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, as I thought. So, my earlier computation should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let me compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this recursion. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in this case, since n=9, 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I checked each layer step by step, then found a general formula using recurrence relations, and both methods gave me the same answer. So I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572. So I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. So L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, the formula confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the ninth layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time if the expression were longer. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this recursion. Let's see. The recursion is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, in my earlier computation, a_1 was 4, a_2 was 13, etc. So, more accurately, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result without computing each layer step by step. This method might be more efficient if the number of layers were larger, as it avoids repetitive calculations. But since there are only nine layers, either method works. It's good to know both approaches: the step-by-step expansion and the closed-form formula using recurrence relations. Either way, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think 88,572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Yeah, that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly because if I messed up one layer, the subsequent ones would be wrong. Let me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again because 3*9841 is 29523, right? 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, right? Because each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer, and there are nine of them inside the first 3(...). So, yes, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, I think I computed all layers correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 result I got earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the layers, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, plus 1. But I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, I've arrived at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost layer.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " 2 9 5 2 4 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524*3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. But wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to miscount. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...): From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(...), each subsequent term adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...): There's 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), etc. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(...). So, the first layer is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is (1+3). Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: After the first 3(, there are 9 opening parentheses: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, that's 9 layers, meaning that the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, and then the outermost 3*(Layer 9). So, my initial approach was correct, computing from Layer 1 to Layer 9, and then multiplying by 3. So, Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me verify each step again. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: As before, 29524*3=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct. So, using the formula, we can directly compute the result without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's pretty efficient. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have Layer 9, which is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each one step by step. However, for someone just starting out, it's easy to make a multiplication error, so double-checking each step is essential.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, each time, you're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This is similar to a recurrence relation. If we let a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, and so on, up to a_9=29524. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n starts from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(a - 1), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, let me recall the standard solution for linear recurrence relations of the form x_n = a*x_{n-1} + b.\n\nThe solution is x_n = a^{n} * x_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nIn our case, L_1 = 4. So, x_0 would be L_0, but in our case, L_1 is the first term. Let me adjust the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index from n=0. Let me redefine L_0 as the innermost layer. Wait, actually, in the problem, the innermost layer is L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) + 1. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2, with L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, using the formula for the linear recurrence:\n\nL_n = a^{n} * (L_1 - d) + d, where d is the steady-state value.\n\nAlternatively, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant.\n\nLet me find B such that L_n approaches B as n approaches infinity, but since our problem is finite, we can use it to find the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the first few terms and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nWe have:\n\nL_1 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nHmm, so each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each term is roughly 3 times the previous, which is expected because of the recurrence relation.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern in the form of L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test that. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But L_1 is 4, so that doesn't fit. Maybe another formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps L_n = (3^{n+1} + 1)/2. Let's test n=1: (3^2 + 1)/2 = (9 + 1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. Not 4. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's try to solve the recurrence properly.\n\nWe have L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it directly.\n\nThis confirms that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I computed each layer correctly because if I messed up any layer, the subsequent layers would be wrong. Let me go through each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3's:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me see: Each time you have a 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3:\n\nFrom the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 1+3, each subsequent 1+3 is nested inside the previous one. So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...)\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9 because each time you have a 1+3 followed by another layer, and the entire expression has 9 sets of 1+3(...). So, that's why I computed up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say we have a similar expression with fewer layers and see if the method works.\n\nFor example, let's compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). According to my method:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nThen, the entire expression is 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nLayers:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nEntire expression: 3*40 = 120\n\nCompute directly:\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let me compute that:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nOutermost: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nThen, 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for smaller cases, so it's likely correct for the larger problem.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal computation: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers earlier.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined by a recurrence. Let's say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by this relation. Let me compute a few terms to see if it matches what I did before.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that matches exactly what I did before. So, after 9 layers, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a closed-form formula for a_n in this recurrence? Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Wait, let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo writing it out: 8 (from the ten-thousands place), then 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So 88,572. So, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88,572. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers, let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I thought Layer 9 was 29524, but actually, 29,524 is correct. So, 3 times that is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula for a geometric series or something. Because each layer seems to be multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1. So, maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, that's a recursive relation. Let me write it down: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, because Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, so a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c)/(1 - r) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1}.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence, the solution can be found as:\n\na_n = A*r^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me try to find B. If a_n = B, then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nHmm, that's a fractional value, but our a_n are all integers, so perhaps this approach is not directly helpful, but maybe it can still be used.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*r^n = C*3^n.\n\nThen, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + B, where B = -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, that matches all the layers. So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 holds true for each layer.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572.\n\nWhich matches our earlier result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer, using the formula.\n\nSo, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used the recursive formula, and even derived a closed-form solution to confirm. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outward, we find each layer's value and substitute it into the next. Using a recursive approach, we determine that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives 29,524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but earlier I thought Layer 9 was 29524, and then 3 * 29524 is 88572. But let me verify each step because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times I see a (1 + 3(...)):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, I think. Because each time you go one layer out, you add another (1 + 3(...)). So, yes, 9 layers in total, each time building upon the previous one. So, my initial computation was correct, ending up with 29524 at Layer 9, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recursive formula. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nSo, we can model this as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. Let's find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 59049 *3 = 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that because 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check if I computed Layer 9 correctly. Because if I go back through each layer, maybe I made an error in one of the steps. Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait a minute, but I just realized that when I started, I thought there were nine layers, but when I labeled them from 1 to 9, each layer corresponds to each set of parentheses, right? So, the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 9 is the outermost part before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, no. Wait, the original expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 9. So, the computation of Layer 9 gives 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...3(1+3(...\n3. ...3(1+3(...\n4. ...3(1+3(...\n5. ...3(1+3(...\n6. ...3(1+3(...\n7. ...3(1+3(...\n8. ...3(1+3(...\n9. ...3(1+3))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each corresponding to one of my layers 1 through 9. So, yes, Layer 9 is the innermost, and each step out adds a layer. So, the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me just try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from 1 + 3, each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a recurrence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3.\n\nAs before, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be seen as 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer computation to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a certain sequence, perhaps a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, we can plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We also know that for the homogeneous solution, but since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can solve for B by considering the steady-state solution. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation step by step. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's the same as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: Each a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, expanding this, a_n =1 +3*(1 +3*a_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until you get to a_n=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^{n} +3^{n+1}*a_0, where a_0=1 (since a_1=1+3*a_0). Wait, actually, a_1=1 +3*a_0, but in our case, a_1=4, so 4=1 +3*a_0 => a_0=(4-1)/3=1. So, a_0=1. Therefore, a_n= sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k + 3^{n+1}*a_0. Wait, let's see. Let me try to expand a_n:\n\na_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}\na_{n-1}=1 +3*a_{n-2}\nSo, a_n=1 +3*(1 +3*a_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}\nSimilarly, a_{n-2}=1 +3*a_{n-3}, so a_n=1 +3 +3^2*(1 +3*a_{n-3})=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3*a_{n-3}\nContinuing this way, we get a_n=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^{n} +3^{n+1}*a_0\nSince a_0=1, this becomes a_n= sum_{k=0}^{n}3^k +3^{n+1}\nThe sum sum_{k=0}^{n}3^k is a geometric series which equals (3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 +3^{n+1}= (3^{n+1}-1 +2*3^{n+1})/2= (3*3^{n+1} -1)/2= (3^{n+2}-1)/2. Wait, but earlier we had a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of a_n as a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of a geometric series, the solution is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, as we derived earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps my alternative approach was leading me astray. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's the same answer as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the formula derived from the geometric series, I end up with the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where:\n\\[ a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\\[ a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n- Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe final step is to multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, how many layers do we have? Let's see, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same result. So that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the alternative method using the recurrence relation gives the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Let me write it down:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the closed-form formula, I still get the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). If I expand it, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nIf I expand each multiplication, it would look like 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1, but wait, no, that's not exactly right because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, not just multiplied by 3. So maybe it's more complicated than a simple geometric series.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I consider the innermost term, which is 1 + 3, that's 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*4. The next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous term). So, the expansion would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I expand all the way, it would be 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1 + 3^9*1, but wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so when you expand, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k where k is the number of layers above it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a sum. Let me try to write the entire expression as a sum.\n\nStarting from the innermost term: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I expand all the layers, it's like:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nIf I expand this, it would be:\n\n1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^8*1 + 3^9*1.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when you have 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), the expansion would actually be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. But wait, let's check with the earlier computations.\n\nWait, when I computed a_9, I got 29524, which is (3^10 - 1)/2. So, 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 is 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nBut if I consider the expanded form as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9, that sum would be (3^10 - 1)/2, which is exactly a_9. So, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is a_9, which is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is a geometric series.\n\nWait, but no, actually, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, which is 3^1 + 1. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(3^1 + 1) = 1 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 1. Wait, that seems to be adding 1 each time. Hmm, perhaps my initial thought was incorrect.\n\nWait, let me try to see: the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThe next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWhich can be written as 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, yes.\n\nThen the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, yes.\n\nSimilarly, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81.\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121, correct.\n\nSo, each layer adds another term in the geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it using step-by-step expansion, using the recurrence relation, and by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a geometric series. Calculating each layer step by step and then multiplying the outermost result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. I started from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_{k} can be expressed in terms of a_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_{k} = 3*a_{k-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{k} = 3*a_{k-1}, whose solution is a homogeneous solution: A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 \u2192 P - 3P = 1 \u2192 -2P = 1 \u2192 P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_{k} = A*3^k - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_{k} = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_{k} = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer k, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For k=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, k=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 30000 * 3 = 90000. But 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let's go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of layers (only 9), computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that this is a geometric series might help. Let me see: If I expand the expression, each layer adds a term that's 3^n. Wait, let's try to see: Let's consider the innermost layer: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nSimilarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWait a minute, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be the sum of a geometric series. Specifically, L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n. Let me check that:\n\nFor L1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor L2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor L3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, which is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is given by S = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r = 3, so S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer L_n, where n is the number of terms, which is equal to the layer number. Wait, let me clarify. Since L1 has 2 terms (1 and 3), L2 has 3 terms (1, 3, 9), etc., up to L9, which would have 10 terms? Wait, no, actually, each layer adds one more power of 3. So, L1 is up to 3^1, L2 up to 3^2, etc., so L9 would be up to 3^9. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it without computing each layer step by step. That might have saved some time, but since I already did it step by step, it's reassuring that both methods give the same result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we can compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost result by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nUsing the geometric series formula:\n\n- Each layer \\( L_n \\) is the sum of a geometric series up to \\( 3^n \\).\n- Layer 9: \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\)\n- Multiply by 3: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

So yes, 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if each layer is built on the previous one, a small error could propagate. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct.

Wait, but that would be 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. So yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Let me compute that: 30000*3=90000, 476*3=1428, so 90000 -1428=88572. That's another way to check. So, yes, 88572 is correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.

But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let me count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis is a new layer, so starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, the next layer is 1+3*(Layer1), that's Layer2. Then Layer3, and so on. How many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, let's see: The innermost is Layer1: 1+3=4. Then Layer2: 1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then the outermost is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Each layer is built upon the previous one, and each time, we compute 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, working through each layer step by step, as I did earlier, leads me to the final result of 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a geometric series perhaps? Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9, then the total expression is 3*L9. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for such a recurrence relation. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, the solution is Ln = a^(n) * L0 + b*(a^(n) - 1)/(a - 1), where L0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, our recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, so a=3, b=1. But in our case, L1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so perhaps L0 would be 1, since L1 = 1 + 3*L0, so L0=1. Therefore, the general solution would be Ln = 3^n * L0 + (3^(n) - 1)/(3 - 1) * b. Wait, let me double-check that. The standard form is Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, so the homogeneous solution is C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant, since b is a constant. Plugging in, we can find the particular solution. Let me try to derive it.\n\nLet me assume the particular solution is a constant, say P. Then, substituting into the recurrence: P = a*P + b. So, P = a*P + b => P - a*P = b => P*(1 - a) = b => P = b/(1 - a). But in our case, a=3, so P = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L0 = 1. So, when n=0, L0 = 1 = C*3^0 + (-1/2) => 1 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L1 should be 4. Plugging in n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2=13. Using the formula: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=40. Formula: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the general formula is Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Therefore, L9 would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the outermost term is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Therefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and L_1 = 4.\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\nL_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, let's compute L_9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88752, as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for the entire expression. Let's denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nSince there are nine layers, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), and each layer is L_n as defined before.\n\nBut we already found that L_9 = 29524, so E = 3*L_9 = 88752.\n\nAlternatively, using the general formula for L_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and since E = 3*L_9, then E = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nThus, E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWait, wait a minute, that's different from what I got earlier. Wait, did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, no, let's check again. If E = 3*(L_9) = 3*(29524) = 88752, but according to the formula, E = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, earlier I got 88752 by direct computation. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. I said that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Then, E = 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Which would be 177147 - 3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nBut when I computed it step by step, I got 88752. There's a conflict here, which means I must have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nWait, let's check the step-by-step computation again. Let me recount each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88752.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it should be 88572. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count how many times the expression is nested.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3)\n10. )))))\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is the one multiplied by the initial 3.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, E = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572, but step-by-step computation gave me 88752. There's a difference of 88752 - 88572 = 180. So, I must have made a mistake in either the formula or the step-by-step.\n\nWait, let me check the formula again. If L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then E = 3*L_n, where n=9.\n\nSo, E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nBut in step-by-step, I got 88752. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step.\n\nWait, let me recompute Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88752.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it should be 88572. So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for a different starting point. Let me re-examine the recurrence.\n\nWe have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 3B + 1\n\nSo, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nThen, using L_1 = 4:\n\nA*3^{1} + (-1/2) = 4 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = 3/2\n\nThus, L_n = (3^{n} * 3/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's correct.\n\nSo, E = 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88752.\n\nBut according to the formula, E = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. There must be a mistake in the formula approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula applies to a different starting point. Let me see. The formula for L_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the number of layers. But in our case, the entire expression is 3*(L_9), so E = 3*L_9.\n\nBut according to the formula, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so E = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIf n=9, then E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 177147 -3 = 177144 /2 = 88572.\n\nBut according to step-by-step, it's 88752. So, the discrepancy is 88752 - 88572 = 180.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, so there are nine \"1+3(\" instances, which would correspond to nine layers, right? So, n=9.\n\nBut according to the formula, E = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572, but step-by-step says 88752.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for the expression without the initial 3. Let me see.\n\nIf the entire expression is E = 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nBut when I computed step-by-step, I got 88752. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation of the layers. Let me recompute each layer carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88752.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's 88572. So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula applies to a different starting point. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the formula I derived was for L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4.\n\nBut perhaps the formula is correct, and I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation.\n\nWait, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88752.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 88572. So, the difference is 88752 - 88572 = 180. That suggests that either the formula is wrong or the step-by-step is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the layers again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine \"1+3(\" instances, meaning nine layers, right? So, n=9.\n\nBut then, according to the formula, E = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572, but step-by-step gives 88752.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think. The formula gives L_n as (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which for n=9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which is correct. Then, E = 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88752, which is correct. So, the formula approach must have an error.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula approach was for the entire expression without the initial 3. Let me see.\n\nWait, no, the formula was for L_n, which is the inner expression before multiplying by 3. So, E = 3*L_9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula by one layer. Let me check.\n\nIf n=9, then L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nE = 3*L_9 = 88752.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for E is different. Let me think about it differently.\n\nLet me consider that each layer adds another 3*(...), so perhaps the total expression can be represented as a geometric series.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*next_layer.\n\nSo, if I denote the innermost as L1=4, then L2=13, L3=40, etc., up to L9=29524, and E=3*L9=88752.\n\nBut according to the formula, E should be (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is incorrect because I misapplied the recurrence.\n\nWait, let me think again. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThe general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nThus, A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B +1\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 3B +1\n\nThus, -2B =1 => B= -1/2\n\nThen, using L1=4:\n\nA*3 + (-1/2) =4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= 3/2\n\nThus, L_n = (3^{n})*(3/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, correct.\n\nThus, E=3*L9=3*(29524)=88752.\n\nBut according to the formula I thought earlier, E=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused n in the formula. Let me see.\n\nWait, E=3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nBut according to step-by-step, it's 88752.\n\nWait, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is wrong because I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, if the formula gives E=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572, but step-by-step gives 88752, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, (3^{11} -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nBut step-by-step computation gives 88752, which is 88572 + 180.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy of 180.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step-by-step computation.\n\nWait, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nLet's compute it as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7, write 7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88752.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is incorrect because the initial term is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for the expression without the initial 3, so E = L_n, not 3*L_n.\n\nWait, if E = L_9, then E = 29524, but that's not the case because the original expression is 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 is the innermost expression after nine layers.\n\nThus, E = 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nBut step-by-step gives 88752.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in the step-by-step computation.\n\nWait, let me compute each layer again, very carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, L9=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88752.\n\nBut according to the formula, E=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is wrong because the initial term in the formula is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for the expression without the initial 3, so E = L9 =29524, but in our case, E=3*L9=88752.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, L9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, which is correct.\n\nThus, E=3*29524=88752.\n\nTherefore, the formula approach must have been misapplied earlier. So, the correct answer is 88752.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula approach was incorrect because I thought E=(3^{11}-3)/2, but that would be if E=L10, not L9.\n\nWait, let me check: If E=3*L9, and L9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then E=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nBut according to step-by-step, it's 88752.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me compute both values numerically.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nBut 3*29524=88752.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is wrong because I misapplied the recurrence.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me compute E step by step, without using the layers.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me compute starting from the innermost:\n\nStart with the innermost 1+3=4.\n\nThen, moving outwards:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nNext:1 + 3*121=364\n\nNext:1 + 3*364=1093\n\nNext:1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nNext:1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nNext:1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nNext:1 + 3*29524=1 + 88572=88573\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the outermost expression is 3*(...), not 1 + 3*(...). Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, so after computing up to 29524, the next step is 1 + 3*29524=1 + 88572=88573, but then the entire expression is 3*(88573)=265719, which can't be right because that's way larger than before.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the layers are only up to nine. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 =4\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...).\n\nSo, the layers are:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88752.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut according to the formula, E=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula approach is incorrect because I didn't account for the initial 3 correctly.\n\nWait, let me try to model the entire expression as a single recurrence.\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nLet me see if I can write a recurrence for E.\n\nWait, if I denote the inner expression as F, then E = 3*(1 + 3*F)\n\nBut F itself is similar to E, but with one less layer.\n\nWait, perhaps F = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with one fewer layer.\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express E in terms of itself, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula approach was wrong because I misapplied the number of layers. Let me check the formula again.\n\nIf L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then E = 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nBut according to step-by-step, E=88752.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula because the initial term is different.\n\nWait, let me compute E using the formula approach.\n\nIf E = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nBut according to step-by-step, it's 88752.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is incorrect because the initial term in the formula is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for the expression without the initial 3, so if I have E = 3*L_9, then L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, so E=3*29524=88752, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula approach must have been misapplied earlier when I thought E=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused E with L_10.\n\nWait, L_10 would be (3^{11} -1)/2= (177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573.\n\nBut E=3*L_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\n"

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, nested expressions like this can be expressed as a geometric series or using recursion.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n + C,\n\nwhere A and C are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^(h) = A*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 \u2192 -2*C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. It might have saved time if I recognized the pattern earlier, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step correctly, the answer seems consistent.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation to avoid errors.\n\n3. After computing all layers up to Layer 9, multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression.\n\n4. Cross-verify the result using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, ensuring that the answer is consistent.\n\nThis methodical approach helped me avoid mistakes and confirmed the correctness of the solution. It's always good to check work, especially when dealing with repetitive operations and nested expressions where a small error can propagate and lead to an incorrect final answer.\n\nAnother thing I could consider is whether there's a combinatorial interpretation or another mathematical concept that relates to this expression, but in this case, it seems straightforward as a nested linear recurrence. However, recognizing the pattern allowed me to derive a formula, which is a useful skill for more complex problems in the future.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem into manageable layers and systematically computing each part, I arrived at the solution of 88,572. The additional verification using the closed-form expression gave me confidence that the result is accurate.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, let me check that again:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, so 5 with carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo writing it down: 87572. So, 3 * 29524 = 87572. Hmm, but wait, when I did the multiplication, I thought 29524 * 3 is 88572? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572? Wait, no, wait: 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, so 29524 * 3 is 88572. So, my initial calculation was wrong. Let me verify: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit step by step:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 (tens place) * 3 = 6. Add the carryover 1: 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 (thousands place) * 3 = 27. Add the carryover 1: 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 (ten-thousands place) * 3 = 6. Add the carryover 2: 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, we get 88572. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, that's the final answer.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers, let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, each layer is computed correctly, and the multiplication at the end is correct as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, we have a recurrence relation:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, left-hand side: A*3^{n} + B\n\nRight-hand side: A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nBring terms together:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet's check this formula with the earlier computed layers:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute this using the formula directly without computing each layer.\n\nGiven that the outermost expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer, 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2} & : 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3} & : 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4} & : 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5} & : 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6} & : 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7} & : 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8} & : 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9} & : 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

But wait, let me check my addition again because sometimes when I do arithmetic quickly, I might make a mistake.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first \"1+3(\" is Layer 1\n   - Then another \"1+3(\" is Layer 2\n   - Continuing, how many are there?\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is \"1+3)\", so each layer adds another \"1+3(\" until the ninth layer. So, I think I correctly computed nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, yes, Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nWait, actually, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, the general solution for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found using the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. Let's use n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWait, let's check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, because (3^{n+1}/2) - (1/2) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. So, the general term is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3 multiplied by a_9, which is 29524, giving 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more by computing a few more layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step-by-step computation. For example, Layer 7 was 3280, which according to the formula, a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. Similarly, Layer 8 would be (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nSo, all layers check out with the formula. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.

Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9000=88048, +500=88548, +24=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let's recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to make this computation faster, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me see if this resembles a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. First, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows for a closed-form solution, confirming the result efficiently. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me try to solve it properly.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula to compute it without expanding each layer, just to confirm. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer.
