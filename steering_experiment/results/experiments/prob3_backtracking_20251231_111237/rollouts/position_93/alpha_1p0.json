So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The solution to such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is for a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Hmm, maybe it's better to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Then Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, in general, Layer k: a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c can be found, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.

So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.

So, if I define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression would be 3*a_9. So, in this case, we can model it as a recurrence relation.

Now, solving such a recurrence relation can be done using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is to find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Wait, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is 1 + 12, not 1 + 3 + 9. Hmm, perhaps my initial thought was incorrect. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step to see if it forms a geometric series. Let's compute the entire expression without substituting each layer. Starting from the innermost: E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote the innermost part as E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40 E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121 E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364 E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that's consistent with my previous calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I can see this as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see if E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we derived earlier. So, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 88572. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, if I expand it, it's 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{10} minus something? Wait, let me check. Let me try expanding the expression step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me distribute the 3s step by step:\n\nFirst, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, next layer: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nWait, but that's not the right way. Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(...), so each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me try to write out the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each time we add a layer, we're adding another term in a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4, then as we saw, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, which would be equivalent to summing a geometric series up to 3^10, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me try to see what the expanded form would look like.\n\nLet me write E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nIf I expand this, each layer adds another term. Let me try to distribute the 3s:\n\nStart from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me distribute each 3 step by step.\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)))))))) \n\nWait, that seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps each layer adds another power of 3. Let me see:\n\nFrom the recurrence relation, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{10} minus some term, but I'm not sure. Let me check:\n\nSum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k is (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Wait, that's the same as our final answer! So, the entire expression equals the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k, which is (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572. That's interesting. So, another way to compute it is to recognize that the expression simplifies to the sum of a geometric series with 10 terms, starting from 3^1 to 3^{10}. Let me verify that.\n\nLet me see, if I expand the expression:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nIf I distribute each 3, I get:\n\n= 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^{10}*1\n\nWhich is the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k.\n\nIndeed, that's correct because each layer adds another power of 3 when expanded. Therefore, the sum is (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572, which matches our previous results.\n\nSo, that's a more efficient way to compute it, by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. But since the problem was given with 9 layers, each adding another 3 times a term, it's useful to see both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach.\n\nIn summary, whether I compute each layer step by step, solve the recurrence relation, or recognize the expression as a geometric series, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.

Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. To solve this, we can write it as a_n + k = 3*(a_{n-1} + k), where k is a constant to be determined. Let's expand the right side: a_n + k = 3*a_{n-1} + 3k. But from the original equation, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so substituting: 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + k = 3*a_{n-1} + 3k. Simplify: 1 + k = 3k => 1 = 2k => k = 1/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). So, the sequence b_n = a_n + 1/2 satisfies b_n = 3*b_{n-1}, which is a geometric sequence with ratio 3. Therefore, b_n = b_1 * 3^{n-1}. Now, b_1 = a_1 + 1/2 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, b_n = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} = (3^2)/2 * 3^{n-1} = (3^{n+1})/2. Therefore, a_n = b_n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a base-3 number or something, but I think the way I did it is correct. Just to double-check, perhaps compute a few layers again. Let me check Layer 1 to Layer 3: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13 Layer 3: 1 +3*13=40 Layer 4: 1 +3*40=121 Layer 5: 1 +3*121=364 Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct.

    "text": " Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.

Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Maybe it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I did earlier. So, each layer is a term in this sequence. The nth term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.

Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation part. 3^10: Let's compute step by step: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524*3 another way. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, same result.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Let's assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. On the other hand, a_n = A*3^n + B. So, equating the two expressions: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13.

So yes, that seems to hold. Alternatively, maybe this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence might give a closed-form expression. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. k=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. k=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly without computing each layer. Since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

Wait, maybe I should derive it. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. Let's find a general formula.

Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. So, that's consistent with what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572.

The general formula for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where r is the common ratio, which is 3 here, and B is a constant. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from 1. So, the expression is essentially 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, it's similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). As we saw, using the recursive formula or the closed-form expression both lead us to the same result.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be written as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, here, k = 3, c = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but I think the recurrence approach is solid here. So, to recap, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 4. The formula gives us each layer's value, and we can compute up to layer 9, then multiply by 3. So, after computing, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just do a quick check by computing a few layers again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 +3=4.

Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is a_3=40. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the innermost part, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, but hold on, in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4, corresponding to n=1. So when we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Wait, but in our previous calculation, we computed Layer 9 as 29524, which is (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is known. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, but maybe it's better to solve it step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is linear and nonhomogeneous. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So that's consistent.

So, this is a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me try to find the particular solution. Assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Wait, that's a fractional value, but our initial conditions are integers. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is 3^{n}, so the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + C. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + C = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + C) => A*3^{n} + C = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3C => Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.

So in general, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is known. The recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), but wait, actually, the standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n} * (L_0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4. So perhaps L_n = 3^{n} * C + (1)/(1 - 3). Let me compute the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. So substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1.

So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. This is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found by iteration. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = (a_1 + d/(c-1)) * c^{n-1} - d/(c-1). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n-1}*(a_1 + d/(c-1)) - d/(c-1). Let me verify that. Let's test it for n=1: a_1 = c^{0}*(a_1 + d/(c-1)) - d/(c-1) = 1*(a1 + d/(c-1)) - d/(c-1) = a1 + d/(c-1) - d/(c-1) = a1. Correct. For n=2: a2 = c*a1 + d. Using the formula: a2 = c^{1}*(a1 + d/(c-1)) - d/(c-1) = c*a1 + c*d/(c-1) - d/(c-1) = c*a1 + (c*d - d)/(c-1) = c*a1 + d*(c -1)/(c-1) = c*a1 + d. Correct. So the formula holds. In our case, c=3, d=1. So the solution is a_n = 3^{n-1}*(a1 + 1/(3-1)) - 1/(3-1) = 3^{n-1}*(4 + 1/2) - 1/2 = 3^{n-1}*(9/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2.

This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. Let's find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049.

The homogeneous solution would be a_n = A*(3)^n, and the particular solution would be a constant. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me write the homogeneous solution as a_n^h = C*3^n. Then, find a particular solution, say a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.

So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let's see: The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be found by assuming L_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.

So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{hom} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).

    "text": " Let me think. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))) with n layers. This is similar to a continued multiplication. Let me denote each layer as L_k, where k is the layer number. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 =88572. So, that's another way to get to the same answer, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula. This might be a more efficient way if the number of layers were larger, but for 9 layers, step-by-step computation is manageable. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me consider a general form. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication problem with a repeating pattern. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value and substitute it into the next. Using the formula for the linear recurrence relation, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern until the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. The final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested set of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."
