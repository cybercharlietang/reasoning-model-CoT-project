    "text": " Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for L_n. Let me see: The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, we get the same result.

Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, substituting the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B So, the equation becomes: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 terms, computing each step is straightforward. Alternatively, the closed-form formula for a geometric series. Let me see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this method also confirms the result.

For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.

The solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.

Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but in this case, a_1 is 4, so maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4.

Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280.

Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 1 + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, which is Layer 3. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, I can check with n=4: a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which is correct. So, the formula holds.

    "text": " Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, the value is 1 + 3n, where n is the previous value. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me think about how to solve it more formally. Let\u2019s denote L_k as the value at layer k. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... And so on. So, in general, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When k=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's find another equation. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the closed-form: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So now we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4 2) 9A + B = 13 Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Then plugging back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1)/2. So the closed-form expression is L_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, for layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Therefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Just to make sure, I'll cross-verify using the closed-form expression. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10} directly. 3^10 is 59049, as above. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous calculation. Alternatively, if I use the closed-form expression, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Alternatively, if I were to look for a general formula for such a nested expression, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming L_n^{(p)} = D, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Alternatively, I can think about the recurrence relation here. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

    "text": " Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

    "text": " Let me think about it. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13.

A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, but wait, in our earlier computation, a_1 was the innermost layer, which was 4, and a_9 would be the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, let me check: If a_1 is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, which is Layer 2, and so on up to a_9 = 29524. So, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049.

I think that's correct. Let me just check with a smaller version to see if the formula works. Let's say we have only one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. Using the formula, a_1 = 4, then total expression is 3*a_1 = 12. Correct. Two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Using the formula, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Then total expression is 3*a_2=39. Correct. Similarly, three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40=120. Using the formula, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Then total expression is 3*40=120. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for 9 layers, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.

So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.

Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. So, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation.

Applying this formula to the innermost layer and propagating outward, we determine the value of the entire expression. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer n is 1 + 3*layer(n-1). This is a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a recursion. The recursion is layer(n) = 1 + 3*layer(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be layer(n) = A*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is layer(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: At n=1, layer(1)=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is layer(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, layer(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*layer(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, each layer adds another 3^k term. Let me try to see the pattern. Let me denote E as the entire expression. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me see how many times 3 is multiplied. Each time, we have one more layer. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), etc. If I expand E, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand it step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote S_k as the sum after k layers. So, S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 S_3 = 1 + 3*S_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 S_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 S_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 S_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 S_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 S_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 S_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then E = 3*S_9 = 88572 So, yes, that's consistent with my previous calculations. Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, layer(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, layer(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then E = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the recurrence into this form. L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. If L_n = A*3^n + B, then substituting into the equation: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.

This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's see if that works. Let's compute the first few terms using the recurrence and see if we can find a pattern. From above, we have: L1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1 L2 = 13 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 L3 = 40 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 L4 = 121 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 L5 = 364 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 L6 = 1093 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 L7 = 3280 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 L8 = 9841 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 L9 = 29524 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's model this as a recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. To find a closed-form solution, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L(n) = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p = C.

Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got before.

    "text": " Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. So, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. When n=2, a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substitute A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can write this as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 terms, computing each is straightforward. However, for practice, maybe I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.

    "text": " Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote the nth layer as L_n. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, actually, L_1 was 1 + 3, which is 4, so L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which also matches. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct. So, the general formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, but let me clarify: The innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 wraps around that, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9, which is the outermost expression. Therefore, Layer 9 = L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I wanted to use the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, same result. So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's only 9 terms, computing each step is feasible. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term adds another layer. So, perhaps it's better to think of it as a geometric progression. Let me see: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n... and so on.\n\nIn general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).

Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 3, a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula works.
