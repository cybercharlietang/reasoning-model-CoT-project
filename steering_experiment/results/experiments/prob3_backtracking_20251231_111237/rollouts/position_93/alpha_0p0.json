    "text": " Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that approach. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using the recurrence relation method. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier, but since the number of layers isn't too large, computing each step was feasible. I think I've double-checked it sufficiently, so I'm confident the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So perhaps the solution is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe my initial conditions are different. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches a_2=13.

So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. To solve this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form formula. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Let me check that formula. Alternatively, solving the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, assume a constant solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the equation: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, in this case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, as computed before. The overall expression is 3*a_9. Now, to find a general formula for a_k, we can observe that each a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_k = C*3^k + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's find D first. The homogeneous solution is a_k = C*3^k. To find a particular solution, assume a constant solution D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When k=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = k * a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c * (k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. But actually, let me check: The standard form is a_n = k * a_{n-1} + c. Here, a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1. So, yes, k=3, c=1. The solution is a_n = k^{n} * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, but in our case, the initial term is a_1=4, not a_0. So perhaps we need to adjust the indices. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute it directly as I did before, since n=9 is manageable. But just for fun, let's try to find a formula. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)}=A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. Let's say n=1: a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9.

The value can be found using the formula for a geometric series, but in this case, it's not exactly a standard geometric series because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_k as the value at layer k. Then, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k+1}, with L_9 being the innermost layer. Wait, actually, the innermost layer is L_1 = 1 + 3. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, the recurrence is L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} for k from 2 to 9, with L_1 = 4.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

The general formula for such a nested expression with n layers is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me think. Let me consider that each layer is a term in a sequence. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, if I can find a closed-form formula, it might save time for larger n, but since n=9 here, computing step by step is feasible. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*(3)^n. A particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. This could be useful if we had more layers, but for n=9, it's manageable either way. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer grows by a factor of 3 plus 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, to find a_n, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I also get 88572. That confirms my earlier step-by-step computation.

Let's solve it: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.

The formula for such a nested expression is (a*b^{n} - b)/(b - 1). Wait, let me recall the formula for a finite nested expression. If you have x = a + b(a + b(a + ... + b(a))), with n terms, then x can be expressed as x = a*(1 - b^{n})/(1 - b) + (b^{n})*a. Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think. Alternatively, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me define L_k as the value at layer k. Then, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^{k} + C, where A and C are constants to be determined. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_k^h = A*3^{k}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_k^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = A*3^{k} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

For n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.

The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Let's compute a few terms: a1=4, a2=1+3*4=13, a3=1+3*13=40, a4=1+3*40=121, etc. Let me see if I can find a pattern.

Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. So this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.

The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have an expression like a + a(a + a(a + ... )) with n layers. In this case, a is 3, and each term is 1 + 3*(next term). Wait, actually, it's more like each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Hmm. Let me define it recursively. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Let's solve for A and B. When n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0, if we define a_0 = 1 (since a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0), then a_0 = 1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B. So we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and A + B = 1. Subtracting the second equation from the first: 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then from A + B =1, B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for layer n, which goes from 1 to 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049.

Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence relation can be found by recognizing it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=3, d=1. Let's see: The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Now, let's see if we can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let me write down the first few terms: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is 88572.

Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it more formally. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0, perhaps? Wait, actually, the recurrence starts at n=1, so maybe we can find a homogeneous solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms the answer.

    "text": " Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated 9 times, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.

So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that confirms the result. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, I could have directly used a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2 and then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.
