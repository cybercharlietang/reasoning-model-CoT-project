    "text": " So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9000 = 88048, +500 = 88548, +24 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, putting it all together, each layer is computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on. Starting from the innermost, each step gives the next layer. After computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572. Let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).

Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated. After computing up to the ninth layer, which results in 29524, the final step is to multiply this value by 3, yielding the answer 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, starting from the right: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, so 7, carry 0. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: Let's compute 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 500 = 88548; 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to confirm my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each layer's value. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form solution, confirming that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\( a_n \\) represent the value at each layer, starting from the innermost. The relation is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n   The recurrence \\( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\) is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. Its solution is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer:**\n   Starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\), compute each subsequent layer up to \\( a_9 \\):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times \\( a_9 \\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me do it again step by step.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.

Wait, but 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88,572 because 29,524 \u00d7 3 is 88,572. Wait, perhaps I missed a digit. Let me compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 properly.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87,572. But wait, 29,524 \u00d7 3 is actually 88,572 because 30,000 \u00d7 3 = 90,000, so 29,524 \u00d7 3 should be 88,572. I think I made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me verify:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 87,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 88,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88,560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88,572.\n\nAh, yes, that's correct. So the multiplication should result in 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the step-by-step multiplication, I thought I got 87,572, which is incorrect. So, it's important to double-check. The correct total after multiplying 29,524 by 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nLet me recap the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. So, starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again because I think I might have made a mistake there. Layer 6 was 1,093. Then Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, the computation of each layer seems accurate.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute each layer again just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12 \u2192 900+180=1,080 +12=1,092. So, 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000+270=3,270 +9=3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9,000+600=9,600 +240=9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Then, the final step is 3*29,524. As I did earlier, 29,524*3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000 (total 87,000); 500*3=1,500 (total 88,500); 20*3=60 (total 88,560); 4*3=12 (total 88,572). So, yes, 88,572 is correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I should check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, there's 1+3(...), which is Layer 1. Then, inside that, another 1+3(...), which is Layer 2, and so on. How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3( corresponds to a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(, which means there are 9 layers. Wait, but in my earlier computation, I only went up to Layer 9, which was 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the initial 3(, the first inner expression is 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on, until the innermost is 1+3). Let me count the number of 1+3( after the initial 3(.\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(, so starting from the first after 3(:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, 9 times. Then, the innermost is 1+3), which is Layer 1. So, yes, 9 layers. So, my computation up to Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, just in case I made any miscalculations earlier.\n\nStarting from the innermost Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.

Hmm, I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are getting large quickly, but each step seems to follow logically. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested rather than summed. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each a_n is built from the previous term. So, the sequence is:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n... and so on, up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nSo, the problem is essentially computing 3*a_9.\n\nNow, I wonder if there's a closed-form formula for a_n in this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in a base-3 system, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nIn summary, by computing each nested layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I've arrived at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, and then applying the final multiplication by 3, we arrive at the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 30000 * 3 = 90000. But 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3). 476 * 3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the original expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back and check each layer computation because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Suppose we define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built from the previous one. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, we arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, it might form a geometric series when I distribute all the terms. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nBut if I try to write the entire expression without parentheses, it would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems messy. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see that each time we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, so it's like a geometric progression with ratio 3, but with an added 1 each time. Hmm, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have a formula for a_n, as we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: Let's consider the expression E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. If I let E_n be the value after n layers, then E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), starting with E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps not. Since each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and E = 3*a_9, which we've already computed.\n\nI think the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation both confirm that the answer is 88572. So, I feel confident that's the correct result.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Start from the innermost parentheses and compute each layer step by step.\n2. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n3. After computing up to the 9th layer, multiply the result by 3.\n4. Verify using a recurrence relation approach to ensure the result is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward and applying the recurrence relation, we find the result to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which resembles a geometric series. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, actually, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step seems to follow correctly, and the closed-form formula also confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 87572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to verify. Let me think. This expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. It resembles a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1 each time. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 87572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 87572. Alternatively, I could compute each layer step by step without using the formula, but since I've already done that and cross-verified using the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the answer is correct. So, after working through each layer, computing each step carefully, and then verifying using a mathematical formula, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 87572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and has the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + d, where d is the steady-state value.\n\nLet me find d first. When n approaches infinity, L_n = L_{n-1} = d. So, d = 1 + 3*d. Solving for d:\n\nd = 1 + 3d  \nd - 3d = 1  \n-2d = 1  \nd = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2  \n4 = 3C - 1/2  \n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9 for the innermost layer, but wait, actually, in the expression, the outermost layer is the first one we encounter, so perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Wait, no, in my earlier approach, Layer 1 was the innermost, so Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on, with Layer 1 being 1 + 3.\n\nSo, if I use the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=9, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, if I have 9 layers, then Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, which is correct. So, the final result is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which matches the earlier result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer step by step.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify a particular method, just to compute it, either way works. I think I've verified it sufficiently. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3. Layer 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n4. Layer 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n5.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, actually, it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value at the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can compute a_2, a_3, ..., a_9 using this recurrence relation. Let me write down the values again: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as before, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. And the recurrence relation can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. Let me try another approach to verify the result. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions and C is a particular solution. Let's solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. First, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = B*3^{n}. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = B*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = B*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3B - 1/2 => 3B = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => B = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute that again to confirm: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8.

Wait, no, let me write it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, reading the result from top to bottom: 8 7 5 2 4? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units place is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place is 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place is 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place is 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten-thousands place is 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 another way. 29524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous term. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is finite (nine layers), computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved explicitly. Let's see:\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, layer n=9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet's compute 59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5, write 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the sum is 88572. Okay, that's the same as before, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because each layer depends on the previous one, so if I messed up any of the earlier layers, it would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nLet me retrace my steps for each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each layer checks out. So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives us 88572, which seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the structure of the problem. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and then that result is added to 1 and multiplied by 3 again, and so on. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer.\n\nGiven that, the calculation seems correct. Each step is straightforward: multiply the previous result by 3 and add 1. So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and finally 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's see:\n\nFrom the inside out:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds a layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of \"1+3(...)\", so that would be 9 layers. Therefore, my calculation of 9 layers is correct, ending at Layer 9: 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since the numbers are manageable, computing each layer step by step is feasible.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). That's three layers. Let's compute that manually.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOutermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, computing step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nIf I compute it as per my method above:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120. Which matches. So, my method works for a smaller case, which gives me confidence that it's correct for the larger problem.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. After computing all nine layers, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524  \n\nMultiply Layer 9 by 3:  \n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it together: 8,8,5,7,2. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should compute it more carefully. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yeah, that seems right. So the final result is 88572. But let me verify my earlier steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer to ensure I didn't make any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Yeah, that seems to check out. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.

Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me try computing it another way. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a term that's 1 plus 3 times the previous. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 =1 +3=4. L_2=1 +3*L_1=1+12=13. L_3=1 +3*L_2=1+39=40. L_4=1 +3*L_3=1+120=121. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be written as L_n -3*L_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n -3*L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r-3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A -3*A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the value of the outermost expression before multiplying by 3 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express the entire original expression using the closed-form formula. The original expression is 3*(L_9)=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, the expression is (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's thorough enough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then double-checked using a closed-form formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer seems to follow the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is known. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, and then a particular solution is added. Alternatively, since the recurrence is of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the closed-form solution can be written as a_n = c*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant to be determined. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a1 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The closed-form solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition a1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. We need another equation to solve for A and B. Let's consider the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the closed-form, a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Comparing both expressions: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a9. So, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the closed-form formula. The original expression is 3*(a9), where a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the original expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I have.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer.\n\nBut since I've already computed each layer and confirmed the result with the formula, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*(Layer 9) again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n---------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5 *3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as:\n\n29524*3 = (30000 - 476)*3 = 30000*3 - 476*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, used a recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, and verified the result in multiple ways. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " So, starting from the right: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. But wait, that's not correct because 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572? Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression has 9 layers because it's 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine sets of (1+3). So, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly. Therefore, I think my answer is correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). How would that work?\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nLet me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*5) = 3(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Wait, but according to my step-by-step, I got 120. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, clearly, I made a mistake in my method. Wait, so my method is flawed. Let me see where I went wrong. In the smaller problem, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Then, moving out again, it's 1 + 3*(13) = 40. Then, the outermost is 3*(40) = 120. But when I compute directly, I get 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*5) = 3(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Wait, that's different. So my method is incorrect. So, where did I go wrong? Let me parse the expression correctly. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, in the smaller version, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 40. Then, the outermost is 3*(40) = 120. But when I compute directly, I get 48. Wait, that can't be. Maybe I'm miscounting the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. In the small problem: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3. Then, each layer adds another 3*(...). So, in the small problem, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, 1 + 3*(...) where ... is the inner expression. So, in the small problem, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, the outermost is 3*40 = 120. But when I compute directly, I get 48. So, clearly, my method is wrong. Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the layers. Let me write the small problem step by step: Compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute the innermost parentheses first: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, moving out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(40) = 120. But when I compute directly, I get 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Wait, so actually, both methods give me 120. But earlier, when I thought I got 48, that must have been a miscalculation. Let me check that again. If I compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) step by step: First, compute the innermost 1 + 3 = 4. Then, compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, compute the next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Finally, compute 3*40 = 120. So, both methods give me 120, not 48. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when I thought I got 48. Maybe I misread the expression. So, my method seems correct for the small problem. Therefore, going back to the original problem, my step-by-step computation should be correct, leading to 88572. But to be absolutely sure, let me compute the small problem again and see. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the final answer is 3*L_9. Now, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the final answer is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the computed value is 88572. So, my initial step-by-step computation was correct. The formula confirms that each layer L_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which for n=9 gives 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\(L_n\\) can be expressed as \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the innermost layer (n=1), this gives 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Calculating up to the ninth layer gives \\(L_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Assume a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(a_9), where a_9=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and even found a closed-form solution for the nested expression, which confirmed that the value of the innermost part is indeed 29524, leading to the final result of 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

So the result is 88572. Let me check that with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). This resembles a geometric series but nested. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a structure. Let's denote the innermost term as a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a9. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. What's the initial condition? When n=1, a1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but I feel like that's a big number. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have nine layers, perhaps there's a geometric series involved here.\n\nLet me think: Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved. Let's see:\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous part is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's consistent with the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed each layer step by step, I got Layer 9 as 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So both methods agree. So, that's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized this as a geometric series from the start. Let me try that approach as a third method to verify.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding it all out, the entire expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let's try expanding it a bit to see the pattern.\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's expand E step by step, but maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, E = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^{10} = 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048.\n\n59048 / 2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\n177147 - 3 = 177144.\n\n177144 / 2 = 88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, all methods lead to the same answer, which makes me confident that 88572 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are 9 layers.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let L_n be the value at layer n. The relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The solution to the recurrence is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute for n=9**: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I can add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n0 + 5 = 5, write down 5.\n9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1.\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Okay, that matches the multiplication result. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the earlier layers. Because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate one step and throw off the entire result. Let me go back through each layer and verify.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Sometimes these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar, which might offer a different approach. Let me see if that's possible here.\n\nLooking at the expression: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's consider the homogeneous solution. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nWait, that gives L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the particular solution would be a constant, which it is, but let's check if that works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try solving the recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^{6} - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: L_6 = (3^{7} - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: L_7 = (3^{8} - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: L_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly for each layer. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572, as we calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute it layer by layer or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result.\n\n3. Notice a pattern and derive a recurrence relation, then solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\n4. Use the closed-form expression to compute the final value without having to compute each layer manually.\n\n5. Verify the result using both methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also highlighted the importance of checking your work through multiple methods to avoid mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing a pattern and deriving a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form solution, confirming the result through multiple methods. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. Each time, the expression is 3*(...), so each layer adds a 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, I have:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, which is the outermost one before the initial 3.

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is computed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so maybe it's a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nWe can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier layer by layer. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The original expression is 3*(...), which is 3*a_9. Since a_9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving this recurrence leads to the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).

    "text": " So, let's write it as 29524. Multiplying each digit by 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 30000*3=90000, so 29524*3 should be just under 90000. But 88572 is less than 90000, which makes sense. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me try adding them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add digit by digit: 8 + 4 = 12, carryover 1. 4 + 2 = 6 +1=7. 0 +5=5. 9 +9=18, carryover 1. 5 +2=7 +1=8. 2 +0=2. So, it's 89052? Wait, that contradicts my previous result. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the number is 88572. But when I added 29524 three times, I got 89052. That's inconsistent, so I must have made an error in addition. Let me check the addition again: 29524 + 29524: 4+4=8, 2+2=4, 5+5=10, 9+9=18, 2+2=4. So, 29524 +29524=59048. Now, 59048 +29524: 8+4=12, carryover 1. 4+2=6 +1=7. 0+5=5. 9+9=18, carryover 1. 5+2=7 +1=8. 2+0=2. So, it's 88572. Wait, so the correct result is 88572. I must have miscalculated the addition before. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, the layers are correct up to Layer 9=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is Layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression using the formula I derived. Since each layer is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, and the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, so the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=3*(59049 -1)/2=3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nTo solve this recurrence, I can write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution will be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the expression inside is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same conclusion. It feels good to verify the answer using two different methods to ensure its correctness.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the solution is correct. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but breaking it down made it manageable. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence helped a lot in finding a more efficient way to compute the result without having to calculate each layer manually. So, in the future, if I encounter similar nested expressions, I can look for patterns or recurrence relations to solve them more elegantly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value of the nth layer. The recurrence is \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Closed-Form Solution**: Solving the recurrence gives \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer**: For \\(n=9\\), \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, starting from the units place: 4*3=12, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next:5*3=15, carryover 1. Next:9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. Next:2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it down: 87572? Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit:2*3=6 +1=7. Next:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next:2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572? Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit:2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit:5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8. So the digits are: 8 (from the ten thousands place), then 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), and 2 (units). So 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 30000 *3=90000, minus 476*3=1428, so 90000 -1428=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, did I count the layers correctly? Let me recount. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer1:4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So Layer2:1+3*4=13, Layer3:1+3*13=40, Layer4:1+3*40=121, Layer5:1+3*121=364, Layer6:1+3*364=1093, Layer7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} -1)/(c-1). Wait, but in this case, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so d=1 and c=3. Let me check. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to 3^9. Wait, let me see. Let me expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: (1 +3) =4. Then, 1 +3*(4)=1+12=13=1 +3*4. Then, 1 +3*(13)=1+39=40=1 +3*(1 +3*4)=1 +3 +3^2*4. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps each layer adds another power of 3. Let me try to expand the entire expression. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3s. Starting from the innermost: (1+3). Then each layer adds a 3*(...). There are 9 layers, so the innermost is 1+3, and each layer wraps around with 1 +3*(...).

Let me see:\n\nE=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me try to expand this expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me compute the innermost part first:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as follows:\n\nLet me define E9 = 1 +3\n\nThen E8 =1 +3*E9\n\nE7=1 +3*E8\n\nE6=1 +3*E7\n\nE5=1 +3*E6\n\nE4=1 +3*E5\n\nE3=1 +3*E4\n\nE2=1 +3*E3\n\nE1=1 +3*E2\n\nE=3*E1\n\nSo, starting from E9:\n\nE9=1+3=4\n\nE8=1+3*4=13\n\nE7=1+3*13=40\n\nE6=1+3*40=121\n\nE5=1+3*121=364\n\nE4=1+3*364=1093\n\nE3=1+3*1093=3280\n\nE2=1+3*3280=9841\n\nE1=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen E=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I keep arriving at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident enough that this is the correct answer.

    "text": " So, starting from the right: 4*3=12, 2*3=6+1=7, 5*3=15, 2*3=6+1=7, 9*3=27, 2*3=6+2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, just do the multiplication step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it all together: 8 7 7 5 2, which is 87752? Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, no, wait: Starting from the right, the digits would be:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7\n- Hundreds place:5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n- Thousands place:2*3=6 +1=7\n- Ten-thousands place:9*3=27 \u21927, carryover 2\n- Hundred-thousands place:2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing from the hundred-thousands to units: 8 (from 2*3 +2), then 7 (from 9*3), then 7 (from 2*3 +1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 +1), then 2 (from 4*3). So the number is 8 7 7 5 7 2? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 has 5 digits, so multiplying by 3 would give a 5 or 6-digit number. Wait, 29524 is 29,524. Let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 20,000 *3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 *3=27,000\n- 500*3=1,500\n- 20*3=60\n- 4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. So, 29,524 *3=88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let's go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572 (correct)\n\nWait, so that seems correct. Hmm, but I feel like maybe there's a pattern here that could have been recognized earlier, which might have saved some computation. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, if I let a_n be the nth layer, then a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each step. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1= (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. But let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents or the multiplications.\n\nWait, 3^10 is 59,049, correct. 59,049 minus 1 is 59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Multiply by 3: 29,524*3=88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59,049, so 3^11=177,147. Then, 177,147 -3=177,144. Divided by 2 is 88,572. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, used both iterative computation and a closed-form formula to arrive at the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows for a more efficient solution using a closed-form formula. The final result is obtained by calculating each layer step by step or by applying the derived formula directly.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate any of them.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, correct. So, I think I did it right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we derive a general formula for the nth layer, which simplifies the computation. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer's value by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, looking for a pattern, let's see if a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40.

Wait, let's see.\n\nIf we set a_0 =1, then a_1=1 +3*a_0=1+3=4, which matches.\n\nThen, a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1} can be written as a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we saw earlier.\n\nTherefore, the sum is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1, up to 3^n terms.\n\nBut since we have 9 layers, a_9 corresponds to n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result.

Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the number is 88572. Wait, but let me check 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Okay, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer to confirm. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1 + 3*a1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve for A and B. So, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} = A*3^n, and 3*B +1. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: A*3^n + 3B +1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B +1. So, -2B =1, which gives B= -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a1=4. a1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Which matches what I computed earlier. Good. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches the previous computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula also leads me to the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014computing step by step and using the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result. So, I think I'm done.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4.

So, after computing each layer, the final result is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n. Then, the total expression is 3*a_n.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let's try that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThus, the total expression is (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that matches the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making any miscalculations here. Let me compute 3^{11} again:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{11} is indeed 177147. Then, subtract 3 to get 177144, divide by 2 to get 88572.\n\nSo, both methods, the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, give the same result. That makes me confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each layer multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a base-3 expansion or something, but I think the recurrence approach is solid here.\n\nJust to recap, the process was:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each multiplication and addition.\n\n3. Notice the recurrence relation and derive a closed-form formula to compute the nth layer.\n\n4. Use the formula to compute the 9th layer, then multiply by 3.\n\n5. Verify the result using both methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested set where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n4. **Alternative method using recurrence relation**:\n   - The recurrence \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\) leads to a closed-form solution \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n   - For \\(n = 9\\), \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n   - Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, 29524 * 3: Let me write it out:\n\n   29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm this with another method, just to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nLet's add step by step:\n\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again: 3*3280.\n\n3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000 + 840 = 9840. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Wait, no: Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523, then +1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 is 88572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this problem is to recognize that it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's see:\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 should be 4.\n\n(3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3(...). There are nine such layers, right? Because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, and we have nine opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(...), which is 1+3*(1+3)\n\nThen, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on, up to nine layers.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I had Layer 1 to Layer 9, with Layer 9 being the outermost. So, n=9.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using both methods, step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we can compute each layer step by step or use a recurrence relation formula. Both methods lead to the same result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"
