    "text": " Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572, but let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1+3). Then moving out, each time we have another layer. So, the expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, when I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's correct, and then multiplied by 3. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in Layer 8. Let me check Layer 8 again. Layer 7 is 3280. So, 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I was computing the layers, I went from Layer 1 to Layer 9, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), so the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, you might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each step out adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each step adds another layer. So, the number of layers is 9, because each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and there are 9 of them. So, my initial computation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a sequence. Suppose a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (since the innermost layer is 1+3=4). Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate coefficients: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1 Therefore, B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is enclosed in parentheses. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another set of parentheses. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me count:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to the outermost. Let me see, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another \"1+3(\". Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, a_9 is indeed the outermost layer, which we computed as 29524, leading to the final answer of 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But given that we've already computed it step by step and verified with a general formula, I think 88572 is correct.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent every time I compute it. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, let's do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.

Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572, which is different. So I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me try that again carefully.\n\n29524\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28.

So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was doing the digit-by-digit, I think I misaligned the digits. So the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7     3\n\n--------\n\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15.

Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just go back through my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me list each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo each layer seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, a_1 is 4, as computed earlier.\n\nWait, but let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, the innermost layer, which is layer 1, is a_1=4, and the outermost layer, which is layer 9, is a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, since n=9, so 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*(59049 -1)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nWait, that's another way to compute it.\n\nSo, perhaps using the formula, I can compute it directly without computing each layer step by step. That might have saved time, but since I was just starting out, breaking it down step by step was a good approach.\n\nI think I've confirmed that the answer is 88572. To make sure, let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, a_2=1 +3*4=13\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40\n\na_4=1 +3*40=121\n\na_5=1 +3*121=364\n\na_6=1 +3*364=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, plus some constant. But the formula approach seems more efficient.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer equals 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Multiplication by 3:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, that seems to be the final answer.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think about it as a recurrence. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, in this case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which would be the Layer 9 value, 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer. So that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which again confirms the result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the computed value is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recurrence pattern, we can compute each layer step by step. Using the recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression, leading to a closed-form solution. Multiplying the final layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, multiplying by 3 at the end gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the expression is 3 times (Layer 9), which is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that could be solved using a formula instead of computing each layer. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Yep, that works.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods agree. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated and used in the next. After computing the ninth layer, the result is multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula for the recurrence relation, the final result is determined to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the result is 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572? Let me check with another method. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each layer isn't too bad. It might be similar to a geometric series or something, but in this case, since each term is 1 plus three times the previous term, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence, which is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it more efficiently, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me some time. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. I think this method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.

    "text": " So, let's write it as 2 9 5 2 4. Multiplying each by 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I multiplied 29524 by 3, I think I might have made a mistake in the digits. Let me write it out properly: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo putting it all together, starting from the right, we have 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me confirm with another method: 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nAdding 59048 + 29524:\n59048 + 20000 = 79048\n79048 + 9000 = 88048\n88048 + 524 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check the layers because I think I might have miscounted. The original expression has multiple layers, and I labeled them from 1 to 9. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, each layer corresponds to one set of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to verify my answer.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + b(...))) can often be expressed using the formula for a geometric series or through recursion. In this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3, L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also gives me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly counted the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs, excluding the initial 3. So, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1+3(...)), then another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3(...\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)) after the initial 3. So, my earlier calculation was correct, with 9 layers, each computed step by step. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} -1)/(k-1), but let me check that. Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, which has the solution a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} -1)/(k-1) if k \u22601. In this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} -1)/(3-1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, a_2=13, etc. Let me see if this formula works. Wait, perhaps I should adjust the indices. Let me define a_0 as the innermost term. Wait, in our problem, the innermost term is a_1 =1+3=4, then a_2=1+3*a_1=13, and so on up to a_9=29524. So, if I consider a_1 =4, then a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1} for n=2 to 9. So, the general solution would be a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Alternatively, solving the recurrence relation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)}=D.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nD -3*D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n= C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4= C*3^{1} -1/2 =>4=3C -1/2 =>3C=4 +1/2=9/2 =>C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nAt n=1, a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nAt n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nAt n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, that works. So, the general term is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost term is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer adds another a_n until a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check: For n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, we arrive at 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, starting from the innermost parentheses, each step adds another 3 multiplied by the previous term. Let me see how many terms there are. Since there are nine layers, each contributing a term, maybe the entire expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to see. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I expand this, each time I'm adding 3 multiplied by the next layer. Let me try to expand a few layers manually to see the pattern. Let's say I have a smaller version: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute this. Innermost: 1 +3=4. Then, 3*(4)=12. Then, 1 +12=13. Then, 3*(13)=39. Then, 1 +39=40. Then, 3*(40)=120. Then, 1 +120=121. Then, 3*(121)=363. Then, 1 +363=364. Then, 3*(364)=1092. Then, 1 +1092=1093. Then, 3*(1093)=3279. Then, 1 +3279=3280. Then, 3*(3280)=9840. Then, 1 +9840=9841. Then, 3*(9841)=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Then, 3*(29524)=88572. Wait, but I think I'm just going through the same steps again. Alternatively, maybe I can represent E as a sum of powers of 3. Let me think about it. Each time, I'm adding 3^k, but let's see.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that each layer adds a term that is 3^n. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 +1\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*(4) =1 +12=13=3^2 + 1 +3\n\nWait, 3^2=9, but 13=9 +4, which is 9 +3 +1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, let me try to see the expansion:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so expanding once: 3*1 + 3*3*(...). So, E = 3 + 9*(...). But the inner ... is the same expression with one fewer layer. So, if there are n layers, E_n = 3 + 9*E_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed each layer as L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, that's similar but not the same as E_n=3 +9*E_{n-1}.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the initial approach, each layer is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4.\n\nBut in the overall expression, E is 3*(L_9). So, E=3*L_9.\n\nGiven that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nSo, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent E as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLet me try to see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4=3 +1.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13=3^2 +1 +3.\n\nWait, 3^2=9, 9 +3 +1=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40=3^3 +1 +3 +9.\n\nWait, 3^3=27, 27 +9 +3 +1=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*(40)=1 +120=121=3^4 +1 +3 +9 +27.\n\nWhich is 81 +27 +9 +3 +1=121.\n\nWait a second, this seems to form a pattern where each layer's value is the sum of the first (n+1) terms of the geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0=1 up to 3^n.\n\nWait, for Layer 1: n=1, sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k =1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2, sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k=1 +3 +9=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3, sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k=1 +3 +9 +27=40. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n: L_n = sum from k=0 to n of 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWhich matches our earlier closed-form solution.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9: L_9= sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*L_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which is the same result as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it: the entire expression E is equal to (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as E= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step, recognizing the pattern, and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " So, let's write it as 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: Let's compute 29,524 * 3 step by step. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly, and sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me try computing a few layers again to confirm. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, all layers seem correct. Therefore, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. Let's assume a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, we have: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88,572. I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the process. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this.

Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. So, we can write this recurrence relation as Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. Let me rearrange it: Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. We have L1 = 4. So, substituting n=1: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct, matches L2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches L3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, matches L4=121. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, matches L5=364. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct, matches L6=1093. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct, matches L7=3280. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, matches L8=9841. For n=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, matches L9=29524. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n=9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*( (3^10 -1)/2 )= (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29,524, then 3 \u00d7 29,524 is indeed 88,572. But let me check if I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that's correct. Each layer is built correctly from the previous one. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication once more because sometimes when we carry over, we might make a mistake. Let me compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 in another way.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I computed Layer 9, I added 1 to 29,523 to get 29,524. But 3 \u00d7 9,841 is indeed 29,523, so adding 1 gives 29,524. That's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nBut let me think again: is there a pattern here that I can recognize? Because each time we're doing 1 + 3*(previous term), which is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Maybe there's a formula for such expressions.\n\nIn general, if we have an expression like a + 3*(a + 3*(a + ...)), it can sometimes be expressed using a formula. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for the nth term.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1\nLayer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1\n...\n\nSo, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis type of recurrence can be solved using the method for linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n = 1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1.\n\nn = 2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, matches Layer 2.\n\nn = 3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct, matches Layer 3.\n\nn = 4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct, matches Layer 4.\n\nn = 5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn = 6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn = 7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn = 8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn = 9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, matches Layer 9.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for Layer 9, the value is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using the formula. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(29524) = 88572, as we computed earlier.\n\nAlternatively, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*Layer 9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's another way to compute it, using exponents.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach the problem: recognizing the pattern, deriving the formula, and then computing it using exponents. That might be faster and less error-prone than computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work. However, knowing the formula is useful for future problems with similar structures.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and the repeating pattern.\n2. Compute each layer from the innermost outward.\n3. Alternatively, derive a formula using recurrence relations.\n4. Apply the formula to find the value of the outermost layer.\n5. Multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and everything seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and the repeating pattern. Each layer is computed by working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost outward:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but given that the expression is finite and only has nine layers, computing each layer step by step seems manageable. If I were to generalize this, it's similar to expressions where each term is built upon the previous one, leading to exponential growth, but since it's only nine layers, computing each is feasible.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. The expression inside is of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), which is similar to a geometric series but nested. However, since it's finite, the step-by-step approach is probably the most straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on up to f(9). Then, the total expression is 3*f(9). This recursive approach confirms the step-by-step method I used earlier.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute f(3) using the recursive formula: f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which matches Layer 3. Similarly, f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121, which is Layer 4. So, this recursive method is consistent with my earlier calculations.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that each layer is computed correctly, and the final result is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting with the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost one, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, perhaps it's 9 layers, meaning that the outermost layer is Layer9, which is 1+3*(Layer8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, the computation I did earlier is correct, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29524*3=88572.

Each layer builds on the previous one by adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which leads to a rapid increase in each step. It's a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable.

Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, finally, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute it more efficiently without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, the general formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_n, so 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, that's 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By recognizing this as a recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form solution.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer \\(L_n\\) can be computed using the formula:\n\\[ L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\(n = 9\\), the innermost layer \\(L_9\\) is:\n\\[ L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3 gives:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So, let me write it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits: 8 (from the ten-thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So yes, 88572.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that because if that's wrong, everything after that would be wrong. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841. So, 3*9841 = 29523, then plus 1 is 29524. That's correct. So, 29524 is correct for Layer 9. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing so quickly. Let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572 is the correct final answer.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. But sometimes, when we have nested expressions, especially with repeated multiplications, there's a formula we can use instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe that could be a quicker way or a way to verify the result. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression resembles a geometric series. Let me see if I can model it that way. The innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^n - 1)/(k - 1), where a_0 is the initial term.\n\nIn this case, k = 3, c = 1, and a_0 = 1 (since the innermost term is 1 + 3*1 = 4). Wait, actually, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1 = 4. Let me define the layers properly.\n\nLet me index the layers from 1 to 9, where layer 1 is the innermost. So, layer 1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, layer 2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, layer 3: a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to layer 9: a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nBut using the recurrence formula, maybe I can find a general expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, the expression becomes (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me see if that's the case.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nWait, let me check if each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1.\n\nLayer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 + 1 = 121. Correct.\n\nSo yes, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me think about that. The homogeneous solution would be A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant.\n\nSo, let's assume the particular solution is a constant C. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this with n=1:\n\n(3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 =364.

Correct.\n\nSo, that formula works. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1 =59048 /2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 -3=177144, then 177144/2=88572. That's the same as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula, which might have saved some time.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step correctly, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.

    "text": " Let me write it as 29524. So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that again: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check my layers again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the layers: The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times ...))). So, each layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., up to a_9=29524, as I did before. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 =0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the equation: A =1 +3*A => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2)=3C -1/2. So, 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have kept computing each layer step by step, which I did initially, and arrived at the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer, leading to the final result of 29524 for the innermost expression. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nWait, but let me count the layers again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me check: The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1+3), then Layer 2: (1+3*(Layer1)), up to Layer 9: (1+3*(Layer8)). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that's nine layers, each computed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1.\n\nSolving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all layers. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, so the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula up to Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3 * 29524 should be 88572. Let me check that with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.

Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, yes, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: When n=1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. Therefore, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I double-checked each step, and the alternative method using the recurrence relation also led to the same result.

So 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I get 88,572. But let me check if I computed Layer 9 correctly. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2192 Wait, I think I wrote 1093 earlier, which is the same as 1,093. So that's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, yes, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I wrote 29524, which is the same as 29,524. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88,572, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), each time wrapping another layer. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, I correctly reached 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is correct. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 \u2192 Layer 1\n\nThen, 1+3(Layer1) \u2192 Layer2\n\nThen, 1+3(Layer2) \u2192 Layer3\n\nContinuing until Layer9, which is the outermost.\n\nSo, the original expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit concerned because when I computed Layer9, I got 29,524, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88,572, which is a 6-digit number. Let me check if that's reasonable.\n\nWait, let me think about the pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is growing exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for it.\n\nLet me think: Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer9), and Layer9 is a_9, which is 29524. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the multiplication.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88,572, which is the same as 88572. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value of the original expression is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've double-checked each layer, used the formula for the recurrence relation, and confirmed the multiplication. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer n is given by (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time I see a \"1+3(\", so let me count them:\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, so that's nine layers of 1+3(...). But when I started computing, I did Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time wrapping another 3(...) around. So, my initial computation of nine layers is correct. So, each Layer i is 1 + 3*(Layer i-1), starting with Layer 1 as 1+3=4. Then, each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. So, the final Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me compute each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each time I compute a layer, I'm adding 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the sequence of layers is:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 4, and L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n, but since n is only 9, it's probably faster to compute each layer as I did before.\n\nBut just for fun, let me try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer using the formula I derived. For n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, each layer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added, it's a bit different. The formula I derived using the recurrence relation seems to be the right approach.\n\nIn conclusion, by working from the innermost parentheses outward and computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. I also verified each step and even derived a closed-form formula to ensure that my computations were correct.

But let me double-check my layer computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems to be computed correctly. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3: 20000 *3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not how you break it down. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Starting from the innermost: Each time you have 1+3, then each layer wraps around. Let me count the opening parentheses: There are nine sets of (1+3(...)), so that's nine layers. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed correctly. Therefore, the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88,572.

But let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let's go back step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using the formula derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find a_9 = 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers because maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers.\n\nLet me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about the layers, I considered the innermost as Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, the total number of layers is 9, each time going from the inside out. So, starting with 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), and so on, nine times. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3\n\nThen each layer wraps around it: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n\nThen the next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nAnd so on, until we have nine layers. So, yes, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again more carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is a_9, the value would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct, and the formula approach also leads to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer follows a pattern. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth layer. Let\u2019s denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p(n) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous result.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, it's a geometric series in disguise. But in this case, since each layer is built upon the previous, working step by step is straightforward and manageable, especially since there are only nine layers. I could have used the formula I derived, but stepping through each layer is just as efficient for a small number of layers.\n\nSo, to recap, the process was:\n\n1. Identify that the expression is a nested sequence of 1 + 3*(...).\n2. Start computing from the innermost layer, working outward.\n3. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n4. Once the outermost layer is computed, multiply by 3 as per the original expression.\n5. Verify the computations to ensure accuracy.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the inner layer into the outer one. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{expression})\\). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " So let me write it as 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: Let's compute 29,524 * 3 step by step. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,572. Hmm, let me check that again because 29,524 * 3. Alternatively, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, and 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Let me find B by considering the steady-state solution. If a_n = B, then B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition at n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution also leads me to the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more layers using the formula to see if it holds. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula is working as expected. Therefore, I can trust that a_9 is indeed 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because each layer seems to be increasing quite rapidly. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this computation easier, perhaps using geometric series or something like that. Maybe recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one.\n\nLet me define a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s say a_n is the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nThus, B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works for all layers up to n=9. That\u2019s reassuring.\n\nSo, the outermost layer is a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that using the formula. Since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute the result directly without going through each layer. That's much more efficient.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nThe problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer step by step, I found that each layer follows a geometric progression, which allowed me to derive a formula for the nth layer. Using this formula, I computed the outermost layer and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nYes, everything checks out. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations or reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By recognizing the pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the value of each layer. The nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all the layers check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all correct. So, 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the solution is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this expression as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more of a recursive expression. Each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on up to a_9 = 29524, as computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is the particular solution.\n\nTo find D, set a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D \u21d2 D - 3D = 1 \u21d2 -2D = 1 \u21d2 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way out. Finally, we multiply the outermost result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the carry-over. Let me do it step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

But let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*a, where a is the previous layer. So, each term can be represented recursively. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me consider that. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^{n} + D.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nSo, left side: C*3^{n} + D\n\nRight side: 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nEquate both sides:\n\nC*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1\n\nSo, D = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^{1} + D = 3C + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's another way to confirm the result.\n\nSo, through both iterative computation and using the formula for the linear recurrence, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct answer now. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this until the outermost layer is reached. Multiplying this final layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if any of the layers before that were miscalculated, it would throw off the entire result. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo each layer checks out. Therefore, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572, which should be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of expression, so I can verify it another way. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's a bit different because each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as S, where S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Alternatively, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me see if I can find a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where a_n represents the value at the nth layer. So, starting from the innermost layer, a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9, which is the outermost layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in our case, the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is 1 + 3*a_8, and so on. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant. Let me solve it step by step.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = K*3^{n}, where K is a constant.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = K*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = K*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3K - 1/2 \u21d2 3K = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 K = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, a_9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method using the recurrence relation confirms the result we obtained by direct computation. So, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. But since it's nested, each layer adds another power of 3. Let me see if I can express the entire sum as a geometric series.\n\nBut wait, in this case, each term is not just a simple geometric progression because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. However, using the recurrence relation method worked well, so perhaps that's the most straightforward approach.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer step by step and then using a recurrence relation to confirm, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))). This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, the value is a_n. Then, the original problem is 3*a_9, since the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, because there are 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I computed earlier. Then, the original expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've computed it step by step, checked each layer, derived a formula, and confirmed the result using two different methods. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds up to 29524 for the outermost parentheses. Finally, we multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe result of the computation is \\boxed{88572}."

Next:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 +3=4, correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with n layers. Here, n=9. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 =1 +3=4. a_2=1 +3*a_1=1 +12=13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, I notice that each a_n follows the recurrence relation a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in the initial condition: a_1=4= A*3^1 + B=3A + B. Also, let's see what happens when n=0. Wait, n starts at 1, so maybe it's better to consider the homogeneous solution. Alternatively, we can write the recurrence as a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K -3*K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 +1/2=3C => 9/2=3C => C= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Now, 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula confirms the result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute it without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recursively defined sequence. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n = 2, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to finding a_9 where a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Hmm, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works for the first few terms. So, using this formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again step by step.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. I even double-checked using the closed-form formula, which gave me the same result as computing each layer step by step. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. Each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me see:\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, it's like adding 1 and then tripling the previous total.\n\nBut I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nWait, another thought: If I have nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, except for the first step, which is just 1 + 3. So, maybe it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added constant each time. But I think the recurrence approach was sufficient.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead me to the same result, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. This pattern continues up to the ninth layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation, the ninth layer is found to be 29,524, and multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\n2. Multiply the ninth layer by 3:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"
