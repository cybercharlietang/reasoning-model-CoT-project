    "text": " Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply by 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524. 79048 + 9524: 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I started by identifying the nested structure and realized each layer depends on the previous one. I computed each layer from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9), each time substituting the value from the previous layer. After computing Layer 9 as 29524, I multiplied it by 3 to get the final answer, 88572. I double-checked the multiplication to ensure accuracy. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the value from the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that would be 877572? No, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is actually 88572. Let me check using another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500 20 \u00d7 3 = 60 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Ah, there we go. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I computed Layer 9 correctly because if that's wrong, everything else will be off. Let's go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2192 correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I think I might have made a mistake because 3*9841 is 29523, right? Let me check that: 9841 \u00d7 3.\n\n9841 \u00d7 3:\n\n- 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 5, carryover 2\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 9, carryover 2\n- (since there's no more digits, the carryover 2 becomes 2)\n\nWait, that would give 29523, right? 9841 \u00d7 3 = 29523. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try computing Layer 9 again just to be sure. 3*9841: 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 800 \u00d7 3 = 2400, 40 \u00d7 3 = 120, 1 \u00d7 3 = 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, yes, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier when I was adding up the layers, I thought 3*(Layer 9) would be 3*29524, but when I computed 29524 \u00d7 3, I initially made a mistake and then corrected it to 88572. So, I think that's correct.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and the computations check out. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure with nine layers. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find each layer's value and substitute it into the next until reaching the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 (correct)\n\nHmm, so I think my calculations are correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9 for the outermost layer.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, layer 1: 1 + 3, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1), ..., layer9: 1 + 3*(layer8). So, yes, layer9 is the outermost, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the expression as having 9 layers, each time adding another 3*(...), then the total number of multiplications by 3 is 9, but the initial 3 outside multiplies the entire expression. Wait, actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of times we multiply by 3 is 9, but the outermost is just multiplied by 3 once. Hmm, perhaps my initial approach was correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression can be represented as a geometric series with ratio 3 and 9 terms, but I think the recurrence relation approach is more straightforward here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. The formula for such a recurrence is indeed a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as I derived earlier.\n\nSo, with n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nI think this confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve it, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3 * 4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3 * 13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3 * 40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3 * 121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3 * 364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3 * 1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3 * 3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3 * 9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, did I compute each layer correctly? Let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, each layer builds upon the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like each step is following the formula: next_layer = 1 + 3 * previous_layer. That's a recursive formula, and it's interesting because each time, the value grows exponentially. I wonder if there's a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Maybe using a geometric series or something. Let me think about that for a moment. If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe it's easier to notice a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, since each term is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can expand it:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this expansion, we get:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*L_0\n\nBut wait, L_0 would be the base case. In our problem, L_1 is the innermost, which is 4. So, maybe L_0 is 1? Let me check.\n\nIf n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0. If L_1=4, then 4 = 1 + 3*L_0 => L_0 = (4 -1)/3 = 1. So, yes, L_0=1.\n\nTherefore, L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} ?\n\nWait, no, because when n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13? Wait, 1 + 3 is 4, plus 9 is 13. So, yes, L_2 = 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nBut wait, that's the sum of a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 *29524=88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct, and using the geometric series formula also gives the same result.\n\nI think I've got it. The key was to recognize the pattern and see that each layer can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3, which forms a geometric series. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series made the computation much faster, especially since calculating each layer step by step, while manageable, could be time-consuming for larger numbers of layers.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the geometric series pattern, I could have continued computing each layer manually, but it's good to see that both methods lead to the same answer. It also makes sense that the value grows so quickly because each layer is multiplied by 3, leading to exponential growth.\n\nIn summary, the problem involves recognizing a recursive pattern, computing each nested layer step by step, and then applying the final multiplication by 3. Using the geometric series formula is a more efficient method, especially for problems with many layers, but for this case with nine layers, either method works.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the outermost layer is (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 another way to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 7 7 5 7 2, but wait, that's from right to left. So the actual number is 88572. Yes, that matches.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 29,524, right? So, 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. So, 60,000 +27,000=87,000 +1,500=88,500 +60=88,560 +12=88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, maybe I can find a formula for the nth term in the sequence.\n\nLet me define a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 1 is a_1=4, Layer 2 is a_2=13, etc.\n\nSo, the general solution for such a recurrence is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a particular solution A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = 3/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula holds. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29524.

Wait, wait, that can't be because 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. Let me confirm with another method. 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. So 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So 29,524 * 3 = 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that checks out. So the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Layer 9 was 29,524, and then 3 times that is 88,572.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers are correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524. So 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. So starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is the first 1 + 3, and Layer 9 is the outermost one. So yes, Layer 9 is 29524, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(...), so yes, it's 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, giving 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll layers check out. So 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) eight times. So maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. So starting from the first ( after 3(1+3, that's Layer 1, then each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo the first 3 is outside Layer 9. Then inside that, there's 1 + 3*(...), which is Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(Layer 7), and so on until Layer 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I mislabeled the layers. Maybe the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, but the total number of layers is 9. So the computation I did earlier is correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about this is that each time you have a term like 1 + 3*(...), it's similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Maybe there's a formula for such expressions.\n\nIn general, expressions of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 computation earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is exactly the recurrence relation we used.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is built by nesting 1 + 3*(...) nine times, starting from the innermost. Each layer can be computed iteratively, or using the recurrence formula, leading to the same result.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer up to the ninth, we find that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gives us 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the iterative step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation method give the same result. So I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value inside the outermost parentheses and multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13  \n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40  \n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121  \n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364  \n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:  \n3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 88572. Wait, but that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524.

Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth layer. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute L_n into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3 step by step: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, we have 87,572.

Let me do it more carefully. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 87,572. But when I add 29,524 three times: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; 59,048 + 29,524: Let's add 59,048 + 29,524. Adding units place: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 +1=7, write 7. 0 + 5 =5, write 5. 9 +9=18, write 8, carry 1. 5 +2=7 +1=8, write 8. So, 59,048 +29,524=88,572. Wait, that's different from 87,572. So, my initial multiplication was wrong. So, where did I go wrong? Let's try again: 29,524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 =12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 =6 +1=7. Write 7.\n- Hundreds place:5 *3=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands place:2 *3=6 +1=7. Write 7.\n- Ten-thousands place:9 *3=27. Write 7, carry 2.\n- Hundred-thousands place:2 *3=6 +2=8. Write 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 87,572. But when adding, it's 88,572. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the addition. Let me try adding 29,524 three times:\n\nFirst addition: 29,524 + 29,524.\n\nLet's add 29,524 + 29,524:\n\n- Units:4+4=8\n- Tens:2+2=4\n- Hundreds:5+5=10, write 0, carry 1.\n- Thousands:2+2=4 +1=5\n- Ten-thousands:9+9=18, write 8, carry 1.\n- Hundred-thousands:2+2=4 +1=5.\n\nSo, 29,524 +29,524=59,048.\n\nNow, add another 29,524 to 59,048:\n\n59,048 +29,524:\n\n- Units:8+4=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens:4+2=6 +1=7.\n- Hundreds:0+5=5.\n- Thousands:9+2=11, write 1, carry 1.\n- Ten-thousands:5+9=14 +1=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Hundred-thousands:5+2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88,572.\n\nWait, so 29,524 *3=88,572, not 87,572. So where did I go wrong in my multiplication earlier? Let me check again:\n\n29,524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, that gives 87,572. But addition shows it's 88,572. So, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication. Wait, perhaps the initial computation of Layer 9 was wrong. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572. So, earlier, I must have miscalculated the multiplication. Let me try multiplying 29,524 by 3 again, more carefully:\n\n29,524\n\n*         3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\n5 *3=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n\n9 *3=27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 87,572. Wait, but addition shows it's 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check the addition again:\n\n29,524 +29,524=59,048.\n\n59,048 +29,524:\n\nLet's add digit by digit:\n\nUnits:8 +4=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nTens:4 +2=6 +1=7.\n\nHundreds:0 +5=5.\n\nThousands:9 +2=11, write 1, carry 1.\n\nTen-thousands:5 +9=14 +1=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nHundred-thousands:5 +2=7 +1=8.\n\nSo, total is 88,572.\n\nWait, so why is the multiplication giving me 87,572 and addition 88,572? There must be a miscalculation in the multiplication. Let me try another approach. Let's break down 29,524 *3:\n\n29,524 can be broken into 20,000 +9,000 +500 +20 +4.\n\nNow, multiply each part by 3:\n\n20,000 *3=60,000.\n\n9,000 *3=27,000.\n\n500 *3=1,500.\n\n20 *3=60.\n\n4 *3=12.\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60,000 +27,000=87,000.\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500.\n\n88,500 +60=88,560.\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nAh, there we go. So, the correct result is 88,572. Earlier, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I must have miscounted the carries or something. So, the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when I computed Layer 9, I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Therefore, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial multiplication, I thought it was 87,572, but now I see it's 88,572. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) nine times. So, it's a geometric series, perhaps. Let me see if I can model it as such.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1+3=4.\n\nSo, a_1=4.\n\na_2=1 +3*4=13.\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9=29,524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume B is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: B =1 +3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29,524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used a formula to confirm, and even used addition to verify the multiplication. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies this by 3 and adds 1. This process is repeated nine times. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find the value of the ninth layer to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe result of the computation is \\boxed{88572}."

Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add them step by step.\n\nFirst, add 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 + 4 = 8.\n\n2 + 2 = 4.\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write 0, carryover 1.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write 9, carryover 1.\n\n2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, 29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\nNow, add another 29524 to 59048:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that's the same as before, so it must be correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Maybe I should go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, I think I did it right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at each layer, each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the pattern is that each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using both methods\u2014direct computation and finding a closed-form formula\u2014I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a closed-form formula to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This forms a linear recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Linear Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **Find the Closed-Form Solution**:\n   - The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n   - The particular solution is found to be -1/2.\n   - Combining both, the general solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute for n=9**:\n   - a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that would be 88572. Let me check that again because I might have messed up the placement.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: positions are ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units.\n\nSo:\n\nUnits: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\nTens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\nHundreds: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\nThousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\nTen thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it from left to right: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me confirm by another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly computed Layer 9 as 29524. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes, so Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time there's a 1 + 3(...), so let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(...)\n3. 1 + 3(...)\n...\nUp to the ninth layer. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs, excluding the initial 3(...\n\nLooking at it, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and a parenthesis. Let's count how many times that happens.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer1)\nLayer3: 1 + 3(Layer2)\n...\nContinuing until Layer9, which is the outermost before the initial 3.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, my earlier calculation is correct, leading to Layer9 = 29524, and then 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I computed Layer9, I got 29524, but when I multiply by 3, I get 88572, which seems like a big number, but considering each layer is multiplied by 3 each time, it might be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that.\n\nIn general, for an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), if there are n layers, it's a recursive relation where each term is a + b*(previous term). So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define the terms as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote T(k) as the value of the k-th layer. So, T(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, T(k) = 1 + 3*T(k-1), for k >= 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the coefficients are constant, we can compute each term step by step, which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for such a recurrence is T(n) = (a - b)/(1 - b), but that applies when the recurrence is T(k) = a + b*T(k-1) with T(1) = a + b*T(0), and T(0) = 0. Wait, but in our case, the first term is T(1) = 1 + 3*1 = 4, so perhaps the formula is different.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as T(k) = 1 + 3*T(k-1), starting from T(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for such equations. The homogeneous solution is T(k) = C*3^k, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say T_p. So, T_p = 1 + 3*T_p \u2192 T_p - 3*T_p = 1 \u2192 -2*T_p = 1 \u2192 T_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is T(k) = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition T(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = 3/2. Therefore, T(k) = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for k layers, T(k) = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me test this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor k=1: T(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor k=2: T(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor k=3: T(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nFor k=4: T(4) = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, T(k) = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so T(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, T(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2192 which matches my earlier computation. So, Layer9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * T(9) = 3 *29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check using the formula. Since T(k) = (3^{k+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*T(9) =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572 \u2192 same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29524, which was 1 + 3*9841. Let me confirm that step because I might have made a mistake there.\n\nLayer 8 was 9841, so Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841 first. 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 8, I had 1 + 3*Layer 7, where Layer 7 was 3280. So, 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6, where Layer 6 was 1093. 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5, where Layer 5 was 364. 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4, where Layer 4 was 121. 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364.

Therefore, the final result after multiplying Layer 9 by 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The original problem is 3 times the entire nested expression. So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the layers.

So, I think I did it correctly.

So, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify by another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add them up:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Did I compute Layer 9 correctly? Because each layer depends on the previous one, and if I made a mistake in one layer, it would propagate through all the subsequent layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, all correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a pattern similar to 3^n + something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))), n times. Is there a general formula for that?\n\nYes, actually, in such cases, if you have a nested expression where each layer is of the form x = a + b*x, then the solution can be found using the formula for a geometric series or through recursion. Let me see.\n\nIn this problem, each layer is x = 1 + 3*x. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is defined by x_{k} = 1 + 3*x_{k-1}, with x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is x_n = (a*b^n - a)/(b - 1), where a is the constant term and b is the multiplier. Wait, let me recall the formula.\n\nFor a recurrence relation like x_n = a + b*x_{n-1}, the closed-form solution is x_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1). Wait, let me verify that.\n\nWait, let's consider the recurrence x_n = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write this as x_n - 3*x_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is x_n - 3*x_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution x_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is x_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition x_1 = 4:\n\nx_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this with n=1:\n\nx_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nx_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nx_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, in general, for the nth layer, x_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, x_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nThus, using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. So, starting from 4, each step is 3*previous +1. Wait, no, actually, each step is 1 + 3*previous, which is the same as 3*previous +1. So, it's a linear transformation: x_{n} = 3*x_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. The formula for such a sequence is indeed x_n = a*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where a is the initial term and r is the common ratio. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is x_n = 3*x_{n-1} +1, which is slightly different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for the sum of a geometric series with a multiplier. Let me think.\n\nThe expression x = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented as x = 1 + 3x, which leads to x = (1)/(1 - 3) = -1/2, but that's for an infinite series. However, in our case, it's finite, with 9 layers.\n\nSo, for a finite number of terms, the formula is x_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, but earlier, we had x_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me clarify.\n\nIn our case, starting from the innermost layer, which is x_1 =1 +3=4, and each subsequent layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, x_2=1 +3x_1, x_3=1 +3x_2, etc., up to x_9=1 +3x_8.\n\nThis can be represented as x_n =1 +3x_{n-1}, with x_1=4.\n\nUsing the formula for linear recurrence relations, as I did earlier, we found that x_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nThus, for n=9, x_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*x_9=88572.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways now, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each time you add a layer, you're effectively multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3 times the next layer plus 1. But since we're working from the inside out, it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step as I did earlier.\n\nLet me try to compute the layers again in a table format to ensure accuracy:\n\n| Layer | Calculation | Result |\n|-------|-------------|--------|\n| 1     | 1 + 3       | 4      |\n| 2     | 1 + 3*4     | 13     |\n| 3     | 1 + 3*13    | 40     |\n| 4     | 1 + 3*40    | 121    |\n| 5     | 1 + 3*121   | 364    |\n| 6     | 1 + 3*364   | 1093   |\n| 7     | 1 + 3*1093  | 3280   |\n| 8     | 1 + 3*3280  | 9841   |\n| 9     | 1 + 3*9841  | 29524  |\n\nThen, multiply Layer 9 by 3: 29524 *3 =88572.\n\nYes, this table confirms each step is correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me compute Layer 9 again:\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3 =60000\n\n9000 *3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method, 29524*3:\n\n29524\n\nx      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nAll right, I think I've checked this thoroughly. Each step is correct, and the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, the sequence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nYes, it works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^10 = 59049\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Expanding this, it's similar to 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3*3^9, but actually, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an extra 1 added each layer. Wait, maybe not exactly a geometric series. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is a sum where each term is 3^k, but with coefficients. Let me think recursively. Each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each term is 1 + 3*previous. So, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me denote S as the entire expression. Then, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) But the inner part is similar to S/3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can write S as 3*(1 + S'), where S' is similar but one layer less. Wait, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, since I already have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then S = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, S = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. This confirms the answer again.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and even using a formula derived from the recurrence, I consistently arrive at the same result: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Wait, that seems off because 3*29524: Let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to find a formula.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer follows the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWith a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, computing each a_n step by step as above is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can see if there's a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n -3a_{n-1}=0\n\nCharacteristic equation: r -3=0 => r=3\n\nSo, homogeneous solution: C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1\n\nSolving for A: A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2\n\nSo, general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C -1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 +1/2 =3C => 9/2=3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this method is more efficient because it uses the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, avoiding the need to compute each layer manually. However, since the number of layers is manageable, both methods work. The closed-form approach is especially useful if the number of layers were larger, saving time and reducing the chance of arithmetic errors.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could notice that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a geometric series or something similar. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a recursive formula. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since the innermost layer is layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...), so the outermost layer is layer 9. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought the digits were 2,7,5,7,8, but actually, the correct digits are 2,7,5,8,8, making it 88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another method. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, I must have made an error in my initial step-by-step multiplication, probably because I misaligned the digits. So, the correct final result after multiplying 29,524 by 3 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29,524, right? So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, that's the final answer. But let me just make sure that I computed each layer correctly because if I messed up any layer, the final answer would be wrong. Let me go back through each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2192 Wait, 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. But earlier, I wrote Layer 6 as 1,093, but in my initial computation, I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. So, that's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Therefore, 3 * 29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, when I multiplied 29,524 by 3, I thought I got 87,572, but that was a mistake. Upon correcting it, I see that it's 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this problem as a geometric series because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. If I denote the innermost expression as a_1 = 1 + 3, and then a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, up to a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2,187; 3^8 = 6,561; 3^9 = 19,683; 3^{10} = 59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just go through my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Each step follows from the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It looks like each layer is growing exponentially, which makes sense because each time you're adding 3 times a number that's already quite large. So, the numbers get big quickly, which is why the final result is over 80,000. I think I've done this correctly. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

So Layer 9 is 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 times (1 + 3(...)), and each time, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, right? Because each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had Layer 1 as 1 + 3, Layer 2 as 1 + 3*(Layer 1), etc., up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me compute it again just to be sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I compute the layers, I get Layer 9 as 29,524, and then 3 times that is 88,572. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))\n\nWait, so the outermost expression is 3 times the 9th layer. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by computing each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, we can compute each a_n step by step up to a_9, and then the final answer is 3*a_9.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nSo, that's the same result as before. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because the number seems quite large. Maybe I can check with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, let's compute a similar expression with only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, using the recurrence: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 3*a_2 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) \u2192 three layers.\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nUsing the recurrence: a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, then 3*a_3=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the method works for smaller numbers. Therefore, I can be confident that for nine layers, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer manually to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nCompute up to Layer 4:\n\na_1=4\n\na_2=13\n\na_3=40\n\na_4=1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, proceeding up to Layer 9 gives a_9=29,524, and 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, that's nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is built by adding 1 and three times the previous layer. So, the recurrence is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, but in this case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Hmm, no, actually, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 \u2192 B - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3*29524 should be 88572. Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8. So adding those: 40000 + 18000 = 58000; 58000 + 1000 = 59000; 59000 + 40 = 59040; 59040 + 8 = 59048. Now, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's break it down: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 500 = 88548; 88548 + 20 = 88568; 88568 + 4 = 88572. Okay, so that confirms that 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so each step seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a sequence. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n starts at 1 for the innermost parentheses. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, the same result. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for L_n. Let's see: Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant. Let's assume L_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10} directly and then apply the formula. But since I already have L_9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer using the formula. For example, L_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches. So, the formula works. Therefore, using the formula for L_9 is reliable. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So the result is 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, let's see: a1 = 4\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen, total = 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it generally. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3\n3^2=9\n3^3=27\n3^4=81\n3^5=243\n3^6=729\n3^7=2187\n3^8=6561\n3^9=19683\n3^10=59049\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the general formula approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nWe can find A using the initial condition.

Subtract 476 \u00d7 3 because 30,000 - 29,524 = 476. So, 90,000 - (476 \u00d7 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check each step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the layers correspond correctly. The original expression is 3*(...), and each layer is inside the previous one. So, the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2 is inside the next parentheses, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is inside the outermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P.\n\nSolving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's test for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, that formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\n3^10 is indeed 59,049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let's compute 243*243:\n\n243 * 200 = 48,600\n\n243 * 40 = 9,720\n\n243 * 3 = 729\n\nAdding them up: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. Correct.\n\nSo, 3^10 = 59,049, so a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n, but I think the formula I found using the recurrence is more accurate here.\n\nWait, actually, let me see. The expression a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}, and so on, until you get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n}*a_0, where a_0 would be 0 if we start from n=1.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4, so perhaps the formula is similar to a geometric series but with an extra term.\n\nWait, let me try expanding a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait a second, so each a_n is the sum of a geometric series up to 3^{n} plus 1. Wait, but that might not exactly fit because the initial term is 1, then 3, then 9, etc.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\n\nSo, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k} + something? Wait, no, because a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = sum_{k=0}^2 3^k = 13.\n\nWait, but the formula we found earlier was a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which for n=1 gives (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2, (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches. So, it's correct.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th term in the sequence defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nBut regardless of the approach, I keep getting 88,572 as the final result.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29,524 step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 87,572? Wait, no, wait, that can't be. Because when I write down the digits from right to left, it's 2, 7, 5, 7, 8, but that would be 87,572. But 29,524 * 3 is 88,572, right? Wait, maybe I messed up the digit positions.\n\nWait, 29,524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n4 (units) *3 =12 \u2192 units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 (tens) *3 =6 +1=7 \u2192 tens digit is7, carryover 0.\n\n5 (hundreds) *3=15 \u2192 hundreds digit is5, carryover1.\n\n9 (thousands)*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands digit is8, carryover2.\n\n2 (ten thousands)*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten thousands digit is8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the calculations, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recurrence relation, we compute each layer step by step. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Apply the Outermost Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. But let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations because if any layer is wrong, the final answer will be off.\n\nLet's go back step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let's count the number of layers. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nI think I correctly computed up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, I think my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.

So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 *3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + a(a + a(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me see if I can model this problem as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. Then, the recurrence relation is: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is built using the previous one. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n instead of computing each layer step by step. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is of the form L_n = A*r^n + B, where r is the common ratio and B is a constant term. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. First, let's write the homogeneous part: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since the expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. Given that L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. Here, n is 9, since each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, and there are nine sets. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let me denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function, since it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence of order 1. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_{k} = 3*a_{k-1}, which has the solution a_{k} = C*3^{k}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = C*3^{k} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for k = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier! So, a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, it's similar to expanding a geometric series. Let me see: Starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. Each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I unroll the recursion, a_9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9? Wait, no, that's not exactly correct because each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. Hmm, so it seems that a_k = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{k}. Let me check: For k=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1 = 4. For k=2, a_2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2. For k=3, a_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, yes, a_k = sum_{i=0}^{k} 3^i. Wait, but the sum from i=0 to k of 3^i is (3^{k+1} - 1)/ (3 - 1) ) = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula we derived earlier. So, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. That's a good consistency check. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or find the closed-form expression using the sum of a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, ultimately leading to the final value of 29524 before multiplying by 3. This results in the final answer of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me write it down:\n\n   29524\n*      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 8 8 7 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I got Layer 9 as 29524, which seems correct because Layer 8 was 9841, so 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original problem starts with 3*(...), so the outermost operation is multiplying the entire expression by 3. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me think again: is Layer 9 the innermost part? Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1), up to Layer 9, which is the outermost 1 + 3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9 as 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572, which would be the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1.\n\nSubtracting A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSo, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the total expression can be represented as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression step by step to see if I can represent it as a sum.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nBut 13 can be written as 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. So, Layer2 is 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nSimilarly, Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nBut 40 can be written as 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40? Let's check: 1+3=4, +9=13, +27=40. Yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nBut 121 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. Let's check: 1+3=4, +9=13, +27=40, +81=121. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer adds another term in the geometric series where each term is 3^{k} for k from 0 to n.\n\nSo, for Layer n, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nWait, but that's the sum of a geometric series, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the closed-form solution I found earlier.\n\nThus, for Layer9, a_9 = sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times. The answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the innermost value grows exponentially, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\), repeated nine times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nAnswer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, that would be 87, then 7, then 5, then 7, then 2? Wait, that can't be right. Let me do it step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. So, write 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, no carryover.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Wait, that would be 87,572? Let me check: 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\ntimes 3\n= ?\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 (from the ten-thousands place), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 87,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 * 3: Let me compute it another way to confirm. 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nAh, so that's 88,572. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 87,572. Let me see where I went wrong. When I was multiplying step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 7, 7, 8. Wait, that's 6 digits: 87,572. But that's not matching with the correct result of 88,572. Hmm, so I think I might have miscounted the digits when writing them down. Let me try again:\n\nAfter multiplying each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, no carryover.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, no carryover.\n- Ten-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carryover 2.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from the highest place to the lowest: 8 (hundred-thousands), 7 (ten-thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 87,572, but we know that 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the places. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, no carryover.\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, no carryover.\n- Ten-thousands: 9 * 3 = 27. Write 7, carryover 2.\n- Hundred-thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits as we go: 8 (hundred-thousands), 7 (ten-thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would make 87,572. But when I broke it down earlier, it was 88,572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3: Let me compute 29,524 * 3 using another method. 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048\n\n59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong in the multiplication? Let me check:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the digits are: 8 (from the hundred-thousands place), 7 (ten-thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, no, that can't be right because the ten-thousands place is 9, which is being multiplied by 3 to get 27, so we write 7 and carryover 2 to the hundred-thousands place. So, the hundred-thousands place is 2, which becomes 8 after adding the carryover. So, the number should be 87,572. But that contradicts the addition method, which gave 88,572. I'm confused now. Let me try to write it out properly with each step:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n1. Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n2. Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6. Add carryover 1: 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n3. Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n4. Thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6. Add carryover 1: 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5. Ten-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n6. Hundred-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6. Add carryover 2: 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the digits are written from the highest place to the lowest: 8 (hundred-thousands), 7 (ten-thousands), 7 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 877,572, which is way too high. But that can't be right because 29,524 is only 5 digits. So, I must be misaligning the digits.\n\nWait, no, 29,524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when we multiply by 3, we get a 5-digit number, but in this case, 29,524 * 3 is 88,572, which is a 5-digit number: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, where did I go wrong in the multiplication steps?\n\nLet me write it out vertically:\n\n       2 9 5 2 4\n     *         3\n     ------------\n       8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, that's 87,572, but we know it's supposed to be 88,572. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication steps.\n\nWait, let's go through each step again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1. Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n2. Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6. Add carryover 1: 7. Write 7.\n3. Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n4. Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27. Add carryover 1: 28. Wait, no, the thousands place is 9, right? Wait, no, in the number 29,524, the digits are: 2 (ten-thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying, we go from right to left:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. So, write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from left to right: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88,572. That's correct. So, earlier, I must have miscounted the places when I was writing the digits. So, the correct multiplication is 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with another method. Let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n= ?\n\nWe can break it down as:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but going back to the original problem, I think I might have made a mistake earlier in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in the intermediate steps.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was computing Layer 6, I wrote 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. That seems correct. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was trying to compute 29,524 * 3, I had confusion about the digits, but now I'm confident it's 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more by computing each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer. So, yes, nine layers, each time wrapping another 1 + 3*(...). So, I think I accounted for all nine layers correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4, then each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0, but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, for L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the solution can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients.\n\nWait, let me think. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: L_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, that works. So, the formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost layer is 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute each layer without having to go through each step, but in this case, since we only needed the 9th layer, it's more efficient to use the formula.\n\nAlternatively, if we didn't use the formula, we could have noticed the pattern in the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4\n\nLayer 2:13=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13\n\nLayer 3:40=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: (3^{10} -1)/2=29,524.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59,049, so 3^11=177,147.\n\nThus, (177,147 -3)/2=177,144/2=88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence.\n\nIn conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we find that the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1,093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 3,280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 9,841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 29,524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, actually, it's a recursive structure. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I did earlier. Then, f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to this recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution, say f_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, using the formula, I can compute it more efficiently without manually computing each layer. This confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can compute the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, add the carryover: 2.\n\nSo, writing the result from right to left: 2 (from 4\u00d73), then 7 (from 2\u00d73), then 5 (from 5\u00d73), then 7 (from 2\u00d73), then 7 (from 9\u00d73), and finally the carryover 2. So, the number is 87572. Wait, that's 5 digits: 8,7,5,7,2? Wait, no, because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be 88572, as per the earlier method.

So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, so in the digit-wise multiplication, I must have made a mistake. Let me try that again, more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNow, since we're done with all digits, add the carryover 2 to the left side.\n\nSo, the digits are: 2 (from 4\u00d73), 7 (from 2\u00d73), 5 (from 5\u00d73), 7 (from 2\u00d73), 7 (from 9\u00d73), and then the carryover 2. So, writing them together: 2, 7, 5, 7, 7, 2? Wait, that can't be right because that would make it 277572, which is 6 digits, but 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572, which is 5 digits. So, I must have messed up the alignment.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when multiplying by 3, each digit's product is added to the correct place. Let me try writing it out step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units place: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n- Ten-thousands place: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n- Now, since there are no more digits, we add the carryover 2 to the left of the current result.\n\nSo, the result is 2 (from carryover) followed by 7, 7, 5, 7, 2? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so when multiplied by 3, the result should be 88572.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just accept that 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572, as per the earlier calculation, and proceed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that each layer is a geometric series or something similar, but since the numbers are manageable, step-by-step computation seems feasible.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n=1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3n. But in this case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, so n starts at 1, then becomes 4, then 13, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ...))) with n layers, maybe there's a closed-form formula. But since I already have the step-by-step, maybe it's not necessary here.\n\nBut just for curiosity's sake, let me see if I can find a pattern or formula. Let's denote the value of k layers as L(k). Then, L(k) = 1 + 3*L(k-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation: L(k) = 1 + 3*L(k-1). The solution to this recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_h(k) = C*3^k, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(k) = C*3^k - 1/2. Using the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L(k) = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for k layers, L(k) = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with our earlier computations. For k=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor k=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor k=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for k=9 layers, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, which confirms our step-by-step result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the expression with nine layers is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(29,524) = 88,572. So, that's the final answer. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric series. Maybe I can express this recursively. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2,187; 3^8 = 6,561; 3^9 = 19,683; 3^10 = 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, using the closed-form solution, I also arrive at the same answer, which confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using a closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward approach. Another way to look at it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, and n=9. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + c/(r-1)) * r^{n-1} - c/(r-1), where c is the constant term and r is the common ratio. Wait, let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5.

That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition.

So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the outermost layer being 29,524.

So, 900+180=1,080 +12=1,092. Then, 1 +1,092=1,093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1,093=1 +3,279=3,280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3,280=1 +9,840=9,841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9,841=1 +29,523=29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9 where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, for n >=2, with L1=4. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see. The recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L1=4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L9=(3^10 -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, L9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that's consistent with our step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute L9 directly, which might have saved time. But since I was initially unsure, computing each layer step by step was a good way to verify that the process was correct. I don't think I made any errors in my calculations, but it's always good to double-check, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions. So, to recap: Each layer is computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that gives the next layer. Starting from 4, each subsequent layer grows exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which leads to rapid growth. This is why the numbers get so large so quickly. Using the formula, we can see that each layer Ln is equal to (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L9=(3^10 -1)/2=29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So, that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive formula, we can compute each layer step by step or apply a closed-form solution. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me write it properly:\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo reading from top to bottom, the result is 87, but wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a five-digit number. Let me do it again more carefully.\n\nActually, 29524 is five digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that would be 88,572? Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCalculate 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88,572. So the final answer is 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step again, or perhaps look for a pattern or formula that could represent this nested expression.\n\nWait, actually, this looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me think about that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, using the formula, I also arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression without breaking it into layers, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, I could use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit different. The formula I derived seems to fit here.\n\nWait, let me test the formula with the earlier layers to make sure it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works perfectly. So, using this, for n=9, we get a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88,572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
