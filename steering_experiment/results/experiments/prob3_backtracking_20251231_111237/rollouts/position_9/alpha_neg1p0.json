    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, I can count how many times the pattern repeats. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time it's 1 plus 3 times another expression. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 8 opening parentheses, so that means there are 8 layers to this expression. So, it's a nested expression with 8 levels. Maybe I can compute each layer starting from the innermost one. Let me write this out step by step. Let me denote each layer as follows: Let me start from the innermost part. Let's call the innermost expression E1. E1 = 1 + 3 Then, moving one layer out, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 Then, E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E8. Finally, the entire expression is 3*E8. So, if I can compute E1 through E8 step by step, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me start computing each layer one by one. E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Now, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Alright, moving on. E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Hmm, interesting. E5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 121, so E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 E6 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 E7 = 1 + 3*E6. E6 is 1093, so E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 E8 = 1 + 3*E7. E7 is 3280, so E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Now, the entire expression is 3*E8, which is 3*9841. Let me compute that. 3*9841: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me just multiply 9841 by 3. 9841 * 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, writing it down:\n\nStarting from the right:\n1*3 = 3\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n8*3 = 24 + 1 (carry) = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n9*3 = 27 + 2 (carry) = 29, write down 9, carry over 2.\nBut since there are no more digits, we just write down 29. So, putting it all together: 29,5,2,3. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me do it step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute 9841 * 3:\n\nFirst, 3 * 1 = 3\nThen, 3 * 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\nNext, 3 * 8 = 24, plus the carried 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2\nThen, 3 * 9 = 27, plus the carried 2 is 29, write down 9, carry over 2\nBut since there are no more digits, we add the carried 2 at the beginning.\n\nWait, actually, when we have 9*3=27 +2=29, so we write down 9 and carry over 2. But since there are no more digits, we just add the 2 before the 9, making it 29,5,2,3. Wait, that's not correct because the digits should be in order. Let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\nUnits place: 1*3=3\nTens place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry over 1\nHundreds place: 8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry over 2\nThousands place: 9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry over 2\nSince there are no digits beyond thousands place, we write the carried 2 before the thousands place.\n\nSo, the result is 29523.\n\nWait, let me check: 9841 * 3.\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nNow, add them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 29523.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen, 3*E8 = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the computations check out. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, I think the final answer is 29523.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is defined as E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4. By iteratively computing each layer up to E8, we find E8 = 9841. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{29523}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count how many times this nesting happens. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, is that right? Let me count: each time I see a \"3(\", that's a new level. So starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is one level deeper. Let me see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost part is just 1 + 3.\n\nWait, so how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3\n\nThen each layer adds another 3(1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd this continues until Layer 9, because the original expression has 9 layers of 3(...). Wait, let me check that again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)), and each of those is another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n\nThen each layer is built upon that:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer 1) \u2192 Layer 2\n\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer 2) \u2192 Layer 3\n\n...\n\nContinuing until Layer 9, because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, I can compute this by starting from Layer 1 and moving outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write this down as a sequence:\n\nLet\u2019s denote L1, L2, ..., L9 where each L is the value at that layer.\n\nSo,\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd the final result is 3*L9.\n\nSo, if I compute each L from 1 to 9, then multiply the final L9 by 3, I should get the answer.\n\nLet me start computing each layer step by step.\n\nFirst, L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, L2 is 13.\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, L3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to L4:\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL4 is 121.\n\nNow, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL5 is 364.\n\nNext, L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL6 is 1093.\n\nThen, L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL7 is 3280.\n\nProceeding to L8:\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL8 is 9841.\n\nFinally, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, L9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*29524. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, 3*29000 = 87000\n\nThen, 3*524 = 1572\n\nSo, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))). Hmm, let's count how many times the innermost part occurs. Starting from the innermost, there's a 1 + 3, then each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. I think there are nine layers here because each time I see a 1 + 3, and each is wrapped in another set of parentheses multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, let me check that again. The expression starts with 3(1 + 3(...)), and each time, inside the parentheses, there's another 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s multiplied by the parentheses. Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me try to parse it. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, again, 1 + 3*(next result). So, each time, we're adding a layer where we take the previous result, multiply it by 3, add 1, and then multiply that by 3 again, and so on. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way out. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each time, I'm taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving to the next layer. Let me write this down more systematically. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4  \nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nWait, but hold on. The original problem is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost expression is 3 times the entire nested part, which is L9. So, after computing L9 as 29524, the total result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's see: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3=88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7      3  \n---------  \nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5 *3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, the total expression equals 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating each L1 through L9. Let me go back and verify each step carefully.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nL4=1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.\n\nL5=1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nL6=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7=1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems accurate. Therefore, the outermost 3*(L9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, when I computed L9, that was the innermost part, and each subsequent L was adding another layer. So, after computing L9, the total expression is 3*(L9)=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. This looks like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. So, perhaps the general formula for such a nested expression with n layers is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, for example, with n=1, L1=4. Let's see: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=121. Formula: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost part is L1=4, which corresponds to n=1. Then, each layer adds another n. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is the result after 9 layers. Wait, but in our case, the expression is 3*(L9), but according to the formula, L9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation of L9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^11=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Which matches our previous result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. That's faster, especially for larger numbers of layers. But since I was able to compute it step by step, and both methods agree, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^11 manually to confirm.\n\n3^1=3  \n3^2=9  \n3^3=27  \n3^4=81  \n3^5=243  \n3^6=729  \n3^7=2187  \n3^8=6561  \n3^9=19683  \n3^10=59049  \n3^11=177147  \n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^11=177147. Then, 177147-3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Perfect, that's consistent.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost part outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer (L1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))) Let me count how many times this pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost part: 1+3 is the innermost, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, starting from the innermost, there are nine layers, right? Because each time it's 3 times (1 + ...), and the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next is 1 + 3*(previous), and so on, up to nine times. So, there are nine layers of this nesting. That might be a bit tedious, but perhaps there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Alternatively, since it's only nine layers, maybe computing each step one by one isn't too bad. Let me try that approach. I'll start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let's define each layer as follows: Let me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, E3, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost. So, E1 = 1 + 3. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1, E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9. Then the entire expression is 3*E9. Wait, but looking back at the original problem, the outermost term is 3*(...), and inside that is 1 + 3*(...), so actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*E9, where E9 is the innermost 1 + 3. So, let's start computing each E from the inside out. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Alright, moving on. E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, this is growing quickly. E5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 121, so E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6. E6 is 1093, so E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7. E7 is 3280, so E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, E9 = 1 + 3*E8. E8 is 9841, so E9 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 * 3. Let me do that step by step. 9000 * 3 = 27,000. 800 * 3 = 2,400. 40 * 3 = 120. 1 * 3 = 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 3*9841 = 29,523. Therefore, E9 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me go back through each step. E1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. E2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. E3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. E4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. E5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. E6: 1 + 3*364. Let me check 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. E7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. E8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. E9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9841*3. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; +120=29,520; +3=29,523. So, E9=1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct. Then the entire expression is 3*29,524. Let's compute that again: 29,524*3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; +1,500=88,500; +60=88,560; +12=88,572. So, yes, 88,572 is correct. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1=4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me write out the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula.\n\nE1 = 4\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nHmm, I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation of the form E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, with E1=4.\n\nI recall that for such linear recurrence relations, there's a closed-form solution. The general solution for E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b is E_n = a^{n} * (E0 + b/(a - 1)) - b/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. Wait, let me recall the exact formula. For a linear recurrence relation like E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, the closed-form solution is E_n = a^{n} * (E0 + (b)/(a - 1)) - (b)/(a - 1). But in our case, the recurrence starts at E1=4, so perhaps I need to adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The standard form is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, with E0 given. Then, the solution is E_n = a^{n} * E0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). So, in our case, a=3, b=1, and E0=4 (but E0 isn't actually given; our first term is E1=4). So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me see.\n\nIf I consider E1=4, then E2=3*E1 +1=13, which fits. So, the general formula would be E_n = 3^{n} * E0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, since E1=4, which is E0 in this case? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the indices. Let me think again.\n\nLet me define E_n as the nth term, starting from n=1. So, E1=4, E2=13, etc. Then, the recurrence is E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 1, for n \u2265 2, with E1=4.\n\nTo solve this, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say E_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u21d2 A - 3*A = 1 \u21d2 -2*A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition E1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify that. If E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, E1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, E2=(3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, E3=(3^{4}-1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the closed-form formula is E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, since we're dealing with E9, which is the 9th term, n=9:\n\nE9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each step. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each nested expression as \\( E_n \\) where \\( E_1 \\) is the innermost. The recursive relation is \\( E_n = 1 + 3E_{n-1} \\) with \\( E_1 = 4 \\).\n\n1. Compute each \\( E_n \\) step by step:\n   - \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( E_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times E_9 \\):\n   - Compute \\( 3 \\times 29524 \\):\n     - \\( 29524 \\times 3 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let's count how many times the \"1 + 3(...)\" part repeats. Starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count: 1. Innermost: 1 + 3 2. Next layer: 1 + 3(1 + 3) 3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) ... and so on. Wait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time I see a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count them: 1. 3(...) 2. 3(...) 3. 3(...) 4. 3(...) 5. 3(...) 6. 3(...) 7. 3(...) 8. 3(...) 9. 3(...) So, there are 9 layers of 3(...). But wait, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer, right? So perhaps each time I go out a layer, I add another 3(...). So, maybe there are 9 layers in total. Let me confirm by counting the number of 3(...) expressions. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 3(...). So, innermost is 1 + 3, then 1 + 3(1 + 3), then 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)), and so on until the outermost layer. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3s multiplied by the parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me try a different approach. Each time I have a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis, that's a new layer. So starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by the entire expression inside. Let me see how many times the pattern 3(1 + 3(...)) repeats. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost 3, which is just followed by 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me see: Each layer adds another 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each time we go out, we add another 3(...) around it. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to notice that the expression has 9 sets of \"1 + 3(...)\" starting from the innermost. So, let me work from the inside out. Let me define each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me call the innermost expression as a base case and then build outward.\n\nLet\u2019s start from the innermost part:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I counted the layers correctly. Let me recount the layers because I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, in the original expression, how many times does \"1 + 3(...)\" occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of times \"3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each 3 inside is another layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\" instances.\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n3. Continuing, each time we have another 3 followed by (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n- The outermost 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Inside that, another 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Repeating this, how many 3s are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, in the expression, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9, because each \"3(\" introduces a new layer. Wait, let me count them:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each time we have a new \"3(\", so let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 \"3(\" instances. But the innermost part is 1 + 3, which doesn't have another \"3(\", so perhaps there are 8 layers? Wait, no, because each \"3(\" starts a new layer, so if there are 9 \"3(\", that would mean 9 layers. But let me think: starting from the outermost, each \"3(\" introduces a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, then inside that, another 3, and so on, until the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. So, how many layers?\n\nLet me try to index them:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would make sense. So, 9 layers, each defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me recast my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, in my initial calculation, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, but let me confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet me go through each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let's compute 3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. I thought there were 9 layers, but let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, let's count the number of 3s inside the expression. Each \"3(\" introduces a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many \"3(\" are there?\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside another set. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 \"3(\" instances. But the innermost is 1 + 3, which doesn't have another \"3(\", so maybe it's 8 layers? Wait, no. Because each \"3(\" starts a new layer, so if there are 9 \"3(\", that would mean 9 layers. But let me think: starting from the outermost, each \"3(\" starts a new layer, so the outermost is Layer 1, then inside that is Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9. But when I computed earlier, I had Layer 1 as the innermost, which might be conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should index the layers differently. Maybe I should start from the outermost as Layer 1, and work inward. Let me try that approach.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things because each layer depends on the inner one. So, perhaps it's better to start from the innermost as Layer 1 and work outward. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 13.\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, which is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. Let me see: the original expression has 9 sets of \"3(...)\" starting from the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n3. Continuing this, each time we have another 3 followed by (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of \"3(\" instances.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a new \"3(\", so let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 \"3(\" instances. So, that would mean 9 layers. Therefore, my initial calculation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try to write out each layer with their corresponding values.\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer builds upon the previous one, and the calculations check out. So, the final value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and the arithmetic seems correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", starting from the innermost. By calculating each layer step by step from the inside out, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Layer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, if I start from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), that seems manageable. Let me compute that first. Innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) Now, the next layer out is (1 + 3(4)). Let me compute that. First, compute the 3(4) part, which is 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. So, replacing that, the expression is now: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))))) Next layer out is (1 + 3(13)). Let me compute 3(13) first: 3 * 13 = 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40))))))) Next layer: (1 + 3(40)). Compute 3*40: 120. Add 1: 121. So now, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))) Next layer: (1 + 3(121)). Compute 3*121: 363. Add 1: 364. So, replacing that, we have: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))) Next layer: (1 + 3(364)). 3*364 is... let me compute that. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1093. So, replacing that, the expression is now: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093)))) Next layer: (1 + 3(1093)). Compute 3*1093: Let's see, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Add 1: 3280. So now, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(3280)) Next layer: (1 + 3(3280)). Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Add 1: 9841. So, replacing that, the expression is: 3(9841). Finally, compute 3*9841. Let me do that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, the final result is 29523. Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Then (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Then (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Then (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Then (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, 3*9841 = 29523. Hmm, that seems consistent. Each step, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1. So, each time, it's like a geometric progression. Wait, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ...)), it's similar to a continued fraction or a geometric series. Maybe I can represent it as a recurrence relation. Let's denote each term as x_n, where x_1 = 1 + 3, x_2 = 1 + 3x_1, x_3 = 1 + 3x_2, and so on, up to x_9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, starting with x_1 = 4, then x_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, x_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on until x_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9. So, if I can find a general formula for x_n, that might make it easier instead of computing each step manually. Let's see. The recurrence relation is x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is x_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. When n=1, x_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. So, 3A + B = 4. For n=2, x_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substituting back into 3A + B = 4: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: x_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: x_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: x_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, x_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, but earlier I got 29523 as the final result. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check where I went wrong. Wait, the entire expression is 3*x_9, right? So, if x_9 is 29524, then 3*x_9 would be 88572. But that contradicts my earlier step-by-step calculation which gave 29523. So, something's wrong here. Let me double-check the formula. Wait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. The expression is 3*(x_9), where x_9 is the innermost term. Wait, no, actually, the way I defined x_n, x_1 is the innermost (1+3), and x_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, in my earlier step-by-step, I computed up to x_9 = 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. But according to the formula, x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, so 3*x_9 would be 88572, which is way larger. So, clearly, I have a mistake in my formula application. Let me see where I messed up. Wait, in my initial definition, I considered x_1 = 1 + 3, which is correct. Then x_2 = 1 + 3x_1, which is also correct. So, the recurrence is correct, and the general formula is x_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, x_9 should be (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. But in my step-by-step, I ended up with x_9 = 9841, which is different. Wait, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. Let's count the number of layers: The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds one more. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, because the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)) with 9 layers of 3(...). Wait, actually, the number of layers is 9, because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, x_1 is the innermost, x_2 is the next, up to x_9. So, x_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. Therefore, according to the formula, x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. But wait, in my step-by-step calculation, I ended up with 29523, which is different. So, there's a contradiction here. I must have made a mistake in either the formula or the step-by-step. Let me check my step-by-step again. Let me list each step with the corresponding x_n: x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 x_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 x_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 x_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 x_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 x_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 x_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 x_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 x_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, x_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I stopped at x_9 = 9841 and then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. That was incorrect because I miscounted the number of layers. Actually, the expression has 9 layers, so x_9 is 29524, and the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. So, where did I go wrong in my initial step-by-step? Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a new (1 + 3(...)). Let's see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let's count them: 1. (1 + 3) 2. (1 + 3(...)) 3. (1 + 3(...)) ... up to 9 layers. So, x_1 to x_9 correspond to each layer. Therefore, in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to x_9 = 9841, but that's actually x_8, because I started counting from x_1 as the innermost. Therefore, I missed one layer. So, I need to compute one more layer beyond x_9 = 9841. Let me correct that. So, after x_8 = 9841, the next layer is x_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the correct answer should be 88572, not 29523 as I initially thought. So, I made a mistake in the number of layers, stopping one step too early. That's why the formula gave a different result. So, to correct it, I need to compute one more layer. Let me redo the step-by-step with the correct number of layers. Starting from x_1 = 4 x_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 x_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 x_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 x_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 x_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 x_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 x_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 x_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. I think that makes sense now. So, the key was to recognize the pattern, define the recurrence relation, find the general formula, and then apply it correctly. Alternatively, by carefully counting the number of layers and computing each step, I arrive at the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of times we have a 3 multiplied by a sum that includes another 3. Alternatively, maybe it's better to approach it as a recursive expression, where each term is defined in terms of the next one.

Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which would be a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen the next layer out would be a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since the expression is nested 9 times. Wait, let me confirm: starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3, then each layer adds another a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so after 9 layers, we'll have a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but let me count the number of layers.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nWait, actually, each 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, so let's count how many 3( are there after the initial one.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and each time we go out a layer, we add another 1 + 3*(...). So the number of layers is equal to the number of times we can nest this structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define a_1 as the innermost expression:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer, we have:\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so a_9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9, so:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*29524:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to compute 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing a_9. Let me go back through the steps:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. Because sometimes when you count layers, it's easy to miscount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 \u2192 layer 1\n\n2. 1 + 3*(layer 1) \u2192 layer 2\n\n3. 1 + 3*(layer 2) \u2192 layer 3\n\n...\n\nContinuing until layer 9, which is the outermost layer inside the initial 3.\n\nYes, that's correct because the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3. So, each layer corresponds to one of those. Therefore, a_9 is the value of the innermost expression, and the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me write out the expression step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 layer 1\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 layer 2\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 layer 3\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 layer 4\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 layer 5\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 layer 6\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 layer 7\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 layer 8\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 layer 9\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the value is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but when I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, that's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), right? So, yes, 9 layers, so a_9 is 29524, and 3*a_9 is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check if I did the multiplication correctly for each a_n:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression by expanding it step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me substitute into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1\n\n-2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThus, the solution is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it using both step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula, and both give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each nested expression as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\) and each subsequent term is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let me count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times a similar expression. Let me see: 1. Innermost: (1 + 3) 2. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result of innermost)) 3. Then: (1 + 3*(result of previous)) 4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1. Starting from the left, the first term is 3, then 1 + 3(...). So, each time I go into another set of parentheses, the count increases. Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as a series of nested expressions, each one being 1 + 3 times the next one. Let me try to write this down step by step, starting from the innermost part. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost. So, L1: (1 + 3) L2: 1 + 3*L1 L3: 1 + 3*L2 ... and so on, up to L9, because I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first 3, then each (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times the 1 + 3(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost, each layer is one more 3*(...). So, perhaps there are nine layers? Let me check: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is L1: (1 + 3) Then L2: 1 + 3*L1 L3: 1 + 3*L2 L4: 1 + 3*L3 L5: 1 + 3*L4 L6: 1 + 3*L5 L7: 1 + 3*L6 L8: 1 + 3*L7 L9: 1 + 3*L8 Then the outermost is 3*L9. So, in total, there are nine layers, from L1 to L9, each built upon the previous one. Therefore, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from L1 up to L9, and then multiply the final result by 3. Okay, let's start computing each layer.\n\nStarting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me do it again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot, but let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with so many layers.\n\nStarting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression is a geometric series of sorts, where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value at the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet\u2019s solve it.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write the homogeneous solution as L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. At n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*L_9, and since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches our previous result.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we can compute the result directly without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's pretty efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad, but it's good to know the general formula in case the number of layers increases.\n\nSo, in summary, by recognizing the pattern and either computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation formula, we arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize it as a nested pattern where each layer is defined by \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\).

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let me count how many times the pattern repeats. Each time, there's a 1 plus 3 times another expression. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a (1 + ...). Starting from the innermost: \n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result of 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result of 2)\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are nine layers here because each time I see a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...). Wait, let me check: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 has a corresponding closing one, and I can see that there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so I think there are nine layers. That means I need to compute this expression from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and working my way up. So, let me start with the innermost part first. Let me write down each step as I compute each layer. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each innermost expression as E1, E2, ..., E9, where E1 is the innermost, and E9 is the outermost. So, E1 = 1 + 3. Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. E3 = 1 + 3*E2. And so on, up to E9 = 1 + 3*E8. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9. So, let me compute each Ei step by step.\n\nStarting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572, so total is 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through each step again.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so total is 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, E6=1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nE7=1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, E7=1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE8=1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So, E8=1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE9=1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3. Let me break it down:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523.\n\nSo, E9=1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me compute 29524*3 digit by digit.\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. I assumed there are nine layers because each time there's a (1 + 3(...)), but let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach (1 + 3(...)) adds a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The next (1 + 3(...)) is the next layer, and so on.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)).\n\nStarting from the first 3, it's followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is the first layer.\n\nThen inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let me see: starting from the first 3, then each (1 + 3(...)) adds a new layer. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first (1+3(...)) is the first layer, then each subsequent (1+3(...)) is another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nI can see that there are nine (1 + 3(...)) terms, each nested inside the previous one. So, from E1 to E9, as I defined earlier, which means I have nine layers to compute. So, my initial approach was correct, and I computed up to E9 correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations.\n\nE1 = 4\n\nE2 = 13\n\nE3 = 40\n\nE4 = 121\n\nE5 = 364\n\nE6 = 1093\n\nE7 = 3280\n\nE8 = 9841\n\nE9 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*E9 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the next inner layer. We compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:  \n   \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n2. Use \\( E_1 \\) to compute the next layer:  \n   \\( E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times E_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:  \n   \\( E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times E_2 = 40 \\)  \n   \\( E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times E_3 = 121 \\)  \n   \\( E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times E_4 = 364 \\)  \n   \\( E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times E_5 = 1093 \\)  \n   \\( E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times E_6 = 3280 \\)  \n   \\( E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times E_7 = 9841 \\)  \n   \\( E_9 = 1 + 3 \\times E_8 = 29524 \\)\n\n4. Finally, multiply by 3:  \n   \\( 3 \\times E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nHmm, let me count how many times this pattern repeats. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Let's see: starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), and then each layer adds another 3 times (1 + ...). So, starting from the inside:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 3 multiplied by that result. So, 3 * 4. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows to keep track:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait a second, let me check that again because I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so actually, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers to compute. Let me recount to make sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer out: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n3. Next: (1 + 12) = 13\n4. Next: 3*13 = 39\n5. Next: 1 + 39 = 40\n6. Next: 3*40 = 120\n7. Next: 1 + 120 = 121\n8. Next: 3*121 = 363\n9. Next: 1 + 363 = 364\n10. Finally: 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, but the original problem only has 9 sets of parentheses, so perhaps I'm counting one extra layer. Let me look again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), each time we add another layer. Let's see how many layers there are. Each time you open a new parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are 9 opening parentheses, each followed by a 1 + 3(...). So, that means we have 9 layers to compute. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12\n3. Layer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\n4. Layer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39\n5. Layer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 1 + 39 = 40\n6. Layer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120\n7. Layer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 1 + 120 = 121\n8. Layer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363\n9. Layer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 1 + 363 = 364\n10. Finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nWait, but that seems like 10 layers, but the problem only has 9 sets of parentheses. Maybe I'm overcounting. Let me think again. Each time I have a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), that's a layer. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4, then each time moving outward, adding 3*(previous result). So, perhaps the correct number of layers is 9, which would make the final result after 9 layers. Let me try that again, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nLet me number the layers correctly. Each time, I'm dealing with 3*(1 + ...), so each layer is a 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n9. Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, that seems different from my previous calculation. So, perhaps I was miscounting earlier. Let me verify this step by step.\n\nWait, in my first approach, I was starting with (1 + 3) as Layer 1, then 3*(Layer 1) as Layer 2, but maybe that's incorrect because each 3*(1 + ...) is a layer, so each time, the inner expression is (1 + previous layer). Let me try to write it more clearly.\n\nLet me define each layer properly:\n\nLet\u2019s denote L1 as the innermost layer.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + the previous layer). So:\n\nL2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the result is 36084. Therefore, the final answer would be 36084. But let me check this because my initial approach was giving me 1092, which is way too small, so I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me look at the original problem again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, it's 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as each parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Therefore, I need to compute 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, but in my second approach, I ended up with 36084 after 9 layers. Let me confirm this step by step again.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, after 9 layers, the value is 36084.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought it was 10 layers, I got 1092, which is clearly wrong because the problem only has 9 layers. So, 36084 must be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think if there's a pattern or a geometric series involved here.\n\nEach time, the expression is of the form 3*(1 + previous term). So, each layer can be seen as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value after n layers. Then, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, after 9 layers, it's 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see:\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me write out the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThis seems to follow a pattern where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Wait, let me check:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3a_{n-1}\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3K + 3 => K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3C - 3/2 => 3C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n})/6 - 3/2.\n\nSimplify further:\n\n11*3^{n}/6 = (11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to leave it as is.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 divided by 6: 19683 /6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 *11 = let's compute 3280.5 *10 = 32805, plus 3280.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084.\n\nYes, that's consistent with our earlier step-by-step calculation. So, a_9 = 36084.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check my initial approach where I thought it was 1092. That was because I was counting one extra layer, perhaps. But upon reevaluating, I see that the correct number of layers is 9, leading to 36084. So, I think 36084 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 3, but that's not exactly accurate because each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, it's a bit different. But the recurrence relation approach seems solid.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with 9 layers, each of the form 3*(1 + previous layer).

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with 1 + 3(...). Let me count them to be sure. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), that's the first layer. Then moving outward, each time, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside and moving outwards. Let me try that approach. Let's denote each layer as follows: Let\u2019s define the innermost expression as Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 20,000 *3 = 60,000. 9,000*3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 24*3=72. So adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the total would be 88,572. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me verify to make sure I didn't make a calculation error somewhere. Let me check each layer step by step again. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524=88,572. Let me compute 29524*3 again to be sure. 29,524 *3: 20,000*3=60,000. 9,000*3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60,000 +27,000=87,000. 87,000 +1,500=88,500. 88,500 +72=88,572. Yep, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 *3 directly: 29,524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29,524 *3=88,572. Correct. So, all the layers seem to compute correctly, and the final result is 88,572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me try to see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 +3=4, a_2=1 +3a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me try to find a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So, homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K. Solving for K: K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4=3C -1/2. Solving for C: 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1, a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the layer we need, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^{10}=59,049. Therefore, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches the value I computed earlier for a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that confirms the result using a different method, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outward.

Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define each nested expression recursively. Let me call the innermost expression E1, then the next one E2, and so on, up to E8 or something. Wait, maybe that's a good idea. So, let's define E1 as the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, the next layer out is E2 = 1 + 3*E1.\n\nThen, E3 = 1 + 3*E2.\n\nAnd so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is E8 = 1 + 3*E7.\n\nWait, how many layers are there?

Starting from the first 1+3, then each subsequent 1+3(...) is nested inside. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, perhaps it's 8 layers? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n6.

So, E1 is the innermost, E2 is next, up to E8, and then the entire expression is 3*(E8). So, I can compute each E from E1 to E8 step by step. Let's start computing each E:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(E8) = 3*9841. Let me compute that.\n\n3*9841: Let me compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2.\n\n8*3=24 + 2 = 26, write down 6 and carry over 2.\n\n4*3=12 + 2=14, write down 4 and carry over 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4.\n\nSo, writing it down: 9841 * 3 = 29523. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 29,523.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E8.

Correct.\n\nThen 3*9841 = 29,523. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 29,523. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to see if there's a quicker way, in case I made a mistake in computing each step.\n\nLooking at the structure, each E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for E(n).\n\nThe general form for such a recurrence is E(n) = a*E(n-1) + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is E(n) = a^(n) * E(0) + b*(a^(n) - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but in our case, E1=4, so maybe E(n) = 3^n * E0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) *1, but I need to adjust the indices correctly.\n\nWait, actually, let's think about it. The recurrence is E(n) = 3*E(n-1) + 1, with E(1)=4.\n\nTo solve this, the homogeneous solution is E_h(n) = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found as a constant, say E_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is E(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition E(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: E(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula works. Therefore, E(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have E8, which is (3^9 -1)/2. Wait, because n=8, so E8 = (3^{9} -1)/2.\n\n3^9 is 19683, so E8 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(E8) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. I can also check the number of layers. Since each E(n) corresponds to one layer, and we have E1 to E8, that's 8 layers, which matches the original expression. So, I'm confident that the answer is 29,523.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each nested expression follows the pattern E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), starting with E1 = 4. Using the closed-form formula E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find E8 = 9841. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).\n\n2. **Define the recurrence relation**: Let E(n) represent the nth nested expression. Then, E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E1 = 4.\n\n3. **Compute each E(n) step by step**:\n   - E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n4. **Apply the closed-form formula**: E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=8, E8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*E8 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{29523}$"

Starting from the innermost part, each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", so let's count them:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. Continuing this way, I think there are nine layers of nesting here because each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Wait, let me check again. Each time I see a new set of parentheses, so starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Hmm, actually, each 3(...) is followed by another 3(...), so perhaps there are nine layers of 1+3(...). Let me confirm by counting the number of \"1+\" terms. Each time, a new \"1+\" starts, so starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3, so that's nine times. So, nine layers. That means I need to compute each layer starting from the innermost one and work my way outwards. Let me write down each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out:\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer out:\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nContinuing:\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but I thought there were nine layers, but let me check if I counted correctly. Each time I go out a layer, I'm adding another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1 as the innermost, each subsequent layer is one more. So, if I have nine layers, I should compute up to layer 9, and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but when I look at the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so after computing up to layer 9, which is 29524, I then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, the outermost 3 multiplies the entire expression inside. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me represent the problem as a series of nested expressions, each time starting with 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the number of layers is how many times \"1 + 3(...)\" appears. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Each \"1+\" is followed by a \"3(...)\", so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(layer 1), which is layer 2.\n3. Next, 1 + 3*(layer 2) is layer 3.\n4. Continuing this way, each time adding a new layer.\n\nWait, so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+\" expressions. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time a new \"1 + 3(...)\" is added. Let's see: starting from the innermost, each time we have a \"1 + 3(...)\", so how many times does that happen? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3(, there are 8 instances of \"1 + 3(\" before the innermost 1+3. Wait, let me count:\n\nStarting from the beginning: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3(, each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the first 3(. So, starting from the first 3(, then inside it's 1 + 3(...), and inside that, another 1 + 3(...), etc. So, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" occur after the first 3(?\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. inside that: 1 + 3(\n3. inside that: 1 + 3(\n4. inside that: 1 + 3(\n5. inside that: 1 + 3(\n6. inside that: 1 + 3(\n7. inside that: 1 + 3(\n8. inside that: 1 + 3(\n9. inside that: 1 + 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times. So, that would mean there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), up to layer 9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). So, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9), so:\n\nFinal result = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24.\n\nWait, better to compute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 4 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n3 * 5 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if I have the correct number of layers. I thought there were 9 layers, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the first 3(. Each \"1 + 3(\" represents a new layer.\n\nStarting from the first 3(, the next is 1 + 3(, then inside that another 1 + 3(, etc. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3(. So, after 3(, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, the next is 1 + 3(, then another 1 + 3(, and so on until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3(. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. Then inside that: 1 + 3(\n3. Then inside that: 1 + 3(\n4. Then inside that: 1 + 3(\n5. Then inside that: 1 + 3(\n6. Then inside that: 1 + 3(\n7. Then inside that: 1 + 3(\n8. Then inside that: 1 + 3(\n9. Then inside that: 1 + 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times. So, that would mean 9 layers of 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my initial computation was correct, with 9 layers leading up to 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's accurate. Let me recount the layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, each layer can be expressed as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved as follows.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution + particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: solve L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nCharacteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 \u2192 r = 3.\n\nSo, homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, which also matches. Good.\n\nSo, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The problem is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the first 3(. Each \"1 + 3(\" corresponds to a new layer.\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then inside it's 1 + 3(...), which is the first layer. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...), which is the second layer, and so on until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many \"1 + 3(\" are there? Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" after the first 3( is a new layer. So, let's see:\n\n1. After the first 3(, we have 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 1\n2. Inside that, 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 2\n3. Inside that, 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 3\n4. Inside that, 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 4\n5. Inside that, 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 5\n6. Inside that, 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 6\n7. Inside that, 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 7\n8. Inside that, 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 8\n9. Inside that, 1 + 3( \u2192 layer 9\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 9, which we computed as 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nWait, but I think my approach is correct. Each layer is computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives the correct result.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Layer 1: 4\n- Layer 2: 13\n- Layer 3: 40\n- Layer 4: 121\n- Layer 5: 364\n- Layer 6: 1093\n- Layer 7: 3280\n- Layer 8: 9841\n- Layer 9: 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from the innermost part, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(1+...). Let me see: 1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Then: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Continuing: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Then: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me check: Starting from the innermost, each time I'm moving outward, so that's 9 layers. Wait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, which is the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, maybe I should count how many times I'm doing this operation. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me denote each step as S1, S2, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost. So:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nS2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(S9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the innermost part. So after calculating S9, which is 29524, we then multiply by 3.\n\nSo the final result would be 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do the multiplication step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was going through the layers, I ended up at S9 as 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But when I first thought through the layers, I went up to 88573, which was my 10th step, but I think I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, so let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nFrom the expression, each \"1 +\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. Let's count the number of \"1 +\" sections.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), that's the first layer.\n\nThen each layer wraps another (1 + 3(...)), so each additional layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the first 3(, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, no, perhaps it's 9 layers in total because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, so let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds one, so let's count:\n\n1. After 3(, first ( is layer 1: 1 + 3(...)\n\nThen inside that, another ( is layer 2, and so on until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers in total, meaning S1 to S9 as I did before. So, S1 = 4, S2 = 13, S3 = 40, S4 = 121, S5 = 364, S6 = 1093, S7 = 3280, S8 = 9841, S9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought through, I thought of 10 layers, but perhaps that was a mistake. Wait, let's recount.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by expanding the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Let's try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, after that, we have the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3 times this outermost layer. So, the outermost expression is 3*(88573) = ?\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure. The structure is 3*(...), where ... is 1 + 3*(...). So, after computing the innermost, we go outwards, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, after the ninth layer, we have 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524, and then the next layer is 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573, but wait, that would be the tenth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, the first ( is 1 + 3(...), then each subsequent ( adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, each ( corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. After 3(, first ( is layer 1.\n\nThen inside that, another ( is layer 2.\n\nContinuing, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. So, starting from the first ( after 3, each new ( adds another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))))) So, the first ( is layer 1.\n\nThen inside that, another ( is layer 2, and so on until the ninth (.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers, so S1 to S9, as I did before, leading to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did the earlier expansion, I went up to 88573, which would be the result of 1 + 3*29524, which is 88573, and then the entire expression is 3*88573, which would be 265719, but that seems too high.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confusing the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the expression as having 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), each nested inside the previous one, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, perhaps my earlier confusion was because I thought there was an extra layer, but actually, it's 9 layers, each computed as above, leading to 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a geometric series.\n\nIn this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe closed-form solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - (c)/(k-1).\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the standard solution for a linear recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n-1} + k^{n-2} + ... + k^0)\n\nBut in our case, a_1 = 4, so perhaps a_0 would be (a_1 - c)/(k) = (4 - 1)/3 = 1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach it differently.\n\nLet me try to compute the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nn: 1, a_n: 4\n\nn: 2, a_n: 13\n\nn: 3, a_n: 40\n\nn: 4, a_n: 121\n\nn: 5, a_n: 364\n\nn: 6, a_n: 1093\n\nn: 7, a_n: 3280\n\nn: 8, a_n: 9841\n\nn: 9, a_n: 29524\n\nWait, these numbers look familiar. Let me see if they follow a pattern. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nSo, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify once more by computing step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))). Hmm, so there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with 1 + 3(...). Let me count them: starting from the innermost, that's 1+3, then each time we add another layer. So, let's denote each layer as a step. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s call the innermost expression Layer 1, then the next one Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9, since there are nine layers. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer one by one, I can build up the solution. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down: 29524*3. 29524 times 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\nThen, 9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that each step was correct because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a calculation error somewhere. Let me go back through each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*29,524: Let's compute that again. 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. Each digit multiplied by 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that can be generalized, so I don't have to compute each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. This is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model this with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we saw in Layer 1. Then, each subsequent term is built by this relation. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis kind of recurrence relation can be solved using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find the general formula for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation for Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, this method confirms the result without having to compute each layer step by step. It's useful because if the number of layers were larger, say n layers, we could compute the result using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nIn this problem, since there are 9 layers, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can directly compute the result without computing each layer, which is efficient.\n\nBut in this case, since the number of layers is manageable, both methods work fine.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is essentially 3^{n} multiplied by some factor, but the recursive approach with the formula seems the most straightforward.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. By expanding from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step, and eventually, we find that the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer method and the recurrence relation method give the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let me see: 1+3 is the innermost, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)), and each time, it's another 1 + 3(...). Let me see, starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) is layer 1. Then, moving out, each layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s outside each parenthesis. The innermost is (1 + 3), then 3*(that), then 3*(next), and so on. Let me see: the innermost is (1 + 3). Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3). Then the next is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. Wait, perhaps I should count the number of 3s outside each parenthesis. Let me try to parse the expression step by step. The entire expression is 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let me write it down step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each nested expression as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say E1 is the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving out, E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nThen, E3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on, until E9, since the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, let me check: the innermost is (1 + 3), which is E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is (1 + 3*E1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is E2\n\nThen, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me make sure I counted correctly. Let me recount the layers. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is E1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers? Let's see: from the innermost, each layer adds a 3*(...), so the number of layers is 9, because there are 9 sets of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and there are 9 such layers.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\nE1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check for n=1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have E9, since there are 9 layers.\n\nSo, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just confirm once more to be sure. I've done the calculations step by step, and the formula also gives the same result, so I think it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed sequentially. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed as E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). The \"something\" is another 3 multiplied by another (1 + something else), and this repeats nine times, I think. Let me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the left, I see a 3, then inside that, another 3, and so on. Let me count: 3(1 + 3(...)) So that's one 3. Then inside, another 3, so that's two. Continuing like this, I think there are nine layers of 3s. So, maybe I can compute this by starting from the innermost part and working my way out, calculating each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost parentheses. The innermost part is (1 + 3). So, let's compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that expression. So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3). Wait, no, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, so the next layer out would be 3*(1 + 4). Wait, no, let me clarify. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, the layer just outside that is 3*(1 + 4). Wait, no, that's not correct because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + the next inner expression). So, perhaps I should work from the inside out, computing each step as I go. Let me try writing it down step by step. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Wait, no, that can't be right because the next layer is 3*(1 + L1). Wait, but in the problem, each layer is 3*(1 + the next inner layer). So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Then, L3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Wait, but let me check that again because I might be making a mistake here. Let me think: Each layer is 3*(1 + the previous layer). So, starting from L1, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, L2 is 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Then, L3 is 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. L4 would be 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. L5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. L6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. L7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. L8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. L9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Wait, but let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Let me try a smaller version to see if the pattern holds. Suppose I have only two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let's compute this. Innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. So, the two-layer version gives 15. Now, if I compute it as per my steps above, L1 = 4, L2 = 15, which matches. Now, let's try three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. So, yes, that's correct. So, the pattern seems to be that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Therefore, proceeding step by step as I did above, I get to L9 = 36084. But let me verify each step carefully because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic when dealing with large numbers.\n\nLet me write down each step clearly:\n\n1. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n3. L3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n4. L4 = 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n5. L5 = 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n6. L6 = 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n7. L7 = 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n8. L8 = 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n9. L9 = 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, so that seems correct. Let me double-check each multiplication:\n\n- L1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEach step seems correct. Now, another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's clear that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost, then a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nFirst, let's write down the recursive formula:\n\na_1 = 4 (since 1 + 3 = 4)\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) for n > 1\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution, a_n^p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 3\n-2*A = 3\nA = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n4 = 3C - 1.5\nAdd 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3C\nC = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \u2248 1.8333...\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 - 3/2\n\nBut let me see if this formula holds for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1)/6 - 3/2 = (33)/6 - 3/2 = 5.5 - 1.5 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSimilarly, for n=2:\n\na_2 = (11*3^2)/6 - 3/2 = (11*9)/6 - 1.5 = 99/6 - 1.5 = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27)/6 - 1.5 = 297/6 - 1.5 = 49.5 - 1.5 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, so the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9)/6 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9 first:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683)/6 - 3/2\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n11*19683 = let's compute 10*19683 + 1*19683 = 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n216,513 \u00f7 6 = let's compute:\n\n6*36,000 = 216,000, so 216,513 - 216,000 = 513.\n\n513 \u00f7 6 = 85.5\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 85.5 = 36,085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 = 1.5:\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches the step-by-step computation earlier. So, the result is 36,084.\n\nWait, so that's consistent. So, the answer is 36,084.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the arithmetic.\n\nLet me recompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196,830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19,683\n\nAdding them together: 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n216,513 \u00f7 6: Let's compute 6*36,000 = 216,000, so 216,513 - 216,000 = 513.\n\n513 \u00f7 6: 6*85 = 510, so 513 - 510 = 3, which is 0.5 more. So, 85.5.\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 85.5 = 36,085.5.\n\nSubtract 1.5: 36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where each layer is 3 more than a multiple of 3, but I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe each layer is following a pattern where a_n = 3^{n+1} - 3/2, but let me check.\n\nWait, from the formula I derived, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nWait, let me see if that can be rewritten differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor 3 out.\n\nWait, let's see: (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6.\n\nBut 3^{n} / 6 = (3^{n}) / (3*2) ) = 3^{n-1}/2.\n\nSo, (11*3^{n}) /6 = 11*3^{n-1}/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 -3)/2 = (8)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*3^{1} -3)/2 = (33 -3)/2 = 30/2 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*3^{2} -3)/2 = (99 -3)/2 = 96/2 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works too. So, perhaps the formula can be written as a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^{8} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^8 = 6561.\n\nSo, 11*6561 = let's compute:\n\n10*6561 = 65,610\n\n1*6561 = 6,561\n\nAdding together: 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171.\n\nNow, subtract 3: 72,171 - 3 = 72,168.\n\nDivide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's consistent as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 36,084.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it using both the step-by-step approach and the formula, and both give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let me count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3, then each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and this repeats. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, starting from the left, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me see: the first is 3(...), inside that is another 3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of 3s outside the parentheses. There are nine 3s multiplying the inner expressions. So, that means there are nine layers of nesting. Therefore, I need to compute this starting from the innermost layer and work my way out. Let me write down each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3 multiplied by the result of Layer 1, plus 1. So, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving out another layer, Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, okay, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4 result) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5 result) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9's result. So, the final step is:\n\nTotal = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3 times 29524. Let me break that down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the total value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that because that seems like a big number. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to check.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final multiplication: 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the total is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without going through each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step isn't too bad.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might help. Let me see.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. Let me find C.\n\nAssume a_n = C is a constant solution. Then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the explicit formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9.\n\nTherefore, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the explicit formula. That's probably more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I was able to compute it step by step, and both methods gave me the same result, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula and see if they match.\n\nFor layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for these layers, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for layer 9 as well.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe recognize that each layer is of the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with the innermost layer being \\( a_1 = 4 \\). We compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4.

Starting from the innermost, each time I see a 1 + 3(...), so let's see: 1. Innermost: 1 + 3 2. Then, 1 + 3*(result of 1) 3. Then, 1 + 3*(result of 2) 4. And so on, until we reach the outermost 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first layer is 3(...), then inside it is 1+3(...), which is the second layer, and so on. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a term: Each time we have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. Let me confirm: Starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so the total number of layers is 9. Therefore, I need to compute this expression starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me write down each step, starting from the innermost. Let me define each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost. So, S1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, S2: 1 + 3*(S1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. S3: 1 + 3*(S2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. S4: 1 + 3*(S3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. S5: 1 + 3*(S4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. S6: 1 + 3*(S5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. S7: 1 + 3*(S6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. S8: 1 + 3*(S7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. S9: 1 + 3*(S8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the outermost expression is 3*(S9). So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from S1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. S2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. S3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.

Let me see: starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), and then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another: (1 + 3(...))\n4. Continuing this way, I think there are nine layers of 3(...) before the outermost 3(...). Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the expression, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. Next, (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me parse the expression correctly. Let me rewrite it with each layer:\n\nThe entire expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So let's think recursively. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, since there are nine layers of 3*(...).\n\nWait, actually, looking at the expression, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, we have to multiply it by 3.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer 1: 4\n\nThen each layer is built by adding 1 + 3*(previous layer). So:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but is Layer 9 the innermost? Wait, let me check again. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, since the expression has nine layers of 3*(...), starting from the innermost, we have Layer 1 to Layer 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, (1 + 3*(...))\n3. Each time, we have another layer.

Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3): Layer 1\n- Next layer: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)): Layer 2\n- Then: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)): Layer 3\n- Continuing until Layer 9, which is the outermost (1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n- Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the innermost (1 + 3), each layer is another (1 + 3*(...)), so let's count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3): Layer 1\n2. (1 + 3*(Layer 1)): Layer 2\n3. (1 + 3*(Layer 2)): Layer 3\n4. (1 + 3*(Layer 3)): Layer 4\n5. (1 + 3*(Layer 4)): Layer 5\n6. (1 + 3*(Layer 5)): Layer 6\n7. (1 + 3*(Layer 6)): Layer 7\n8. (1 + 3*(Layer 7)): Layer 8\n9. (1 + 3*(Layer 8)): Layer 9\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, we have 9 layers, each built upon the previous one.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nFirst, compute 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000, but wait, 29524 is 29000 + 524\n\nSo, 3*29000 = 87000\n\n3*524: Let's compute 3*500 = 1500, 3*24=72, so total 1500 + 72 = 1572\n\nSo, 87000 + 1572 = 88572\n\nWait, but that's not correct because 3*29524 is actually 88572.

Let me go back through each layer to check for any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the original expression, after the innermost (1 + 3), each layer is 3*(...), so when we compute each layer, we have to make sure that each step is correct. Let me check Layer 8 again: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\nLooking at the expression, each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so the total number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression has 9 layers of 3*(...), starting from the innermost.

Then, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, no, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\n- (1 + 3): Layer 1\n\n- Then, each \"1 + 3(\" after that adds a new layer.\n\nSo, the expression after the first 3* is:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the first \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3*, there are 8 more layers, making a total of 9 layers.\n\nWait, that's 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just list each layer as I did before:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem is only 9 layers deep, computing each step manually is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found as follows:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nYes, as we've verified for n=1,2,3, it works. So, for n=9, it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the computation is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting with the innermost layer as (1 + 3) = 4. By iteratively computing each subsequent layer, we find the value at each step until reaching the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we confirm the value at each layer, leading to the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))) So, there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with 1 + 3(...). Let me count them: the innermost one is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that with another 1+3(...). So, starting from the inside, I can compute each layer one by one. Let me write down each step as I go along. Let's start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Then, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. So, 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 364 times 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, adding those together: 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, adding those: 9000+600=9600, plus 240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000+27000=87000, plus 1500=88500, plus 60=88560, plus 12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with so many layers. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might form a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to generalize it. Let's denote the innermost term as a1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1. Similarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9. So, each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=4. So, we can write a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as before. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4. So, when n=1, a1=4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))). Each time, we have a term that's 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, if I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 3^9*1, but wait, no, because each term is nested inside the previous one. So, actually, each layer adds another power of 3. Let me try expanding it step by step. Let me denote E as the entire expression. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers. Let me see, if I expand the innermost layer first, it's 1+3=4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4=13. Then, the next is 1 + 3*13=40, and so on. As I did before, so each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, the entire expression can be represented as E = 3*a9, where a9 is the ninth term in the sequence defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. So, as I found earlier, a9=29524, so E=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express E as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that. Let me write out the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost term:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, E = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=4, as I did before, and using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which for n=9 gives a9= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, so E=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try that. If I expand the expression, each 1 inside the parentheses contributes a term multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers it's nested within. So, for example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, because it's inside eight layers. Wait, let me think. Let me try to see the expansion.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3s multiplied to each 1. The innermost 1 is in Layer 9, so it's multiplied by 3^8, because each layer adds a multiplication by 3. Wait, let me see: the first 1 is in the innermost Layer 9, which is multiplied by 3^8, because it's inside 8 layers of multiplication by 3. Then, the next 1 is in Layer 8, multiplied by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is in Layer 1, multiplied by 3^0=1. So, the total expression would be E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) = 3*(sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k). Wait, no, because each 1 is at a different level. Wait, perhaps E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) can be expanded as 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1, but that doesn't seem right because each layer is nested, so the exponents would be higher.\n\nWait, let me try to see. Let's start expanding the expression step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nLet me expand it layer by layer, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to express E as a sum, each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the number of times it's nested. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, because it's inside eight layers. The next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0=1. So, E would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) = 3*(sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k). Wait, but that sum would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=8, the sum is (3^9 -1)/2. Then, E = 3*(sum) = 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ) = (3^{10} -3)/2. Wait, but 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523. But that's not matching the earlier result of 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*(sum) where sum is (3^9 -1)/2 would be 3*(364) = 1092, which doesn't make sense because our earlier calculation was much larger. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I'm expanding it.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each time we add a layer, we're adding another 3^k term. So, the entire expression E is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers. So, when we expand it, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1 multiplied by 3^0. So, the sum would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, and then multiplied by 3, so E = 3*(sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ). But 3^9 is 19683, so (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841, then 3*9841=29523, which is different from our earlier result of 88572. So, this approach is giving me a different answer, which suggests that I'm making a mistake in how I'm expanding the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that each time we have a layer, it's not just adding 3^k, but it's adding 3^k multiplied by the entire expression of the next layer. So, maybe the expansion isn't as straightforward as a simple geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula I derived earlier using the recurrence relation is the correct approach. So, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a1=4, and we found a9=29524, then E=3*a9=88572, which seems consistent with the step-by-step computation.\n\nSo, perhaps the confusion comes from trying to represent it as a geometric series, which might not capture the nesting correctly. Each layer is dependent on the previous one, so it's more accurate to model it as a recurrence relation, leading to the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, with n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524, and E=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer, and my initial step-by-step calculation was accurate.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, plus 1500=88500, plus 60=88560, plus 12=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. \n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me write it out step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me denote each inner expression as E1, E2, E3, etc., starting from the innermost.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nSo, starting from E1, I can compute each E step by step.\n\nLet me compute each E:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E9, so:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression equals 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check the multiplication another way.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, same result. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute E9 again to ensure that I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdd them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThen, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can represent this nested expression, so I can compute it without having to go through each step manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or using recursion.\n\nLooking at the expression, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = E_n^h + E_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, E1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, let's check if this formula holds for n=1:\n\nE1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nE2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nE3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works.\n\nSo, for E9, n=9:\n\nE9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, E9=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but each term is added inside the multiplication.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )).\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation was more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to recognize that each E_n is one more than three times the previous, which is exactly the recurrence we solved earlier.\n\nSo, to wrap up, after computing each step carefully and verifying with a formula, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). Starting from the innermost term, we compute each layer step by step.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - E9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the final result by 3**: The entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let me count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Let me try to parse this step by step. Maybe I can represent each nested part as a separate equation and solve them one by one, starting from the innermost. Let's denote each nested part as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me try to define it recursively. Let\u2019s suppose that the innermost expression is E\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then the next layer out would be E\u2082 = 1 + 3E\u2081. Then E\u2083 = 1 + 3E\u2082, and so on, up to E\u2089, since I count nine layers of nesting. Wait, let me check that. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). So maybe it's E\u2081 to E\u2089. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. There are 9 sets of 1+3(...). So that would mean 9 layers, so E\u2081 to E\u2089. Wait, no, maybe it's 8 layers because each 3(...) is a new layer. Let me try to visualize it again.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous expression). Let me count how many times this happens. Let me write it down step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me number each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears in the expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 1+, each subsequent 1+ is nested deeper. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 1+3(...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost part is 1+3.\n\nSo how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Each \"1+\" is followed by an opening parenthesis, so let me count how many times \"(\" appears after \"1+\".\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 1+, each time we have a \"(\", which indicates a new layer. Let me count the number of \"(\" after \"1+\": \n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...))): Here, the first \"1+\" is followed by \"(\", so that's layer 1.\n2. Then inside, another \"1+\", which is followed by \"(\", so that's layer 2.\n3. This continues until the innermost \"1+\" which is followed by \"3\", not a \"(\", so that's layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, without any further nesting. So that would be layer 1, then each layer adds a new 1+3*(previous). So maybe it's 8 layers? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to start evaluating from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. So let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\nThe innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). So that would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result). So that's 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, actually, perhaps it's easier to compute 29524*3. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n- The next digit is 9 (from 29524, which is 2 9 5 2 4). Wait, actually, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so 2*3=6, but we have a carry-over? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit places. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\nSo the result is 88572. So 3*29524=88572. Then 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute that.\n\n3*88573: Let's compute 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Wait, no, 88573 is 8*10000 + 8*1000 + 5*100 + 7*10 + 3. So:\n\n8*10000 = 80000\n8*1000 = 8000\n5*100 = 500\n7*10 = 70\n3*1 = 3\n\nSo 80000 + 8000 = 88000\n88000 + 500 = 88500\n88500 + 70 = 88570\n88570 + 3 = 88573\n\nNow, 3*88573: Let's compute it step by step.\n\n88573 \u00d7 3:\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21 \u2192 write 1, carry 2\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carry 1\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write 5, carry 2\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 2 = 26 \u2192 write 6, carry 2\nBut wait, 88573 has digits: 8,8,5,7,3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it digit by digit:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9 \u2192 units place\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21 \u2192 tens place: 1, carryover 2\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 hundreds place: 7, carryover 1\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 thousands place: 5, carryover 2\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24 + 2 = 26 \u2192 ten-thousands place: 6, carryover 2\nBut since there are no more digits, we add the carryover 2 as a new digit on the left.\n\nSo the result is 265719. Wait, let me check:\n\n88573 \u00d7 3:\n- 3\u00d73=9\n- 3\u00d77=21 \u2192 1, carryover 2\n- 3\u00d75=15 +2=17 \u21927, carryover1\n- 3\u00d78=24 +1=25 \u21925, carryover2\n- 3\u00d78=24 +2=26 \u21926, carryover2\n- Then, since there are no more digits, add the carryover 2 as the next digit.\n\nSo the result is 265719.\n\nWait, that seems correct because 88573 \u00d7 3 is indeed 265,719.\n\nSo, 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(265720). Let's compute that.\n\n3 \u00d7 265720: Let me compute this. 265,720 \u00d7 3.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n200,000 \u00d7 3 = 600,000\n60,000 \u00d7 3 = 180,000\n5,000 \u00d7 3 = 15,000\n700 \u00d7 3 = 2,100\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\nAdding up:\n\n600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000\n780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000\n795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100\n797,100 + 60 = 797,160\n\nSo 3 \u00d7 265,720 = 797,160.\n\nThen, 1 + 797,160 = 797,161.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(797,161).

Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, because each time we add another (1 + 3(...)). So I think there are 9 layers, meaning E_1 to E_9, with E_9 being the innermost. Wait, no, actually, when we start from the innermost, E_1 is (1 + 3), then E_2 is (1 + 3*E_1), and so on, up to E_9 being the outermost. But in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(E_9). Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nActually, the original expression is 3*(E_9), where E_9 is the innermost (1 + 3). Then E_8 is (1 + 3*E_9), E_7 is (1 + 3*E_8), etc., up to E_1 being the innermost. So we have 9 layers, from E_1 (innermost) to E_9 (outermost). But in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(E_9). Wait, that can't be because E_9 is the innermost. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outward. So let's define E_1 as the innermost (1 + 3), then E_2 as 1 + 3*E_1, E_3 as 1 + 3*E_2, and so on, up to E_9, which would be the outermost expression. But in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(E_9). So the total expression is 3*E_9, where E_9 is built from E_8, which is built from E_7, etc., down to E_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, if I can compute E_1, then E_2, up to E_9, and then multiply the final E_9 by 3, that should give me the answer. Let me write down each step.\n\nFirst, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, E_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E_9, so 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 29,524, which is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from E_1:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 another way to confirm.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n   29524\n*      3\n--------\n   88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. I counted 9 layers, but let me check again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3(, each 1+3( adds another layer. Let's count the number of 1+3(:\n\nStarting after the first 3(:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nAnd then the innermost is (1+3). So that's 9 layers of 1+3(...), meaning E_1 to E_9. So yes, 9 layers. So my calculation of E_1 to E_9 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By expanding each layer from the innermost outwards, we compute each step:\n\n1. E\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. E\u2082 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. E\u2083 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. E\u2084 = 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. E\u2085 = 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. E\u2086 = 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. E\u2087 = 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. E\u2088 = 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. E\u2089 = 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying E\u2089 by 3 gives 3\u00d729524 = 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, okay, so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar expression). Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3, then that's wrapped in another 3 times (1 + ...), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, it's another layer. So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time, it's 3 times (1 + ...), so let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of layers. From the innermost, I have 1 + 3, then that's inside another 3*(1 + ...), so that's two layers. Wait, no, actually, each time you go out, you add another layer. Let me try to write it out step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, since I see nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). Wait, let me check: starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then that's inside another 1 + 3(...), so each layer adds one more 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nL1: 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1)\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2)\n\nAnd so on, up to L9: 1 + 3*(L8)\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, actually, the innermost is L1: 1 + 3, then L2: 1 + 3*L1, L3: 1 + 3*L2, etc., up to L9: 1 + 3*L8, and then the entire expression is 3*L9. So, that would be 3*(L9). So, I need to compute L9, which is 1 + 3*L8, and so on, recursively. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from L1 up to L9, and then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nSo, starting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses is closed by the next one. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of 3*(...). So, L1 to L9, as I did earlier. So, I think my earlier calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n.\n\nGiven that L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^h = C*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify that. For n=1, L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as earlier.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap: by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, I was able to find a formula for L_n, which made the calculation much easier than computing each layer step by step, especially since n=9. Using the formula, I computed L9 and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. This seems solid, and both methods (step-by-step and using the formula) gave me the same answer, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute the value efficiently. \n\nEach layer \\( L_n \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\]\nwith the initial condition \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\nThe general solution for this recurrence relation is:\n\\[ L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\( n = 9 \\):\n\\[ L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3 gives:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each one is of the form 1 + 3(...). Let me count them again to be sure: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent one adds another layer. So, the innermost is the ninth one, and it's just (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Hmm, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Let's start by computing the innermost expression: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the second layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving outward another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the third layer simplifies to 40. Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, the fourth layer is 121. Next, moving outward, the fifth layer is 1 + 3*(121). Calculating that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, the fifth layer simplifies to 364. Now, the sixth layer is 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, the sixth layer is 1093. Moving outward, the seventh layer is 1 + 3*(1093). Let me calculate that: 3*1093 is 3279, and 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, the seventh layer simplifies to 3280. Next, the eighth layer is 1 + 3*(3280). Calculating that: 3*3280 is 9840, and 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, the eighth layer is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that: 3*9841 is 29523, and 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, the ninth layer simplifies to 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, the original problem is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524 is 88572. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, carry over 1; 2*3 is 6 + 1 is 7; 5*3 is 15, carry over 1; 9*3 is 27 + 1 is 28, carry over 2; 2*3 is 6 + 2 is 8. So, yes, 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, I computed each layer step by step, moving outward, and each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1. After computing all nine layers, I ended up with 29524, and then I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result of 88572. I think that makes sense. Each time, the numbers get significantly larger because each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which leads to exponential growth. Let me verify one of the steps to be certain. For example, the third layer: starting from 4, the second layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then the third layer is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. That seems correct. Similarly, the fourth layer is 1 + 3*40 = 121, which is correct because 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, so each step seems to be accurate. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost 3 by 29524:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let me count how many times this happens. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + another expression). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the left, the first one is 3(1 + ...), then inside that, another 3(1 + ...), and so on.

Wait, actually, maybe it's eight layers? Let me check. Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that with 1 + 3(...). Let me write it out step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let me assign each layer a number to keep track. Let's say layer 1 is the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So Layer 9 is 29524, so the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's do 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. So adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each layer again more carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's breaking down 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Let me add each part multiplied by 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500*3=1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20*3=60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that another way. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n9*3=27 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of times 3 is used in the expression. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each layer adds another 3(...). Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3(...\n9. ...3(1 + 3))\n\nSo there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers. So my calculation of 9 layers is correct, leading to the final result of 88572. I think that's right. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the result of the inner expression by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1 (innermost):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9 (outermost):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final result:**  \n    Multiply the outermost layer by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let me count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), and then each layer adds another 3 times a similar term. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of parentheses, so the innermost is the first one, and the outermost is the ninth. Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times something), and that something is another similar expression. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 1))\n3. Then: (1 + 3*(result from step 2))\n...\nAnd this continues until the outermost layer.\n\nI think there are nine layers here because each time we have a 3 multiplying a (1 + ...), and the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is nine. Let me confirm that. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So starting from the first one after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nI think there are nine layers in total because after the initial 3, there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, no, actually, the initial 3 is outside the first (1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is nine. Let me check: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that. So, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is (1 + 3*(layer 1)). Then layer 3 is (1 + 3*(layer 2)), and so on, up to layer 9. So, I need to compute from layer 1 up to layer 9, each time substituting the result into the next layer. That seems manageable. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, I can compute each layer starting from L1 and moving outward. Let's compute each one step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot it. L2 is 13.\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nMoving on to L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems right.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHold on, 3*364. Let me compute that again. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 is indeed 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 3279 + 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. So L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nHmm, 9840 + 1 is 9841. That seems right.\n\nNow, L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. So L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nOkay, so L9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9, so that's 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nWait, actually, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, let me write it out properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12: write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7: write 7, carry 0.\n\n5*3=15: write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8: write 8.\n\nSo the product is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Maybe I should recompute each layer just to be sure.\n\nStarting again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * (L0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L1 = 4, so perhaps L0 would be the term before L1. Let me think.\n\nActually, the standard form for a linear recurrence relation is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, with L1 = c. The solution is L_n = a^{n} * c + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nYes, for a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation of the first order, the solution is:\n\nL_n = a^{n} * L0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nwhere L0 is the initial term.\n\nIn our case, L1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. So perhaps L0 would be the term before that, which isn't defined here, but we can adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that our first term is L1 = 4, and each subsequent term is L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} for k >= 2.\n\nSo, for k from 2 to 9, L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}.\n\nWe can model this as a geometric series. Let's try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me write out the first few terms:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*4 = 1 + 3 + 36 = 40\n\nWait, that's not the standard approach. Alternatively, let's express each L_n in terms of L_{n-1}.\n\nWe have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using the method for solving such equations.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^{n}.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's take n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each n >= 1, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result without having to compute each layer step by step. That's pretty efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since in this problem, there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable, but it's good to know the general approach in case the number of layers increases.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form (1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, expanding the entire expression would result in a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLet me try expanding the expression to see if that's the case.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n(1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 =13\n\nThen, (1 + 3*(13))=1 +39=40\n\nThen, (1 +3*40)=121, etc.\n\nBut if I think about expanding all the parentheses, it would be similar to 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nIn fact, the expression can be represented as a sum:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3^k term.\n\nWait, let me think about it.\n\nIf I have the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), it's equivalent to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain number of terms.\n\nBut actually, in our case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... but not exactly, because each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a sum where each term is 3^k, starting from k=1 up to k=9.\n\nWait, let me try to see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. So,\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) up to nine layers.\n\nBut actually, each time we have a 3 multiplying a term that is 1 plus another similar expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me try to expand E step by step.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this step by step:\n\nStart from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) =4\n\nThen, moving one layer out:\n\n(1 + 3*4)=1 +12=13\n\nNext layer:\n\n(1 +3*13)=1 +39=40\n\nNext:\n\n(1 +3*40)=1 +120=121\n\nNext:\n\n(1 +3*121)=1 +363=364\n\nNext:\n\n(1 +3*364)=1 +1092=1093\n\nNext:\n\n(1 +3*1093)=1 +3279=3280\n\nNext:\n\n(1 +3*3280)=1 +9840=9841\n\nNext:\n\n(1 +3*9841)=1 +29523=29524\n\nFinally, E=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, as we can see, each layer adds another power of 3, but it's not a straightforward geometric series because each term is built upon the previous one.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the expression E, it's equal to 3*(1 + E'), where E' is a similar expression with one fewer layer.\n\nWait, but in our case, E has nine layers, so E' would have eight layers, and so on until the innermost layer, which is just (1 + 3).\n\nBut perhaps using the recurrence relation is more efficient.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is defined as \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Calculating each subsequent layer up to \\( L_9 \\) gives us the value needed for the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiplying \\( L_9 \\) by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. (1 + 3) equals 4. Now, moving one step out, the next part is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 equals 12. Then, we add 1 to that, so 1 + 12 equals 13. Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, maybe I should think of it as a recursive process where each layer depends on the previous one. Let me try to outline the steps more clearly. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer out: 3*(result from step 1) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\n3. Next layer: 3*(result from step 2) + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\n4. Next layer: 3*(result from step 3) + 1 = 3*40 + 1 = 121\n5. Next layer: 3*(result from step 4) + 1 = 3*121 + 1 = 364\n6. Next layer: 3*(result from step 5) + 1 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 3*(result from step 6) + 1 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 3*(result from step 7) + 1 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 3*(result from step 8) + 1 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9) + 1 = 3*29524 + 1 = 88573\n\nWait, hold on. I think I might have made a mistake here because when I started, the innermost was (1 + 3), which is 4, but each subsequent step was 3*(previous result) + 1. So, let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n3. Next: 3*13 + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40\n4. Next: 3*40 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\n5. Next: 3*121 + 1 = 363 + 1 = 364\n6. Next: 3*364 + 1 = 1092 + 1 = 1093\n7. Next: 3*1093 + 1 = 3279 + 1 = 3280\n8. Next: 3*3280 + 1 = 9840 + 1 = 9841\n9. Next: 3*9841 + 1 = 29523 + 1 = 29524\n10. Finally: 3*29524 + 1 = 88572 + 1 = 88573\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, after each step, I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It looks like each layer is tripling the previous result and then adding 1. So, if I have nine layers, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as layer 1, up to layer 9, which is the outermost one. Wait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3s: 3, then another 3, and so on. Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of (1+3...) terms. Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then each layer adds another (1+3(...))\nSo, starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me count how many times (1 + 3(...)) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each time we go out, we add another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each step adds another layer. So, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen, layer 2: 3*(layer 1) + 1 = 3*4 +1 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(layer 2) +1 = 3*13 +1 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 +1 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 3*121 +1 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 3*364 +1 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 3*1093 +1 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280 +1 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841 +1 = 29524.\n\nLayer 10: 3*29524 +1 = 88573.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a new layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent (1+3(...)) adds a layer. Let me count the number of (1+3) in the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of 3s. Each time, there's a 3 inside. Let me see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each 3 is followed by a (1+3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is followed by (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the number of (1+3) terms. Let me count the number of times (1+3) appears.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time you see (1+3(...)), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times (1+3) is nested. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So, when I computed up to layer 10, I think I went one step too far. Because the outermost layer is 3*(result from layer 9) +1. So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, meaning that after 9 steps, we get to the outermost expression.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent (1+3(...)) adds a layer. So, the number of layers is 9, meaning that after computing layer 9, we have the result inside the outermost 3(...).\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to layer 10, which would be the outermost 3(...). But perhaps that's correct because each layer adds another step. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 3*(f(n-1)) + 1, with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, for each layer, f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, starting from f(1)=4.\n\nThen, f(2) = 3*4 +1 =13\n\nf(3)=3*13 +1=40\n\nf(4)=3*40 +1=121\n\nf(5)=3*121 +1=364\n\nf(6)=3*364 +1=1093\n\nf(7)=3*1093 +1=3280\n\nf(8)=3*3280 +1=9841\n\nf(9)=3*9841 +1=29524\n\nf(10)=3*29524 +1=88573\n\nWait, so if the original expression has 9 layers, then f(9) would be 29524, and then the outermost 3*(f(9)) +1 would be 88573. But I'm not sure if the original expression has 9 layers or 8 layers. Let me count again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3) is a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3) terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have (1+3(...)), so the number of times (1+3) appears is equal to the number of layers.\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3) terms:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, the outermost expression is 3*(f(9)) +1, which would be 3*29524 +1=88573.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...)), so the outermost is 3*(inner expression). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, meaning that f(9) is the innermost, and then we have 3*f(9). Wait, no, in the recurrence, f(n) includes the 3*... +1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the expression as having n layers, where each layer is of the form 3*(previous layer) +1, starting from 4.\n\nSo, if the innermost is 4, then each layer out is 3*previous +1.\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers, then the value would be f(9)=3*f(8)+1, and so on, with f(1)=4.\n\nBut in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times (1+3) appears as a nested expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3) terms:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. Then (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(f(9)) +1, but wait, no. Because in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3*(inner expression), which would be 3*f(9). But according to my earlier computation, f(9)=29524, so 3*29524=88572. But in my earlier step-by-step, I included the +1 in each layer, so perhaps f(n) already includes the 1. Wait, no, in the recurrence, f(n)=3*f(n-1)+1, so f(1)=4, f(2)=13, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nIf the innermost is (1+3)=4, which is layer 1.\n\nThen, layer 2: 3*4 +1=13.\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 +1=40.\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 +1=121.\n\nLayer 5: 3*121 +1=364.\n\nLayer 6: 3*364 +1=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 3*1093 +1=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280 +1=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841 +1=29524.\n\nLayer 10: 3*29524 +1=88573.\n\nBut in the original expression, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of (1+3) expressions.\n\nEach time you see (1+3(...)), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, in the original expression, the number of (1+3) terms is 9, meaning that we have 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(f(9)) +1=3*29524 +1=88573.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to layer 10, which would be the outermost. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, and the outermost is layer 9, which is 29524, and then we multiply by 3 and add 1 to get 88573.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3*(inner expression). So, if the inner expression is f(9)=29524, then the result would be 3*29524=88572, but according to my earlier computation, f(10)=88573, which includes the +1. So, perhaps I'm confusing the layers.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the number of layers is 9, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, which is 3*(f(8)) +1. Wait, no, because f(n)=3*f(n-1)+1, so f(9)=3*f(8)+1, and f(8)=3*f(7)+1, etc., down to f(1)=4.\n\nTherefore, if the original expression has 9 layers, then f(9)=88573, which would be the result. Wait, but when I computed f(9), I got 29524, and f(10)=88573. So, perhaps the original expression has 9 layers, which would correspond to f(9)=88573.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let me write the expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) +1 = 13\n3. Next: 3*(13) +1 = 40\n4. Next: 3*(40) +1 = 121\n5. Next: 3*(121) +1 = 364\n6. Next: 3*(364) +1 = 1093\n7. Next: 3*(1093) +1 = 3280\n8. Next: 3*(3280) +1 = 9841\n9. Next: 3*(9841) +1 = 29524\n10. Next: 3*(29524) +1 = 88573\n\nSo, each step corresponds to a layer. The original expression has 9 layers, meaning that after 9 steps, we reach the outermost expression. Therefore, the result is 88573.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which has 9 layers, so the result would be 88573.\n\nBut let me confirm this with a smaller example to make sure my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have a simpler expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nLet's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*4 +1 =13\n\nNext layer: 3*13 +1=40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 +1=121\n\nWait, but according to my earlier method, with 3 layers, f(3)=40, and then the outermost is 3*40 +1=121.\n\nBut in this case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3))), which is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4)) = 3*(1 +3*(13)) = 3*(40)=120? Wait, no, because in my earlier computation, I included the +1 at each step, so f(3)=40, and then the outermost is 3*40 +1=121.\n\nWait, but in the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3))), the innermost is (1+3)=4, then 3*(4) +1=13, then 3*(13) +1=40, and then 3*(40) +1=121. So, the result is 121.\n\nBut according to the structure, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3))), which is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4)) =3*(1 +3*(13))=3*(40)=120. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier computation. So, perhaps my method is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm including an extra +1 in each step that's not supposed to be there. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3))), the innermost is (1 +3)=4.\n\nThen, moving outward, it's 3*(4) +1=13.\n\nThen, moving outward, it's 3*(13) +1=40.\n\nThen, moving outward, it's 3*(40) +1=121.\n\nBut when I compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3))), I should do it step by step without adding the +1 each time.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm treating each layer as f(n)=3*f(n-1)+1, but in reality, each layer is 3*(previous layer) +1, but the outermost layer is just 3*(previous layer). Wait, no, because in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which includes the +1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model it correctly. Let me try the smaller example again.\n\nExpression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3)))\n\nCompute innermost: (1+3)=4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4)=1 +12=13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13)=1 +39=40\n\nOutermost: 3*(40)=120.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier computation where I thought it was 121. So, perhaps my mistake was including an extra +1 in each step. So, in reality, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), except the outermost, which is 3*(previous layer).\n\nWait, no, in the original problem, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which includes the +1.\n\nSo, in the smaller example, the computation is:\n\nInnermost: (1 +3)=4\n\nNext layer: 1 +3*4=13\n\nNext layer:1 +3*13=40\n\nOutermost:3*40=120.\n\nSo, the result is 120, not 121. So, my earlier method was incorrect because I was adding 1 at the outermost layer, which isn't correct. The outermost layer is only 3*(previous layer), not 3*(previous layer) +1.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, how many layers are there, and how does this affect the computation?\n\nLet me try to clarify.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). Except for the innermost layer, which is just (1 +3).\n\nSo, the innermost layer is (1 +3)=4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, in the smaller example with 3 layers:\n\nLayer 1: (1 +3)=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nOutermost:3*40=120.\n\nSo, in this case, the number of layers is 3, but the computation stops at 3*(Layer 3)=120.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, if there are n layers, then the computation would be:\n\nLayer 1:4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\n...\n\nLayer k:1 +3*(Layer k-1)\n\n...\n\nOutermost:3*(Layer k)\n\nSo, in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of (1 +3) terms.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach (1+3) is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, let's count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5.

(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1:4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so in this case, the result is 88572, not 88573 as I thought earlier.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed up to f(10)=88573, I included an extra +1, which was incorrect because the outermost layer is only 3*(Layer 9), not 3*(Layer 9)+1.\n\nSo, in the smaller example, with 3 layers, the result was 120, which is 3*40, where 40 was Layer 3.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem with 9 layers, the result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so my earlier computation was incorrect because I included an extra +1 at the end. So, the correct result should be 88572.\n\nLet me verify this with the smaller example to ensure consistency.\n\nSmaller example with 3 layers:\n\nExpression:3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))\n\nCompute innermost: (1+3)=4\n\nNext layer:1 +3*4=13\n\nNext layer:1 +3*13=40\n\nOutermost:3*40=120.\n\nWhich matches 3*Layer3=3*40=120.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem with 9 layers:\n\nLayer9=29524\n\nOutermost=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed f(9)=29524, and then f(10)=88573, I was mistakenly including the +1 in the outermost layer, which isn't part of the expression. The outermost layer is only 3*(Layer9), not 3*(Layer9)+1.\n\nSo, the correct computation is:\n\nLayer1:4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought the answer was 88573, but now I'm getting 88572. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the number of (1+3) terms in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression:3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3) expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Therefore, Layer9=29524, and the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my earlier computation, I thought of f(n)=3*f(n-1)+1, starting from f(1)=4, which would give f(9)=29524, and then f(10)=88573. But in reality, the outermost expression is only 3*f(9), not 3*f(9)+1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let me compute the expression step by step, layer by layer, ensuring that I don't add an extra +1 at the end.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 +12=13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13)=1 +39=40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40)=1 +120=121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121)=1 +363=364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364)=1 +1092=1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093)=1 +3279=3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280)=1 +9840=9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841)=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I thought it was 88573, but now I see that was a mistake. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut to make sure, let me compute it again step by step.\n\nLayer1: (1+3)=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nOutermost:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous result, and the outermost layer is 3 times the ninth layer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. For each subsequent layer, compute 1 + 3*(previous result).\n3. After computing the ninth layer, multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there here? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Hmm, each time I see a 3 followed by a (1 + 3(...)). So, counting the number of times this happens: Let me see, the innermost part is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+3\" before each closing parenthesis. Wait, maybe a better approach is to work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward, simplifying each layer as I go. That seems manageable. Let me try that. So, starting from the very inside: The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me clarify: The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, that's 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(4). Let me write this down step by step. Let me number the layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9, maybe? Let's see: The innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1 result). So, layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(layer 9 result) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3: 29524*3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me write it out:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost layer: 3*29524=88,572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(...), so how many times does 3*(...) occur? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is layer 1: 1+3.\n\nThen, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3*(layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to layer9: 1+3*(layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, yes, 9 layers inside, and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, total layers from inside out: 9, and then the outermost is the 10th operation? Wait, no, the outermost is just multiplying by 3, so maybe the layers are 9, and then the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, the total number of layers is 9, and then the final multiplication by 3. So, yes, my earlier calculation is correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me confirm once more because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me try to write out each step again, perhaps using variables to represent each layer.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is computed as 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nLet\u2019s define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe a better approach is to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be represented as a geometric series, but the formula we derived seems to work perfectly.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result of the next layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let me count how many times 1+3 appears. Starting from the innermost part, which is 1+3, and moving outward, it looks like each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next layer. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one. Let me try to write this down step by step. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since each \"1+3\" is a new layer, and the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nAlright, let's compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. So Layer 1 is 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo Layer 2 is 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 3*13 = 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Let's compute that. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363.\n\nSo, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: Let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nSo, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's calculate this step by step.\n\nFirst, 9000*3=27000\n\nThen, 800*3=2400\n\nNext, 40*3=120\n\nFinally, 1*3=3\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29523\n\nThen, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have:\n\n3*(29524)\n\nCompute that: 3*29524\n\nLet me break this down:\n\n29524*3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplications.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each layer was computed step by step, and each time I multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me verify a couple of the layers to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nFor example, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*29524. Let's compute it again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all the layers check out, and the final multiplication by 3 also seems correct. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations upon reviewing, so I believe the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer's value builds upon the previous one. After calculating each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the final result by 3 to obtain the solution.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, so let's count how many times this nesting happens. I think each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and each layer is multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count them. Starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then each step adds another 3(1 + 3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9 because each time you go one step out, you add another layer. Wait, let me check that again. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" sections. Let's parse the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...)), where the ... is the first one.\n3. Then another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to work from the inside out. Let me start by evaluating the innermost expression first and then work my way outward. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that:\n\nFirst layer (innermost):\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. Let me write it down step by step.\n\nWait, no, perhaps each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me make sure I'm correct. Let me consider the structure.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then the next layer out would be 1 + 3*4, then the next layer would be 1 + 3*(result of previous layer), and so on.\n\nWait, but in the given problem, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me confirm how many layers there are. Each time we have a 1 + 3(...), so the number of layers is 9 because each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). So, let's count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" expressions. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another one. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final computation would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Each time I go one step out, I add a layer. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1, then each step out adds another layer up to layer 9. So, layer 9 would be the outermost one before the initial 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write this down more clearly:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 3*29,524.\n\nFirst, 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but that's not the right way to break it down. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 step by step.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should do it more carefully.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nWait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step. Because computing each layer manually might be error-prone, especially if there are more layers.\n\nWait, so each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3\u00d7L(n-1), where L(1) = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, L(1) is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen L(2) = 1 + 3\u00d7L(1) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL(3) = 1 + 3\u00d7L(2) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3\u00d7L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3\u00d7L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C\u00d73^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3\u00d7A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 0 = 1 + 2A \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = homogeneous + particular = C\u00d73^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C\u00d73^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3\u00d73^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19,683 -1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost expression is 3\u00d7L(9). So, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d7L(9) = 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've correctly identified the number of layers. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...)), where ... is the first one.\n3. Then another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Let me parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3 is a layer, and each layer is wrapped in another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nEach time you have a 1 + 3(...), so let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, n=9 layers.\n\nThus, using the formula, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked each layer step by step and also derived a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let's count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count: 1. Innermost: 1 + 3 2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3) 3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) ... and so on until the outermost layer. Wait, how many layers are there exactly? Let me see: The expression starts with 3(1 + 3(...)), and each time, the inner part is another 1 + 3(...). Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I think there are nine sets of parentheses. So, that would mean there are nine layers. Wait, let me check: Starting from the innermost, the first one is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, if I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), with nine sets of parentheses, that would mean there are nine layers to compute. So, maybe I can compute each layer starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as E_n, where n is the layer number. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3(E_1)\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3(E_2)\n\n...\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3(E_8)\n\nAnd then the entire expression is 3(E_9). So, the total expression is 3 times E_9, where E_9 is built up from E_8, which is built up from E_7, and so on down to E_1.\n\nSo, if I compute each E_n step by step, starting from E_1 and moving up to E_9, then I can find E_9 and multiply it by 3 to get the final result. That seems manageable.\n\nLet me write down each E_n step by step.\n\nFirst, E_1 = 1 + 3. That's simple.\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, moving on to E_2:\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3(E_1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12\n\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo, E_2 = 13\n\nNext, E_3:\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3(E_2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 3*13 = 39\n\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\nSo, E_3 = 40\n\nMoving on to E_4:\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3(E_3) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute 3*40: 3*40 = 120\n\nThen, 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE_4 = 121\n\nE_5:\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3(E_4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute 3*121: 3*120 = 360, plus 3*1 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363\n\nThen, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE_5 = 364\n\nE_6:\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3(E_5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute 3*364: Let's break this down. 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 = 1092\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE_6 = 1093\n\nE_7:\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3(E_6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's do this step by step. 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 = 3279\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE_7 = 3280\n\nE_8:\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3(E_7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240.

So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nE_9 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times E_9, so:\n\nTotal = 3 * E_9 = 3 * 29524\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, write down 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, write down 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8, write down 8\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, but since it's 29524, which is 30000 - 476, so 90000 - (476 * 3). Let's see: 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because this seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go through each E_n again to confirm:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each step checks out. So, I think the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about this is recognizing that each E_n is following a pattern. Maybe I can find a formula for E_n instead of computing each step manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula.\n\nLooking at E_n:\n\nE_1 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524\n\nIs there a pattern here? Let me see the ratio between consecutive terms.\n\n13 / 4 = 3.25\n\n40 / 13 \u2248 3.077\n\n121 / 40 \u2248 3.025\n\n364 / 121 \u2248 3.008\n\n1093 / 364 \u2248 3.000\n\n3280 / 1093 \u2248 3.000\n\n9841 / 3280 \u2248 3.000\n\n29524 / 9841 \u2248 3.000\n\nSo, starting from E_4, the ratio approaches 3. That's interesting. So, each term is approximately 3 times the previous term, but slightly less. So, perhaps this sequence is approaching a geometric progression with ratio 3, but with some initial terms not exactly following.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this recursively. Let's think about it.\n\nEach E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nSo, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nWith E_1 = 4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nFirst, homogeneous equation: E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0\n\nCharacteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3\n\nSo, homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = A\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolve for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\n-2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, E_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nSolve for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier terms to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: E_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: E_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: E_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: E_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: E_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: E_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: E_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 holds for each n. Therefore, I can compute E_n directly using this formula instead of computing each step, which would be more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nSo, in our problem, we needed E_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as we computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nThus, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Let's see:\n\nE_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1: (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2: (27 -1)/2=13, correct.\n\nYes, so the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each term is 1 + 3*previous term, which is a linear recurrence, and solving it as I did above gives a closed-form expression.\n\nSo, knowing that, for E_9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each nested expression as \\( E_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number. Starting from the innermost layer:\n\n\\[ E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\nWe then compute each subsequent layer using the recurrence relation \\( E_n = 1 + 3E_{n-1} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nE_2 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13, \\\\\nE_3 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40, \\\\\nE_4 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121, \\\\\nE_5 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364, \\\\\nE_6 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093, \\\\\nE_7 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280, \\\\\nE_8 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841, \\\\\nE_9 &= 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nWe recognize that each \\( E_n \\) follows the formula \\( E_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( E_9 \\):\n\n\\[ E_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying \\( E_9 \\) by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of nested expressions, I think there are nine layers here. Each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). Let me try to represent this in a more manageable way. Maybe I can define each layer as a variable. Let me denote each inner expression as a term a_n, where n is the number of layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, that would be a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, moving one layer out, a_2 = 1 + 3(a_1). Then a_3 = 1 + 3(a_2), and so on, up to a_9, which would be the entire expression inside the outermost 3. Wait, actually, the outermost is 3 times a_9, so maybe I should adjust that. Let me think again. If I start from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first innermost term. Then, moving outward, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me write down each step:\n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n\n1. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake, because that seems like a big number, and I might have messed up a multiplication somewhere.\n\nStarting again:\n\n1. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\n2. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. a_3 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\n4. a_4 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\n5. a_5 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\n6. a_6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. Correct.\n\n7. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Correct.\n\n8. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because each step seems to be growing exponentially, which makes sense because each layer is multiplied by 3. So, 3^9 is 19683, but here we have more than that because each step adds 1 before multiplying by 3. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be solved using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the a_n terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 13\n\na_3 = 40\n\na_4 = 121\n\na_5 = 364\n\na_6 = 1093\n\na_7 = 3280\n\na_8 = 9841\n\na_9 = 29524\n\nI notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have a_9, which is the ninth term, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using the formula. Since a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me go through the steps again without using the formula, just computing each a_n step by step:\n\na1=4\n\na2=1 +3*4=13\n\na3=1 +3*13=40\n\na4=1 +3*40=121\n\na5=1 +3*121=364\n\na6=1 +3*364=1093\n\na7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\na8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\na9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps, checked each computation, and even derived a formula to confirm the result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit time-consuming, but breaking it down layer by layer made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer a_n follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula for the ninth layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with 1 + 3(...). Each time, the inner expression is another 1 + 3(...), except for the innermost one, which is just 1 + 3. Let me try to count how many innermost expressions there are. Starting from the inside, the first one is 1 + 3. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, perhaps there are nine layers here. Let me check: The innermost is 1 + 3. Then each layer out adds another 1 + 3(...). So, if I number them from the inside out, the first layer is 1 + 3, the second is 1 + 3*(first layer), the third is 1 + 3*(second layer), and so on, up to the ninth layer, which is the entire expression. So, I can approach this by computing each layer starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost expression, and L9 is the entire expression. So, L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2. And so on, until L9. Once I compute L9, that should give me the value inside the entire expression, and then I need to multiply it by 3, as the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, perhaps the innermost expression is L1 = 1 + 3. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1. Then L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on, up to L9. But when I get to L9, that would be the expression inside the outermost 3*(...). So, the total expression is 3*L9. Hmm, maybe I should confirm that. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, the first term inside is 1, then 3 times another expression. So, the innermost expression is indeed 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I compute L1 to L9, then the entire expression is 3*L9. So, let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9, so 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\nThen, 24 * 3 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the multiplication again.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's multiply digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in computing L9. Let me go back through each step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364:\n\n3*300 = 900\n\n3*60 = 180\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nSo, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12 = 1092. So, L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093:\n\n3*1000 = 3000\n\n3*90 = 270\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nSo, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9 = 3279. So, L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280:\n\n3*3000 = 9000\n\n3*200 = 600\n\n3*80 = 240\n\nSo, 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240 = 9840. So, L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841:\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 +120 = 29520 +3 = 29523.\n\nSo, L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check that 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I can add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the number seems quite large. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Each time, I computed L1 through L9, so that should be correct. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) so each time, a new layer starts. So, starting from the innermost, I have 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(previous). So, yes, I think I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me think about that.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for L_n, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this for n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have L9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this makes sense. I approached it step by step, computing each layer, and then I verified using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). By iteratively computing each layer up to \\( L_9 \\) and then multiplying by 3, we find the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply \\( L_9 \\) by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let's count how many times the 1 + 3(...) part appears. Starting from the innermost part, which is just 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me see: 1. Innermost: 1 + 3 2. Next layer: 1 + 3(1 + 3) 3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) 4. And so on, until the outermost layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. Wait, actually, each time we have a new layer, so maybe it's 9 layers? Let me check: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost 3 times that: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me see. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3(...) sections. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each next layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does 1 + 3(...) occur? Let me parse the expression:\n\n- The innermost part is 1 + 3\n- Then, moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(innermost)\n- Then, 1 + 3*(previous)\n- And so on, until we have 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (innermost)\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...) and then the outermost 3 times that. So, 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nLet me check that again. Each time, we have a 1 + 3*(...), and each ... is the next layer. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on until the 9th layer, which would be 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, the entire expression is 3 times that 9th layer result.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses, starting from the first 3, how many times does 1 + 3 occur? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1 + 3(...) adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n2. Each time we have another (1 + 3(...)), so how many? Let's see:\n\nFrom the expression, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: each 3 is followed by another (1 + 3(...)). Wait, no, let me parse it correctly.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first (1 + 3(...) has 8 more opening parentheses inside. Wait, no, let me count the number of times 1 + 3 is inside.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to just compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. So, let me write down each step:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nSo, let's compute that: 3 * 29524\n\nFirst, let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048\n\n59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me recount the layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13 (Layer 2)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40 (Layer 3)\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121 (Layer 4)\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364 (Layer 5)\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 (Layer 6)\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 (Layer 7)\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 (Layer 8)\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nThen, 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have a 1 + 3(...), and each ... is the next layer. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many 1 + 3(...) are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then moving outward, each (1 + 3(...) is another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first (1 + 3(...) is one layer, then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on, until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen, each time we go outward, we add another layer.\n\nSo, the expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...) inside the first 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there's an opening parenthesis, then inside that, another 3, which has its own opening parenthesis, and so on, until we have 9 opening parentheses in total after the first 3.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me see: each time we have a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3(1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a tree. Each 3 branches into another 1 + 3(...), so the depth of the nesting is 9, meaning there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...) starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to Layer 9 being 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me just verify the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nYes, so I think that's the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here, but since the problem is only 9 layers deep, computing each layer step by step seems manageable.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result we got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\), and there are nine such layers before the entire expression is multiplied by 3. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one until we reach the ninth layer, which is 29,524.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let me count how many times the 1 + 3(...) part appears. Starting from the left, each time I see a 1 + 3 multiplied by another expression. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and so on. Let me try to compute this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. I think this is the right approach because each term depends on the result of the inner term. Let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that level gives me 13. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, now I have 40 at this level. Next level out, it's again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. Continuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. Next level: 1 + 3*1093. Calculating that: 3*1093 is 3279, and 1 + 3279 is 3280. Moving out another level: 1 + 3*3280. Let's see, 3*3280 is 9840, and 1 + 9840 is 9841. Next, the expression becomes 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841 is 29523, and 1 + 29523 is 29524. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3*29524. Let's calculate that: 3*29524 is 88572, and 1 + 88572 is 88573. Finally, the outermost expression is 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute that: 3*88573 is 265719, and 1 + 265719 is 265720. Now, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 265720. But remember, the original expression is 3 multiplied by that entire result. So, the final step is to compute 3*265720. Let me do that multiplication: 3*265720. Breaking it down, 265720 * 3. Let's compute 200,000*3 = 600,000, 60,000*3=180,000, 5,000*3=15,000, 700*3=2,100, 20*3=60. Adding all those together: 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000; 780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000; 795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100; 797,100 + 60 = 797,160. So, 3*265,720 is 797,160. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 797,160. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the large numbers. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4. Then, each subsequent step was 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, then 1 + 3*40=121, then 1 + 3*121=364, then 1 + 3*364=1093, then 1 + 3*1093=3280, then 1 + 3*3280=9841, then 1 + 3*9841=29524, then 1 + 3*29524=88573, then 1 + 3*88573=265720. Multiplying that by 3 gives 797,160. That seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 797,160.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result of the inner expression)}\\).

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let me count how many times this nesting happens. Starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 3 times something. Let me try to count the number of 3s or the layers. Wait, maybe I can write this as a series of steps, starting from the innermost expression and moving outward. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3 times that result. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since I can see nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check that again. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: the first one is after the 3, then each subsequent one. Let's see: starting from the innermost, 1+3, that's the first innermost, then each 1+3( next. Let me try to list them as Level 1 to Level 9.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So after computing Level 9, which is the innermost part, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). Let me check that again. So, the outermost part is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the ... is the rest of the nested expressions. So after computing up to Level 9, which is 29524, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nThen, 500 * 3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\n\nThen, 4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should add the digits step by step.\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, so 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I did the levels correctly because sometimes it's easy to miscount the levels. Let me recount the levels. The innermost is 1+3, which is Level 1. Then each layer adds another 3*(previous level). So:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's 9 levels. So the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any levels. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is the innermost, then each layer adds a 1+3(...). So the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3(...) appears. Let me count:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n... and so on until the outermost expression.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level. Let me count how many times the \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3: Let's see:\n\nStarting after the first 3, the first term is 1+3(...), then each subsequent term adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3( in the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new level. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n\n2. Then inside that, 3(1+3(...))\n\nContinuing, let me count each opening parenthesis:\n\nAfter the initial 3, the first parenthesis is the start of the first inner expression. Then each time we have a new \"1+3(\", that's a new level. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3:\n\nEach time we have \"1+3(\", that's a new level.\n\nSo:\n\nLevel 1: 1+3(...)\n\nLevel 2: 1+3(1+3(...))\n\nLevel 3: 1+3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n\nAnd so on. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\nFrom the string, after the initial 3, the number of \"1+3(\" is 8. Because the innermost part is 1+3), so before that, we have 8 \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time we have a \"(\", that's a new level. Let me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\nStarting after the 3, the first \"(\" is the start of Level 1. Then each subsequent \"(\" is a new level.\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the 3, the first \"(\" is Level 1, then each new \"(\" adds a new level.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n\n2. Then inside that, another \"(\", so Level 2.\n\nContinuing, let's see:\n\nEach time a new \"(\" appears after the initial 3, that's a new level. So, how many \"(\" are there after the initial 3?\n\nLooking at the string, it's 8 \"(\" after the initial 3, because the innermost is 1+3), so there are 8 \"(\" after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me count them:\n\nThe expression after the initial 3 is:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside this, how many \"(\" are there?\n\nStarting from the first \"(\", which is the first level, then each subsequent \"(\" adds a level.\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n\n2. (1+3(\n\n3. (1+3(\n\n4. (1+3(\n\n5. (1+3(\n\n6. (1+3(\n\n7. (1+3(\n\n8. (1+3(\n\n9. (1+3\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just write it out and count.\n\nThe expression after the initial 3 is:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" in this part:\n\n1. The first \"(\" after 3 is the start of Level 1.\n\n2. Then inside that, another \"(\", Level 2.\n\n3. Then another \"(\", Level 3.\n\n4. Then another \"(\", Level 4.\n\n5. Then another \"(\", Level 5.\n\n6. Then another \"(\", Level 6.\n\n7. Then another \"(\", Level 7.\n\n8. Then another \"(\", Level 8.\n\n9. Then another \"(\", Level 9.\n\nWait, but that would mean 9 levels, but the innermost part is 1+3, which is Level 9. So, perhaps I was correct initially that there are 9 levels, each corresponding to a \"1+3(\".\n\nSo, that would mean that the innermost is Level 9: 1+3=4.\n\nThen Level 8: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*40=121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121=364.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen the outermost expression is 3*Level1=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3, I think I get 8, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check again.\n\nThe expression after the initial 3 is:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first \"(\" is at the start, then each subsequent \"(\" is inside. Let me count the number of \"(\":\n\n1. The first \"(\" after 3 is Level 1.\n\n2. Then inside that, another \"(\", Level 2.\n\n3. Then another \"(\", Level 3.\n\n4. Then another \"(\", Level 4.\n\n5. Then another \"(\", Level 5.\n\n6. Then another \"(\", Level 6.\n\n7. Then another \"(\", Level 7.\n\n8. Then another \"(\", Level 8.\n\n9. Then another \"(\", Level 9.\n\nWait, but the innermost part is 1+3), so that would be 8 levels, right? Because after 8 \"(\", we reach the innermost 1+3. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe it's better to approach it as starting from the innermost and working outward, regardless of the number of levels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see.\n\nEach level seems to follow the formula: Level n = 1 + 3 * Level (n-1). So, if I can find a general formula for Level n, I can compute it without having to go through each step manually.\n\nLet me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this recursive relation.\n\nGiven that Level n = 1 + 3 * Level (n-1), with Level 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Level n = A * 3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition to find B.\n\nWhen n=1, Level 1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A * 3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, the recurrence relation is Level n = 1 + 3 * Level(n-1). Let me substitute the general solution into this equation to find A.\n\nLevel n = 1 + 3 * Level(n-1)\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B.\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition:\n\n4 = 3A + B = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Level n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nLevel n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the initial values.\n\nFor n=1: Level 1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: Level 2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, Level n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince the innermost level is Level 9, which is 29524, as we computed earlier, then the outermost expression is 3*Level9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, Level9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nSo, 3*Level9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of levels is indeed 9.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, let me count how many times the 3(1 + ... appears. Starting from the left, the first term is 3 times something. Inside that something is 1 plus 3 times another similar term. I can see that this pattern repeats multiple times. Let me count the number of nested expressions. Let's see: Each time I see a 3(1 + ..., and I can count how many of these there are. Let me try to count: Starting from the innermost part, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Then each layer wraps around that with 3 times (1 + 3(...)). So, let me count the number of layers. Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to count how many times the 3(1 + ...) occurs. Let me try to parse the expression. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + something). That something is 3 multiplied by (1 + another something), and this continues until the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. Let me count the number of times 3(1 + ... appears. Let's see:\n\n- The first term is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + ... until the innermost part. Let me count the number of layers. Let's see: The innermost part is 1 + 3, so that's the first layer. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost). Then the next is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on. Let me count how many layers there are. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 3*(1 + ...). Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2). And so on, until the outermost layer, which is layer n, where n is the number of layers. How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3(, there's an opening parenthesis, then another 3(, and so on. Let me count them:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of 3(1 + ... sections. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3(...\n9. ...3(1 + 3))\n\nSo, from this, I can see that there are 9 layers of 3(1 + ... starting from the innermost. Wait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see that there are 8 opening parentheses. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( is inside the previous one. Let's count the number of 3(1 + ... sections:\n\n1. The first 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...\n3. And so on, until the last one, which is 3(1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does 3(1 + ... occur? Let's see:\n\n- Starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 3(1 + ... until the innermost 3(1 + 3). So, the number of layers is 9? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 3( is followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count:\n\nAfter the first 3(, there's an opening parenthesis, then another 3(, then another opening parenthesis, etc. Let me see:\n\n- The entire expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8. Because each 3( is followed by an opening parenthesis, except the last one, which ends with a closing parenthesis. Wait, let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nFrom the first 3(, the structure is:\n\n3( [open] 1 + 3( [open] 1 + 3( [open] 1 + ... until the innermost 1 + 3).\n\nSo, each time we have a 3(, it's followed by an opening parenthesis, except the last one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n- 3( [open] 1 + 3( [open] 1 + 3( [open] 1 + 3( [open] 1 + 3( [open] 1 + 3( [open] 1 + 3( [open] 1 + 3( [open] 1 + 3 [close] ) [close] ) [close] ) [close] ) [close] ) [close] ) [close] ) [close] ) [close] )\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe a better way is to count the number of times we have 3(1 + ... starting from the first. Let's see:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + next layer). The innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on, up to layer 9, which is the outermost 3*(layer 8). Wait, but when I count the number of 3*(1 + ... sections, I think it's 9 layers because each 3*( starts a new layer. Let me try to count:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 (layer 1)\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1)\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2)\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(layer 3)\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(layer 4)\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(layer 5)\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(layer 6)\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer 7)\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer 8)\n\nWait, but in the given expression, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so that would be layer 9. So, there are 9 layers. Therefore, we have 9 layers to compute, starting from the innermost. So, let's start computing from the innermost layer and work our way outward. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The entire expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The given expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). So, each 3*(1 + ...) is a layer. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is L1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that, so L2 is 1 + 3*(L1), L3 is 1 + 3*(L2), etc., up to L9 being the outermost 3*(1 + L8). Wait, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), so that would be L9 = 3*(1 + L8). Then the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no. Wait, the outermost is 3*(1 + L8), which is L9. So, the entire expression is L9, but in the problem statement, it's 3*(1 + ...), so that's L9. Wait, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem is to compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). So, the entire expression is 3*(something), where something is 1 + 3*(another something). So, the outermost layer is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8). So, perhaps I made a mistake in the layer numbering.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8), and L8 is 1 + 3*(L7), etc., down to L1 = 1 + 3. So, let's adjust the layers accordingly.\n\nLet me redefine the layers:\n\n- L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n- L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nWait, so that would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check this because I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should count the number of 3*(1 + ...) terms. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is the 9th term. Then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the outermost layer is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8). So, L9 is 1 + 3*(L8), and the entire expression is 3*(L9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed L9 as 29524, which is 1 + 3*L8, where L8 was 9841. So, 3*L9 would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm this by computing each layer step by step, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me start again, computing each layer step by step:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me recompute each layer:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me see if I can find a general formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote the value of each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, we arrive at the same result.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer a_n follows a geometric progression, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but in this case, since it's a linear recurrence, the formula we derived is more straightforward.\n\nIn conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we can compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (L1):**\n   \\[\n   L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2 (L2):**\n   \\[\n   L2 = 1 + 3 \\times L1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3 (L3):**\n   \\[\n   L3 = 1 + 3 \\times L2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4 (L4):**\n   \\[\n   L4 = 1 + 3 \\times L3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5 (L5):**\n   \\[\n   L5 = 1 + 3 \\times L4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6 (L6):**\n   \\[\n   L6 = 1 + 3 \\times L5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7 (L7):**\n   \\[\n   L7 = 1 + 3 \\times L6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8 (L8):**\n   \\[\n   L8 = 1 + 3 \\times L7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (L9):**\n   \\[\n   L9 = 1 + 3 \\times L8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, the entire expression is:\n\\[\n3 \\times L9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count how many layers there are here. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a layer. Let me count them: 1. 3(1 + 3(...)) 2. 3(1 + 3(...)) 3. 3(1 + 3(...)) 4. 3(1 + 3(...)) 5. 3(1 + 3(...)) 6. 3(1 + 3(...)) 7. 3(1 + 3(...)) 8. 3(1 + 3(...)) 9. 3(1 + 3(...)) 10. 3(1 + 3(...)) Wait, actually, looking again, it seems like there are nine sets of parentheses inside each other. Let me check that: Starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)), and each time I go outward, I add another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So, I'll need to compute each layer starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me write each layer down and compute it step by step. Let's label them Layer 1 to Layer 9, with Layer 1 being the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nAnd then finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the original problem, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, perhaps I should compute each layer starting from the innermost. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121: Let me compute that. 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. So, 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: Let's compute that. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841: Hmm, let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3:\n\nCompute 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, actually, that might not be the most efficient way. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire result.\n\nLet me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the computations seem accurate. I don't see any errors in the individual steps, so I think the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
