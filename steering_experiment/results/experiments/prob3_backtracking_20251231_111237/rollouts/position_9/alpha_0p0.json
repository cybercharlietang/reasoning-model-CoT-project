    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, okay, so each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something. Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3, then 1 + 3 times that, and so on. Let me see, I think there are nine sets of parentheses here, so I might need to compute this nine times, working my way out each time. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. That's simple enough: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that 4. So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So the next layer out is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So now we're at 40. Moving another layer out, it's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So now we're at 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So now we're at 364. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*364 is... hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12, so adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 is 1093. Now we're at 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Now, moving another layer out: 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. Well, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. So adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So now we're at 9841. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Now, moving to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So now we're at 88573. Wait, but hold on, the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... we've just computed as 88573. So now, the final step is to compute 3*88573. Let me do that multiplication. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So the total is 265719. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 1+3*40=121, then 1+3*121=364, then 1+3*364=1093, then 1+3*1093=3280, then 1+3*3280=9841, then 1+3*9841=29524, then 1+3*29524=88573, and finally 3*88573=265719. Hmm, seems consistent. Each step seems to follow, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer starting from the innermost, we compute:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5.

Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3 * 88573 = 265719\n\n\\boxed{265719}"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, I count nine sets of parentheses here. So, starting from the innermost one, which is 1+3, then moving outward each time. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. I'll start by labeling each layer for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2)  \n... and so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nSo, I'll compute each layer one by one. Let me start with Layer 1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving to Layer 2, which is 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's result: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*10 is 30, 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 3). So, 1 + 3*40. Let's calculate 3*40: that's 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 4). That would be 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3. So, 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Next, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 5). So, 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 6). That is 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Let's break it down: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, adding those up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Moving on to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 7). So, that's 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. Breaking it down: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(result from Layer 8). So, that's 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, that's a bit bigger, but let's do it step by step. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by the result from Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 digit by digit. Let me do that: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carryover 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus the carryover 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carryover 2 is 8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again, because I might have messed up the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify with another method: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me recap each layer's computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me the result without computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad. However, if there were more layers, maybe a recursive formula or a geometric series approach could be useful. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, step-by-step computation is manageable.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the number of terms is small, computing each term as I did before is straightforward.\n\nBut just for knowledge, the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved as follows:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that. 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result we got for Layer 9. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Which is the same result as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can get the same answer without computing each layer, but it's reassuring that both methods give the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, yielding the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. (1 + 3) equals 4. Okay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, let me check: Each expression is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me write this out step by step. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. L1: 1 + 3 = 4. L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So L2 is 13. L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So L3 is 40. L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. L4 is 121. L5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So 363 + 1 is 364. So L5 is 364. L6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 364*3: Let's compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1092 + 1 is 1093. So L6 is 1093. L7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 1093*3. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 3279 + 1 is 3280. So L7 is 3280. L8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3280*3. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 9840 + 1 is 9841. So L8 is 9841. L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3. Let me compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 29523 + 1 is 29524. So L9 is 29524. Now, the outermost layer is 3*(L9) because the entire expression is 3*(...). So that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through each step again quickly. L1: 1+3=4, correct. L2: 1+3*4=13, correct. L3: 1+3*13=40, correct. L4: 1+3*40=121, correct. L5: 1+3*121=364, correct. L6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. L7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. L8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. L9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). Let's count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), and each layer wraps around with another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s multiplied. Each time, it's 3*(something). Let's see: Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 3*(1+3), then 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. Let me count how many layers there are. From the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, which is the 9th layer maybe? Wait, let me think. Let's see: The innermost is (1+3), which is the 1st layer. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3, each (1+3... is another layer. Let me count the number of 3s after each parenthesis. Wait, maybe it's easier to count the number of times 3 is multiplied by an expression. Let me see: The innermost is 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many 3s are there? Let me try to parse this step by step. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. So, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), right? Wait, no, let me make sure. Actually, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving out, it's 3*(1 + (previous result)). So, let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside and moving outward. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no. Let me think again. Because each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then, the next layer out would be 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Wait, but let me check if that's accurate. Let me write down each step clearly. Let's define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), each 3*(1 + ...) adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses, meaning 8 layers? Wait, no, let me count: Starting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each time, there's a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s. The first 3 is outside, then each time, inside, there's a 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1. Then, each time, moving out, we have another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s inside the expression. Let's see: Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 L1\n2. 3*(1 + L1) \u2192 L2\n3. 3*(1 + L2) \u2192 L3\n4. 3*(1 + L3) \u2192 L4\n5. 3*(1 + L4) \u2192 L5\n6. 3*(1 + L5) \u2192 L6\n7. 3*(1 + L6) \u2192 L7\n8. 3*(1 + L7) \u2192 L8\n9. 3*(1 + L8) \u2192 L9\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses, starting from the first 3, it's 3 followed by 8 opening parentheses, which would suggest 8 layers. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. Then, inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's the first layer.\n\nThen, inside that, it's 3*(1 + 3(...)), so that's the second layer.\n\nContinuing this way, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of 3s inside the expression, each followed by an opening parenthesis.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 8 more 3s, each followed by an opening parenthesis. So, that would be 9 layers in total, right? Because the first 3 is the outermost, and then each inner 3 adds a layer, so 1 + 8 = 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I started counting earlier, I had L1 to L9, which would be 9 layers. But when I was computing earlier, I got up to L9 as 36084. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the number of layers. Let me write the expression with each layer numbered:\n\nLayer 9: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \u2192 This is the entire expression.\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each layer wraps around with 3*(1 + ...), so Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer1).\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2).\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer9.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nSo, according to this, the entire expression simplifies to 36084. But let me verify this because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined by L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), where L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLet me write down the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084.\n\nI can see that each term is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 3, but wait, no, because each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L1 = 4.\n\nLet me expand the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nWait, I can see that each term is 3 more than a multiple of 3. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to write the recurrence as L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nWait, because 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence is L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 3.\n\nWait, actually, it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 3.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0 \u21d2 r = 3.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 3 \u21d2 -2A = 3 \u21d2 A = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 3/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 \u21d2 C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*(3^n) = (11/6)*(3^n) = (11*3^{n})/6.\n\nSimilarly, 3/2 is just 3/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (11*3^{n})/6 - 3/2.\n\nWe can factor out 1/6: L_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3: (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4: (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct.\n\nn=5: (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444. Correct.\n\nn=6: (11*729 - 9)/6 = (8019 - 9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1335. Correct.\n\nn=7: (11*2187 - 9)/6 = (24057 - 9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4008. Correct.\n\nn=8: (11*6561 - 9)/6 = (72171 - 9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12027. Correct.\n\nn=9: (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216513 - 9)/6 = 216504/6 = 36084. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for the first few terms, which is a good sign.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, 11*19683 = let's compute that.\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nSo, 196830 + 19683 = 216513.\n\nThen, 216513 - 9 = 216504.\n\nDivide by 6: 216504 \u00f7 6.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3.\n\n6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0.\n\n6 into 5 is 0 with remainder 5.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to note that 216504 \u00f7 6 = (216000 \u00f7 6) + (504 \u00f7 6) = 36000 + 84 = 36084.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my initial approach because sometimes when you have nested expressions, especially with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. In this problem, I think I correctly identified that there are 9 layers, from L1 to L9, each being 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the final result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this problem using the formula I derived, L_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. Since there are 9 layers, plugging n=9 gives L9 = 36084, which is the value of the entire expression.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not making any miscalculations in the exponent or the multiplication. Let me compute 3^9 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 11*19683: Let me compute 19683 * 10 = 196830, plus 19683 = 216513. Then, subtract 9 to get 216504, and divide by 6 to get 36084. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing it as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), which can be written as 3 + 3*previous layer.\n\nSo, L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, which I already solved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me see. Let me expand the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nAnd so on, up to 9 layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent each layer as a term in a geometric series.\n\nWait, from the formula, L_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 = 36084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n\nI think that's correct. I've cross-verified it using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, and both give the same result. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, and verifying with a derived formula, the final result is found to be 36084.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next nested term). The innermost term is (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n   - Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n   - Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n   - Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n   - Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n   - Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n   - Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n   - Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n   - Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n3. **Verification Using Formula**: The recurrence relation L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1} with L1 = 4 leads to the closed-form solution L_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. For n=9, this gives L9 = 36084.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{36084}"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, so there are nine sets of parentheses here. Let me count them: starting from the left, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is one layer, and I can see that it goes all the way to the ninth layer, which is just 1 + 3. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the result of the inner layers. To approach this, I think I should start by computing the innermost parentheses first and then work my way outward. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. So, L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 would be 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so L2 is 1 + 12 = 13. Next, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so L3 is 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer is getting bigger. Let me see if there's a pattern here or if I can find a formula instead of computing each layer manually because that might take a while. Alternatively, I can compute each layer step by step until I reach the outermost one. Let me try that. So, let's list each layer:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. That's correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. That seems right.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. So, L6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, L7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Thus, L8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Therefore, L9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3*(L9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the entire parentheses, which is L9. So, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Let me verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the steps.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. Adding those: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 = 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is L9. So, in my calculation, I computed L9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula for a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nWait, but actually, in my earlier steps, a1 was 4, a2 was 13, a3 was 40, etc. So, each term is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nHmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall how to solve such recurrence relations. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nIn this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, right? So, the homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of the form A*3^n. Then, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a1 is 4, which corresponds to n=1. Let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, in the problem, the innermost layer is L1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is a1. Then, L2 is a2, etc., up to L9, which is a9. So, when n=1, a1=4. Plugging into the general solution: a1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we saw earlier.\n\nSo, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have a9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3. So, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when I computed each layer step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I can compute this much more quickly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's pretty cool. It shows how recognizing a pattern and using recurrence relations can simplify the problem-solving process.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3 times that is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can write 3*a9 as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 59049*3 = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution. Each layer a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer, and I can see that there are nine such layers. Wait, actually, when I look at the expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). Let me count the number of 3s or the number of times 1 + 3 appears. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each layer wraps another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's see: from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then each layer wraps it with another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 is used. Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost), then the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on. So, if I start from the innermost, I can compute each layer step by step, working my way outward. Let me try that approach. Let's define each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on, up to L9, since I think there are 9 layers. Wait, let me check how many layers there are. Each time, we have a 1 + 3*(...), and the entire expression is 3*(L9). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer, so let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...\n...\nContinuing until the innermost 1 + 3. Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let's see:\n\n- The first layer after the initial 3 is 1 + 3(...), so that's 1.\n- Then, inside that, another 1 + 3(...), so that's 2.\n- Continuing until the innermost, which is 1 + 3, with no more parentheses. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s or the number of times 1 + 3 appears.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to notice that each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we can go from the outside in. Let me see: starting from the outermost 3, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), so the number of layers is 9 because the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Wait, actually, let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(layer 1), that's layer 2. Then layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on, until layer 9, which would be the outermost 1 + 3*(layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). Wait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I see that each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first ( is at position 1, then each subsequent ( is another layer. Let me count how many ( there are after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the first 3: 1 + 3(...\n2. Then, inside that: 1 + 3(...\n3. And so on until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, let's see: from the initial 3, we have 1 + 3(...), then inside that another 1 + 3(...), and so on. How many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each \"1 + 3(\" introduces another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is the start of the first layer.\n- Then, inside that, another (, so that's the second layer.\n- Continuing until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ... (1 + 3(...\n3. ... (1 + 3(...\n4. ... (1 + 3(...\n5. ... (1 + 3(...\n6. ... (1 + 3(...\n7. ... (1 + 3(...\n8. ... (1 + 3(...\n9. ... (1 + 3)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers? Because from the initial 3, the first ( is layer 1, and then each subsequent ( adds another layer, up to layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, I need to compute layer 1 to layer 9, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1 + 3. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1), and so on until layer 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on, up to layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nCompute L1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did each step correctly.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. So, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000+2523=29523. So, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572. So, total is 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check 3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7.\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8.\n- 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: digits are 2,9,5,2,4.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it as:\n\n  2 9 5 2 4\n*        3\n-----------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nL3=1 +3*13=40\n\nL4=1 +3*40=121\n\nL5=1 +3*121=364\n\nL6=1 +3*364=1093\n\nL7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nL8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nL9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*L9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A =1 => A= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I used the formula, I saw that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me see.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*L9, where L9=(3^{10}-1)/2. So, 3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula.\n\nBut since I already computed it step by step and verified it with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recount the layers:\n\nL1=4\n\nL2=1+3*4=13\n\nL3=1+3*13=40\n\nL4=1+3*40=121\n\nL5=1+3*121=364\n\nL6=1+3*364=1093\n\nL7=1+3*1093=3280\n\nL8=1+3*3280=9841\n\nL9=1+3*9841=29524\n\n3*L9=88572\n\nYes, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, that's nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me count them. Starting from the innermost, each time I add another layer. Let me count: 1. Innermost: 1 + 3. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me see, starting from the inside: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then the next layer is 1 + 3 times that result. Then the next layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result, and so on, until I reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3. So, maybe I can compute this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me try that. Let's label each layer for clarity. Let me denote the innermost expression as Level 1, then each subsequent layer as Level 2, Level 3, and so on, up to Level 9, and finally the outermost multiplication by 3 would be Level 10. Wait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a 1 + 3(...) term. So, starting from the innermost, Level 1: (1 + 3). Then Level 2: (1 + 3*(Level 1)). Level 3: (1 + 3*(Level 2)), and so on, up to Level 9: (1 + 3*(Level 8)). Then the outermost multiplication by 3 would be 3*(Level 9). So, in total, I need to compute from Level 1 to Level 9, then multiply by 3. Let me start computing each level one by one. Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's straightforward. Level 2: (1 + 3*(Level 1)) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Level 2 is 13. Level 3: (1 + 3*(Level 2)) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate 3*13: that's 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. So Level 3 is 40. Level 4: (1 + 3*(Level 3)) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Level 4 is 121. Level 5: (1 + 3*(Level 4)) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5 is 364. Level 6: (1 + 3*(Level 5)) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: (1 + 3*(Level 6)) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: (1 + 3*(Level 7)) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Level 9: (1 + 3*(Level 8)) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Wait, no, that's breaking it down into larger chunks, but maybe it's easier to compute 29524*3 directly. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nFirst, 4*3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another method to be sure. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = ?\n\nWell, 29524 \u00d7 3 can be computed as (29000 + 524) \u00d7 3 = 29000\u00d73 + 524\u00d73.\n\n29000 \u00d7 3 = 87000.\n\n524 \u00d7 3: 500\u00d73=1500, 20\u00d73=60, 4\u00d73=12. So 1500 + 60 = 1560, +12=1572.\n\nThen, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, the total expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps because it's easy to get lost in all those layers. Let me go through each level again quickly to check.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after double-checking each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized, so I don't have to compute each level manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at each level:\n\nLevel 1: 4 = 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 13 = 1 + 3\u00d74\n\nLevel 3: 40 = 1 + 3\u00d713\n\nLevel 4: 121 = 1 + 3\u00d740\n\nWait, I notice that each Level n is 1 + 3\u00d7Level (n-1). So, each term is following the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C\u00d73^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C\u00d73^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C\u00d73^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, Level 9 corresponds to n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form formula, we can confirm that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I might have just computed each level step by step as I did earlier, but recognizing the recurrence relation makes it much faster and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is correct. I went through each step carefully, double-checked my calculations, and even found a general formula to confirm the result. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the answer seems solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\), leading to a geometric progression. The final result is computed as:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times (1 + 3))))))))\n\\]\n\nAfter expanding each layer step by step, the result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of nested expressions, I think there are nine layers here, each starting with 3 times something. Let me confirm that. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by another (1 + 3(...)). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside and moving outward. Let me try that approach.\n\nAlright, so let's start by identifying the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. So, let me compute that first. (1 + 3) equals 4. So, that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have the next expression, which is 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost result)). Wait, no, actually, looking again, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3 times (1 plus the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, let's define each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen,\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, up to L9, which would be the outermost expression, and then the entire problem is 3*L9.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the original expression, it's 3*(...), so the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, perhaps L1 is the innermost (1 + 3), L2 is 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, perhaps each layer is 1 + 3*next layer, starting from the innermost. So, maybe I should compute each layer step by step, starting from L1 up to L9, and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many times does \"1 + 3*\" repeat? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count: starting from the first 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer out adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. Hmm, maybe it's better to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the expression.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, each time there's a (1 + 3( ... )). Let me count how many times this occurs. The first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each time you go out, you have another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me try to parse the expression step by step:\n\n1. The outermost is 3*(...). The inner part is (1 + 3*(...)).\n\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, there's a \"(\", so let's count them.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the initial 3 is followed by a \"(\", then each subsequent layer adds another \"(\", so let's count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the first 3, the first \"(\" starts the innermost layer.\n\n2. Then, each subsequent layer adds another \"(\", so let's count them:\n\n- 3(1+3(...)) => 1 \"(\"\n- Then another \"(\" inside, so total 2\n- Continuing, how many \"(\" are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each \"(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"(\":\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, so there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, that can't be right because the innermost is (1+3), which is just one \"(\" and one \")\", so perhaps the number of layers is 9? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, each starting with 3*(1 + ...). Let me try to approach this by starting from the innermost layer and working outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, let's start with the innermost expression: (1 + 3). That's layer 1.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nSo, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(L9). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the layers. Let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364:\n\n364 * 3: 4*3=12, 6*3=18 +1=19, 3*3=9 +1=10. So, 1092. So, L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093:\n\n1093 * 3: 3*3=9, 3*9=27, 3*0=0 +2=2 (carryover from 27), 3*1=3 +0=3. Wait, no, let me compute it properly.\n\n1093 * 3:\n\n3*3=9\n\n3*9=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n3*0=0 +2=2\n\n3*1=3.\n\nSo, 1093*3=3279. Therefore, L7=1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3280*3:\n\n3*0=0\n\n3*8=24, write down 4, carry over 2.\n\n3*2=6 +2=8\n\n3*3=9.\n\nSo, 3280*3=9840. Therefore, L8=1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 9841*3:\n\n3*1=3\n\n3*4=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*9=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a four-digit number: 9,8,4,1.\n\nWait, let me compute 9841 *3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carry 2. But since there are no more digits, we add the carryover: 29 becomes 290, but wait, that's not correct.\n\nWait, actually, when multiplying 9841 by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2. But since there are no more digits, we just add the carryover as 2, making it 29323? Wait, that can't be right because 9841*3 is 29523. Let me check:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\nCompute 9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Yes, so 9841*3=29523.\n\nTherefore, L9=1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me confirm with another method. 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3 can be broken down as:\n\n(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 +9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 +1500 +60 +12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. I assumed that L1 was the innermost (1+3), and each subsequent layer added another 3*(...). But perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's one layer. Then each time we go out, we have another (1 +3*(...)), so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, each subsequent term is (1 +3(...)), so let's count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. Therefore, there are 9 layers, meaning that L1 is the innermost (1+3), and L9 is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3. So, my calculation of 9 layers is correct, and the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, perhaps I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say I have 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))). How would that compute?\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nInnermost: (1 +3)=4\n\nNext layer: 3*(4)=12, then 1 +12=13\n\nNext layer: 3*(13)=39, then 1 +39=40\n\nOutermost: 3*(40)=120\n\nSo, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4)) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +12)) = 3*(1 +3*13) = 3*(1 +39) = 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I compute it using my layer approach:\n\nL1 =1+3=4\n\nL2=1+3*4=13\n\nL3=1+3*13=40\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L3=3*40=120. Which matches. So, my approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, with 9 layers, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the step-by-step approach seems solid. So, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, I count nine sets of parentheses here. Each one starts with 1 + 3 times something. So, perhaps if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, each step will be manageable. Let me try that. Let's denote each level of parentheses as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost one. So, starting with Level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Level 1 = 4. Now, moving out to Level 2, which is 1 + 3(Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Level 2 = 13. Next, Level 3 is 1 + 3(Level 2). Level 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives us 40. So, Level 3 = 40. Moving on to Level 4: 1 + 3(Level 3). Level 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1, we get 121. Level 4 = 121. Now, Level 5: 1 + 3(Level 4). Level 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Level 5 = 364. Level 6: 1 + 3(Level 5). Level 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1, we get 1093. Level 6 = 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3(Level 6). Level 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1, that's 3280. Level 7 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3(Level 7). Level 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1, we get 9841. Level 8 = 9841. Finally, Level 9: 1 + 3(Level 8). Level 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1, that's 29524. Level 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Level 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result should be 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check that multiplication because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me verify each step again quickly. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Level 1: 1+3=4. Level 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Level 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Level 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Level 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Level 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Level 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Level 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Level 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But wait, I just realized that each time I computed Level n, I used 3*(Level n-1) and added 1. So, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here, but since I was just computing each level step by step, maybe I should check if there's a better way or if I made any arithmetic errors. Let me verify the multiplication at each step. Level 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully stepping through each level and verifying each multiplication and addition, I'm confident that the result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula for a geometric series or something like that. The expression seems to have a recursive structure where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each Level n as L_n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9, which is the innermost expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + (b*(a^n - 1))/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. In our case, a = 3, b = 1, and L_1 = 4. Wait, but our recurrence starts at L_1, so perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me think: if I let L_1 = 1 + 3, then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, etc. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2, with L_1 = 4. So, to find L_n, we can write it as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n = 1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives the same result as computing each level step by step. This double-checking makes me even more confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of 3(...) terms, I see there are nine layers here. That means I'll need to compute each layer starting from the innermost one and moving outwards. Let me assign each layer a number to keep track. Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1, then the next one is Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Wait, no, that's not right. Because Layer 1 is actually the innermost, which is 1 + 3, but that's inside another expression. Let me correct that. Maybe I should think of it as each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n+1). Hmm, that might be a better way to approach it. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 8 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Starting from the innermost: Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*524=1572. Wait, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's compute step by step: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, so each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something, and that something is another similar expression. It looks like there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with 1 plus 3 times... Wait, actually, let me count them to be sure. Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me see, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a separate level. So, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3), and then each level adds another 1 + 3(...) around it. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the inside: 1. 1 + 3 2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) 3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) 4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) ... Wait, actually, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. Then, moving one level out, we have 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3(1 + 3) = 3 * 4 = 12. But wait, actually, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me clarify that. Each time, the structure is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)). So, after computing L9, which is the innermost expression, we have to remember that each layer is multiplied by 3 except the outermost one, which is multiplied by 3 as well. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, L1 is 1 + 3, then L2 is 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9, which is 1 + 3*L8. But then, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, looking back at the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is L9. So, actually, after computing L9, which is 29524, we have to multiply it by 3 to get the final result. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, L9 was 29524, which was the result of 1 + 3*L8. But then, the outermost expression is 3*(L9). So, let me correct that.\n\nWait, I think I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out: 3*(4) = 12, but wait, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nThen: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nThen: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nThen: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but that's only 8 layers. Let me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\n...\n\nEach time, we add another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\n4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\n5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\n6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\n7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\n8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\n9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me verify that. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from layer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again. It's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(4) = 12, but wait, no, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, all the steps seem correct. Each time, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, the pattern is each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the sequence goes 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify one more time. Sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I've got it right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nEach layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same as before.\n\nI could also try to find a closed-form formula for a_n, but since it's only 9 layers, it's probably faster to compute each step manually as I did.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After calculating each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer's value by 3. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next term})\\).\n\n2. **Start from the Innermost Parentheses:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Compute the Outermost Multiplication:**\n   - Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of opening parentheses, I think there are nine sets of parentheses. Let me check: Starting from the left, each 3 is followed by (1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s: 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3. Wait, that's nine 3s. So that means there are nine layers of parentheses here. Hmm, okay, so I need to compute each layer starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, (1 + 3) equals 4. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. But wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So maybe I should represent each layer as a term and compute them one by one.\n\nLet me try to define each layer as a variable to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nLet me denote:\n- Let\u2019s call the innermost expression as A\u2081 = 1 + 3\n- Then, the next layer out is A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081\n- Then, A\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082\n- And so on, until A\u2089, since there are nine layers.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and so on. So, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps it's better to represent each layer as A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from the innermost A\u2081 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, no, in the innermost, it's just (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, each time, we compute the innermost first, then use that result in the next layer, and so on until we reach the outermost layer. Then, the entire expression is 3 times the outermost result. Wait, let me confirm that.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, the first operation is 3 multiplied by the result of (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps the outermost layer is 3*(A), where A is the result of the inner expression, which itself is built from the layers. So, perhaps the way to approach it is to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, then moving outward, and then finally multiplying by 3.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this A\u2081 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: (1 + 3*A\u2081) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this A\u2082 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*A\u2082) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. A\u2083 = 40.\n\n4. Next: (1 + 3*A\u2083) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. A\u2084 = 121.\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*A\u2084) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. A\u2085 = 364.\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*A\u2085) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. A\u2086 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*A\u2086) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. A\u2087 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3*A\u2087) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. A\u2088 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*A\u2088) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. A\u2089 = 29524.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, after the innermost (1 + 3), each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), but in my calculation above, I'm adding 1 and then multiplying by 3 each time. But actually, looking back at the problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(next layer)). So, perhaps my approach is correct because each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, I computed A\u2081 through A\u2089, each time computing 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from A\u2081 = 4. So, if I have nine layers, then the outermost layer is A\u2089 = 29524. But then, the entire expression is 3*(A\u2089). Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which would be 3*A\u2089, where A\u2089 is the result of the innermost expression built up. But wait, in my calculation, A\u2089 is already 29524, so then the entire expression would be 3*29524. Wait, but that seems too big. Let me check my calculations again because maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of times I see a (1 + 3(...)).\n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nSo, each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3*(...)), and each of those continues until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see a (1 + 3(...)):\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then, inside that, another (1 + 3*(...))\n3. Continuing until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I thought before. So, each A\u2081 to A\u2089 would be the layers. So, A\u2081 = 4, A\u2082 = 13, A\u2083 = 40, A\u2084 = 121, A\u2085 = 364, A\u2086 = 1093, A\u2087 = 3280, A\u2088 = 9841, A\u2089 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089, which would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that because 3*29524 is indeed 88572. But let me verify each step because I might have made a calculation error somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089 = 3*29524. Let's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that again because sometimes when multiplying, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7       3\n----------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly because if I have nine layers, then A\u2089 is the outermost, but maybe the outermost is actually A\u2081\u2080? Wait, no, because each A\u2099 is the result of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as A\u2081.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the number of opening parentheses again in the original expression:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1 + 3(...) is a layer. So, starting from the first ( after 3, each time we have another (.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...))\n3. So, each time, I see a ( after 3(.\n\nSo, let's count:\n\nAfter the first 3(, there's a (1 + 3(...)), which is the first layer.\n\nThen inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), which is the second layer.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1 + 3). Let's count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nStarting from the first one after 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2.     (1+3(\n3.         (1+3(\n4.             (1+3(\n5.                 (1+3(\n6.                     (1+3(\n7.                         (1+3(\n8.                             (1+3(\n9.                                 (1+3)\n10.                            )\n11.                         )\n12.                      )\n13.                 )\n14.              )\n15.          )\n16.      )\n17.  )\n18. )\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(, so 9 layers, meaning A\u2081 to A\u2089. So, my initial calculation of 9 layers is correct, so A\u2089 = 29524, and then 3*A\u2089 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, with A\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for A\u2099.\n\nThe recurrence is A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, with A\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is A\u2099 = C*3\u207f + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nA\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081\n\nAssume A\u2099 = C*3\u207f + D\n\nThen, A\u2099\u208b\u2081 = C*3\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + D\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC*3\u207f + D = 1 + 3*(C*3\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + D)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*C*3\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + 3D = 1 + C*3\u207f + 3D\n\nSo, left side: C*3\u207f + D\n\nRight side: 1 + C*3\u207f + 3D\n\nSet them equal:\n\nC*3\u207f + D = 1 + C*3\u207f + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3\u207f from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1\n\nSo, D = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition A\u2081 = 4.\n\nA\u2081 = C*3\u00b9 + D = 3C + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, C = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2) * (1/3) = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is A\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nA\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nSo, A\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nA\u2081 = (3^(1+1) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2:\n\nA\u2082 = (3^(2+1) -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3:\n\nA\u2083 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nA\u2084=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, A\u2089 = (3^(9+1) -1)/2 = (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, A\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing the innermost part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))))))) Wait, hold on, I think I misapplied that. Let me correct myself. The innermost part is (1 + 3), so that's 4. Then, moving one level out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each time, I take the inner expression, compute it, and then plug it back into the outer expression. Let me try to structure this step by step. Let's denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Starting from Level 1: Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1 result) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Hmm, let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of Level 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Level 1: 1+3=4, correct. Level 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Level 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Level 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Level 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Level 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute this differently to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think my calculations are correct.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))) Hmm, okay, so there are nine sets of parentheses here, each time starting with 1 + 3(...). Each time, the inner expression is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Since they're nested, I think I should start evaluating from the innermost one and work my way out. Let me count how many innermost expressions there are. Starting from the right, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3*(...). So, there are nine layers in total. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside. Let me try that. Let's define each layer as follows: Let me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, ..., E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost. So, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1. E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9. Then the entire expression is 3*E9. That seems manageable. Let me start computing each E from E1 to E9 step by step. So, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Got that. Now, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to E3: E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, this is growing quickly. Let me keep going. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, E9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, but actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Let me check: 20000 + 9000 = 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from E1: 1+3=4, correct. E2: 1+3*4=13, correct. E3: 1+3*13=40, correct. E4: 1+3*40=121, correct. E5: 1+3*121=364, correct. E6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. E7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. E8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. E9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 3*29524 directly. Let me compute 29524*3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me do it step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus carryover 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we have 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Starting from the innermost part: the first innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3(1+...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of parentheses, so maybe there are nine layers here. Wait, let me check again. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time another layer is added by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So perhaps it's a recursive structure. Let me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define each level starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the result of Level 9. So after computing Level 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me go through each level again to check.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this problem. Maybe it's a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about that. Each level is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, for each level n, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall that the solution to a recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). In this case, c=3, d=1, and a_1=4. Wait, but let me check the indices. If a_1 = 4, then for n=1, a_1 = 4. For n=2, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. So, using the formula, the general term would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, our initial condition is a_1 = 4, so maybe I need to adjust the formula accordingly. Let me set n=1: a_1 = 4. Using the formula: a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Plugging in n=1: 4 = 3*a_0 + (3 - 1)/2 => 4 = 3a_0 + 1 => 3a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So the general formula would be a_n = 3^{n} * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me combine the terms: (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the same result I got earlier by computing each level step by step. That's reassuring. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. But wait, just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations with the exponents or the formula. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5=243, 3^10=(3^5)^2=243^2. Let me compute 243*243: 200*243=48,600; 40*243=9,720; 3*243=729. Adding them up: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320; 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. Correct. So 3^10=59,049. Then, (59,049 -1)=59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Then 29,524*3: 29,524*3. Let me compute that again: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by using the formula for the linear recurrence, and both methods gave me the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at each level follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the nth term of such a sequence, we compute the final value as 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me count how many nested layers there are. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a new layer. Let me count them: Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, that's layer 1: (1 + 3). Then layer 2: 1 + 3(layer1). Layer3: 1 + 3(layer2). Continuing this way, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Looking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) I can see that each \"1+\" is followed by \"3(...)\", so each \"1+\" is the start of a new layer. Let's count: Starting from the first \"1+\" after the first 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent \"1+\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a \"(\", so the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses. Let me count them: 1. (1+3(1+3(...))) 2. (1+3(...)) 3. (1+3(...)) 4. (1+3(...)) 5. (1+3(...)) 6. (1+3(...)) 7. (1+3(...)) 8. (1+3(...)) 9. (1+3(...)) 10. (1+3)) Wait, that seems too many. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1+\" terms. Each time I see \"1+\", that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent \"1+\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer1)\nLayer3: 1 + 3(Layer2)\n...\nHow many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"1+\" terms. Each \"1+\" is followed by \"3(\", so each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+\" in the expression. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+\" after the initial 3, each subsequent \"1+\" is another layer. Let's count:\n\n1. After the first 3: 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another \"1+\": 3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n3. And another: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n...\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3). Let me count the number of \"1+\" terms. Each \"1+\" is at a different level. Let me try to count them:\n\n- The first \"1+\" is at the top level: 3(1+3(...))\n- Then inside that, another \"1+\": 3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n- And so on, until the innermost.\n\nI think there are 9 layers of \"1+3(...)\" because each time I see a \"1+\", it's a new layer, and the expression has 9 \"1+\" terms after the initial 3. Wait, let me check again. Let me write out the layers step by step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nSo, the total number of layers is 9, starting from Layer1 at the innermost to Layer9 at the outermost. So, I'll need to compute Layer1 first, then Layer2, and so on up to Layer9, and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nLet me start by computing Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen Layer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake with such large numbers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then Layer8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So Layer9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3.\n\nBreaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4. So:\n\n20000*3=60,000\n\n9000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7.\n\n5 *3=15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7.\n\n9 *3=27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5 *3=15 +2=17. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the number is 29524, so the digits are:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nWait, actually, let me write it correctly:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\nStart from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 *3 =12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 *3=6 +1=7.\n\nNext digit:5 *3=15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit:9 *3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit:2 *3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. So yes, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+\" terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by \"3(...)\", so the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+\" terms after the initial 3.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+\" in the expression:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1+\" after the 3, each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. After the first 3: 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that: 3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nHow many \"1+\" terms are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression has 9 \"1+\" terms after the initial 3 because each time I see a \"1+\", it's a new layer. So, layers 1 through 9, as I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, my calculation of 88,572 should be correct.\n\nI think that's it. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Let me compute that first. \n\nStarting from the inside: \n\nFirst layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result plus 1. Let me write that down: \n\nSecond layer: 3*(4) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me check that. The second layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So actually, it's 3*(innermost result) + 1. So if the innermost is 4, then the next layer is 3*4 + 1, which is 12 + 1 = 13. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: \n\nThird layer: 3*(13) + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40\n\nWait, hold on again. Let me make sure I'm doing this right.

Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but hold on, let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many sets of parentheses? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3)\n\nThen each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied.

Let me count the number of \"3(\" in the expression:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(...\n10. 3(1+3))\n\nSo yes, there are 9 layers inside the first 3. Wait, no, actually, the first 3 is the outermost, and then each \"3(\" adds a layer. So starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), and moving outward, each \"3(\" adds a layer. So how many layers are there?

So the total number of layers is 9. Wait, but when I started computing earlier, I had 10 layers. Hmm, maybe I confused the count. Let me clarify.\n\nEach time we have a \"3(\", that's a new layer. So starting from the first 3, which is the outermost, then each inner 3 adds another layer. So the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\" in the expression. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo starting from the first 3, then each \"3(\" adds a layer. Let's see:\n\n1.

So the total number of layers is 10, including the outermost 3. Wait, no. The outermost is just 3 multiplied by a term, which is (1 + 3(...)). So the layers inside the first 3 are 9. So the innermost is layer 9, and then each layer is built outward.\n\nBut when I computed earlier, I started with layer 1 as (1 + 3) = 4, then layer 2 as 3*4 + 1 = 13, and so on up to layer 9. Then the final result is 3*(result of layer 9). So maybe I was correct earlier with 9 layers inside, and then the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(something). The something is (1 + 3*(another something)), and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3). So the number of layers is equal to the number of times you have 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s inside the expression:\n\nStarting from the first 3 after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nSo there are 9 instances of 3*(...). Therefore, the innermost is layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen layer 8: 3*4 + 1 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 3*13 + 1 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*40 + 1 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 3*121 + 1 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 3*364 + 1 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n\nThen the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 9 layers inside, but when I count from the innermost, it's 9 layers, and then the outermost is another layer. So total layers are 10. But in the expression, the outermost is just 3*(...), so maybe it's 9 layers inside. Let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute starting from the innermost and working outward. Let me try that again step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers in total. But in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"3(\" adds a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...\n- Then inside that, another 3(...\n- And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo let's count the number of \"3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3(...\n\nSo there are 9 instances of \"3(\", meaning there are 9 layers inside the first 3. Therefore, when I computed up to layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that would be correct because the outermost layer is 3*(layer 9). So that seems consistent.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try computing it step by step again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but earlier when I counted the layers, I thought there were 9 layers inside, but when I computed, I ended up with 9 layers and then multiplied by 3. So that makes sense because the outermost is just 3*(result of the inner 9 layers). So the total computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, so each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something, and that something is another similar expression. Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I think I need to compute from the innermost one and work my way out. Let me count the number of 3s. Starting from the innermost, which is the last 1+3, that's one. Then each layer adds another 3. So, actually, there are nine layers here. Wait, no, let me count again. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then 1+3( that result), and so on, until there are nine layers. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one. Let me try that approach. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times L9, so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as follows: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, 2; carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, 7. 5*3=15, 5; carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, 8; carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify each step because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. L7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. L8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. L9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, finally, 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the way. Alternatively, I can do 29524 *3 as (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3=87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So 1500+72=1572. Then 87000 + 1572=88572. So that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this problem as a geometric series or something similar, but given that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, it might be a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula I can use. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are nine layers, so L9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the recurrence relation, which gives the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, the final result is calculated as follows:\n\n1.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))). Hmm, I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each containing 1 plus 3 times another expression. So, starting from the innermost one, which is 1 + 3, and then moving outward. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. Let's count: starting from the innermost, that's the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another. Wait, actually, the innermost is the last one, so maybe I should start from there. Let me try to parse this step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses: the last one is 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.

L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times L9, so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. Wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, 29,524 *3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total value is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or count incorrectly. The original expression has nine layers because each time you open a parenthesis, you have to close it, so from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. Let me recount the layers step by step to confirm. Starting from the innermost: 1 +3, that's the first layer. Then, moving outward, each time it's 1 +3*(previous layer). So, layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88,572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might help verify my result. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. Similarly, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Starting from the innermost part, the first expression is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent expression adds another layer of 3 times the next one. So, let's start by computing the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Let me denote each layer as Layer 1, Layer 2, up to Layer 9, where Layer 1 is the innermost and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, Layer 1: (1 + 3) Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) Layer 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)) ... and so on until Layer 9. Wait, maybe it's better to compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost parentheses, which is Layer 1: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)). But wait, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)), but actually, looking back at the original expression, each layer after Layer 1 is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, perhaps I should index them from the inside out as Layer 1, Layer 2, etc., each being 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, if I start from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then, moving outward, Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)). Then Layer 3 would be 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)), and so on. So, each Layer n is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer (n-1))). Let me confirm that. So, starting from Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, that seems high, but let's go on. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Hmm, that's growing quickly. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 3*(354)) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 3*(3189)) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 3*(28,704)) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 3*(258,339)) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 3*(2,325,054)) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 3*(20,925,489)) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404. Wait, that seems like a huge number. Did I do that correctly? Let me check my calculations step by step because these numbers are getting really big, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's start over and compute each layer carefully. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*Layer1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Correct. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1,062) = 3*1,063 = 3,189. Correct. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3,189) = 3*(1 + 9,567) = 3*9,568 = 28,704. Correct. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339. Correct. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054. Correct. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489. Correct. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404. Hmm, so according to this, the final result is 188,329,404. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each time we add a layer. So, if Layer 1 is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be the first 3*(1 + ...). So, yes, I think I computed up to Layer 9 correctly. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a recursive formula or maybe even a closed-form solution. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}) = 3 + 9*a_{n-1}. So, a_n = 9*a_{n-1} + 3. That's a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 9*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 9 = 0, so r = 9. The homogeneous solution is A*9^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 9*C + 3 => C - 9C = 3 => -8C = 3 => C = -3/8. So, the general solution is a_n = A*9^n + (-3/8). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*9^1 + (-3/8) => 4 = 9A - 3/8. Let's solve for A: 9A = 4 + 3/8 = 32/8 + 3/8 = 35/8. So, A = (35/8)/9 = 35/(72). Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (35/72)*9 - 3/8 = (35/72)*9 = 35/8, and 35/8 - 3/8 = 32/8 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 +12)=39. Using the formula: a_2 = (35/72)*81 - 3/8. 81 is 9^2, so (35/72)*81 = (35*81)/72 = (35*9)/8 = 315/8. 315/8 - 3/8 = 312/8 = 39. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8. Let me compute that. First, compute 9^9. 9^1=9, 9^2=81, 9^3=729, 9^4=6561, 9^5=59049, 9^6=531441, 9^7=4782969, 9^8=43046721, 9^9=387420489. So, 9^9=387,420,489. Now, (35/72)*387,420,489. Let me compute that step by step. First, compute 35 * 387,420,489. That's a big number. Let me see: 35 * 387,420,489. 35 is 30 + 5. So, 30*387,420,489 = 11,622,614,670. 5*387,420,489 = 1,937,102,445. Adding them together: 11,622,614,670 + 1,937,102,445 = 13,559,717,115. Now, divide that by 72: 13,559,717,115 \u00f7 72. Let me compute that. 72 goes into 13559717115 how many times? Alternatively, maybe I can factor numerator and denominator to simplify. Let's see: 13,559,717,115 \u00f7 72. Let me see if 72 divides into 13,559,717,115. 72 = 8 * 9. Let's check if 13,559,717,115 is divisible by 8. The last three digits are 115. 115 \u00f7 8 = 14.375, so no, it's not divisible by 8. Wait, that can't be right because 35 and 72 have a common factor. Wait, 35 and 72 are co-prime, so maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute (35/72)*387,420,489 as (35 * 387,420,489) / 72. Let me compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 first, then multiply by 35. 387,420,489 \u00f7 72. Let's compute that. 72 * 5,380,000 = 72*5,000,000=360,000,000; 72*380,000=27,360,000. So, 5,380,000 *72=360,000,000 +27,360,000=387,360,000. That's close to 387,420,489. So, 387,420,489 - 387,360,000=60,489. Now, 72*839=60,489 because 72*800=57,600, and 72*39=2,808; 57,600+2,808=60,408. Wait, that's 60,408, which is 81 less than 60,489. So, 72*839=60,408. So, 60,489=72*839 + 81. Wait, but 81 is 72*1.125, which isn't an integer, so perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 as follows: 72 * 5,380,000=387,360,000 as before. Then, 387,420,489 - 387,360,000=60,489. Now, 60,489 \u00f772. Let's see: 72*800=57,600. 60,489 -57,600=2,889. 72*40=2,880. So, 72*40=2,880. 2,889 -2,880=9. So, total is 800 + 40=840, with a remainder of 9. So, 60,489 \u00f772=840 with a remainder of 9, which is 840 + 9/72=840 + 1/8=840.125. Therefore, 387,420,489 \u00f772=5,380,000 +840.125=5,380,840.125. Now, multiply this by35: 5,380,840.125 *35. Let me compute that. 5,380,840 *35: 5,380,840 *30=161,425,200; 5,380,840 *5=26,904,200. Adding them together: 161,425,200 +26,904,200=188,329,400. Now, the 0.125 *35=4.375. So, total is 188,329,400 +4.375=188,329,404.375. But since we're dealing with integer values in the original problem, the fractional part must have canceled out, so the result is 188,329,404. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 188,329,404. But just to make sure, let me check with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds. Let's say n=1: 3*(1+3)=3*4=12. Wait, but according to the initial step-by-step, Layer1=4, which is (1+3). Then Layer2=3*(1 +3*4)=39, which is 3*(13). But in the problem, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so for n=1, the expression would be 3*(1+3)=12, which is correct. If n=2, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*13=39, which matches Layer2. So, the formula a_n=3*(1 +3*a_{n-1}) with a1=4 gives the correct results for n=1 and n=2, so it's likely correct up to n=9. Therefore, the answer is 188,329,404. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the innermost expression into the next outer layer.

That means I'll need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost one. Let me number these layers for clarity. I'll consider the innermost part as Layer 1, and each subsequent layer as we move outward will be Layer 2, Layer 3, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is multiplied by 3, so that's Layer 10, maybe? Hmm, not sure if numbering helps, but let me try.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's simple enough. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: The next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: Now, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: Next, 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524. Let's compute this again. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern that can be generalized. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the recursive formula seems to hold, and each step is consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that my answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since each term is a linear recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCalculating 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} -3 = 177147 -3 = 177144.\n\nThen, (177144)/2 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, using both the recursive step-by-step method and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both methods, checked each step, and even derived a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute the value step by step. Using a recursive approach and verifying with a closed-form formula, we find the final result to be:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Okay, so each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Hmm, I think there are nine layers here because each time the expression starts with 3(1+3(...)). Let me check: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then that's multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next layer, and so on, until we have nine such layers. Wait, actually, let me count the number of times the pattern repeats. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step goes up one more layer. Let me try to write each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, since there are nine layers of nesting. So, Layer 1 is the innermost part: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost part, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, actually, wait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe the outermost layer is Layer 9, but let me check again. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me see: the innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, it's another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, there are nine instances of 1+3 before we reach the outermost multiplication by 3. So, perhaps there are nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, to compute this, I can compute each layer starting from the innermost one and work my way out. Let me try that.\n\nLet me define each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572, so 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, is the answer 88572? Wait, let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524 *3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. I had nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). But let me check the original expression again to ensure that I have nine layers.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) parts inside each other. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then that's inside another 1+3(...), and so on, until we have nine such layers. So, when I computed Layer 1 through Layer 9, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is the outermost part before the final multiplication by 3. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nWhich is exactly what I computed earlier. So, the sequence is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nAssume a_n = C*3^{n} + D.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSubstituting the assumed form:\n\nC*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D\n\n= 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nSo, left-hand side: C*3^{n} + D\n\nSet equal to right-hand side: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the 9th layer, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step, layer by layer, or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me verify one more time with the step-by-step computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the numbers. Let me see the sequence of a_n:\n\na1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524.\n\nLooking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, which aligns with the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, starting from a1=4, each subsequent term is 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each a_n is equal to (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form formula corroborates the step-by-step computation.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, if I count the number of opening parentheses, it looks like there are nine sets of parentheses. That means I'll need to compute this nine times, starting from the innermost one. Let me try to label each level to keep track. Let's say the innermost expression is Level 1, then the next one is Level 2, and so on up to Level 9. \n\nStarting with Level 1: $1 + 3$  \nThat's simple enough. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Level 1 equals 4.\n\nNow, moving to Level 2: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 1}$  \nWe just found that Level 1 is 4, so substituting that in: $1 + 3 \\times 4$  \nFirst, I should compute the multiplication before the addition. 3 times 4 is 12. Then, add 1: 12 + 1 = 13. So, Level 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Level 3: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 2}$  \nLevel 2 is 13, so substituting: $1 + 3 \\times 13$  \nAgain, multiplication first: 3 times 13 is 39. Then, add 1: 39 + 1 = 40. Level 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Level 4: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 3}$  \nLevel 3 is 40, so: $1 + 3 \\times 40$  \nMultiplication: 3 times 40 is 120. Addition: 120 + 1 = 121. Level 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 4}$  \nLevel 4 is 121, so: $1 + 3 \\times 121$  \n3 times 121 is 363. Adding 1: 363 + 1 = 364. Level 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 5}$  \nLevel 5 is 364, so: $1 + 3 \\times 364$  \nFirst, 3 times 364. Let me compute that. 3 times 300 is 900, and 3 times 64 is 192. So, 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. Level 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 6}$  \nLevel 6 is 1093, so: $1 + 3 \\times 1093$  \nCompute 3 times 1093. Let's break it down: 3 times 1000 is 3000, 3 times 90 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. Level 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 7}$  \nLevel 7 is 3280, so: $1 + 3 \\times 3280$  \nCompute 3 times 3280. Let's do this step by step: 3 times 3000 is 9000, 3 times 200 is 600, and 3 times 80 is 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. Level 8 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: $1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 8}$  \nLevel 8 is 9841, so: $1 + 3 \\times 9841$  \nCompute 3 times 9841. Let's break this down: 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 800 is 2400, 3 times 40 is 120, and 3 times 1 is 3. Now, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. Level 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, remember that the entire expression is 3 times Level 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 times 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. \n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3 times 29524: \n\nFirst, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n3 times 20000 = 60000  \n3 times 9000 = 27000  \n3 times 500 = 1500  \n3 times 20 = 60  \n3 times 4 = 12  \n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 + 12 = 88572  \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you break down numbers, it's easy to make an error. Let me compute 3 times 29524 directly.\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.  \n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.  \n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.  \n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7.  \n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.  \n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8.  \n\nSo, writing it out: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88,572. Yep, that matches what I had before. So, I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nJust to recap, I worked from the innermost parentheses outwards, computing each level step by step, and then multiplied the final result by 3 to get the answer. Each step involved multiplying by 3 and then adding 1, which seems to follow a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since it's nested, it required sequential computation.\n\nI think that's it. I can't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level of the expression follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous level result)}\\). By systematically solving each level step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the innermost result by 3 at each stage, leading to the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Level 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Level 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Level 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Level 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Level 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Level 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Level 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Level 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Level 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Each one adds another layer of 3 multiplied by another (1 + ...). So, to tackle this, I should start from the innermost part and work my way out. That means I'll start with the innermost 1+3 and then build each layer step by step. Let me try that. \n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from the inside, each time I compute a layer, I can substitute it into the next outer layer. \n\nLet me try to write this down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. \n\nLet's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. \n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). Hmm, maybe I need to think of each layer as being 3*(1 + previous layer). Wait, let me clarify. Let me parse the expression correctly. \n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to consider each layer as 1 + 3*(next layer), then multiplied by 3. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to work from the inside out, calculating each nested expression step by step. Let me try that. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, but actually, looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 13. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, but each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe I need to multiply each result by 3 as well. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the layers. Let me try to parse this more carefully. \n\nLet me write the expression with labels for each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a term. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 3s outside:\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is another layer. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 3s before each (1+...):\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\n1+3, then 1+3*(...), then another 1+3*(...), and so on. Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nEach time, after the first 3, we have a (1+3(...)), and this repeats. So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, which is the first layer.\n\nThen, each time we go out, we add another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach time there's a ( after a 3, except the first one. Let's see:\n\n- The first ( is after the first 3: 3(1+3(...))\n- Then another ( after the next 3: 3(1+3(1+3(...)))\n- And so on.\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) segments.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of times 3 is followed by (1+3. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time after that, there's a 3 followed by (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times this occurs.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), then another 3 followed by (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) segments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, if I have 9 layers, then Layer 1 is 1+3=4, Layer 2 is 1+3*4=13, Layer 3 is 1+3*13=40, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is 1+3*Layer8=29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, writing down each result.\n\nLet me start:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the layers. Let me double-check each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. If I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nTo solve this recurrence, let's see if we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the value of the nth layer is indeed (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me see: 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each layer step by step, and also derived a general formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the value of Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and each time we add another layer of 3 times that plus 1. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. \n\nWait, actually, each time we have a 3 multiplying a (1 + something). Let me try to parse it step by step. Let me denote each layer as a separate expression. Let's define each level from the innermost to the outermost. \n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: \n\nLet me number them as Layer 1 to Layer 9, since each time we have a new layer. Wait, actually, looking at the expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by another expression), and this repeats 8 times. Wait, let me check: \n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3. Each time, we have a 3 multiplied by another expression. Let me count the number of 3s inside: starting from the first 3, then each layer adds another 3. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Then Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. Wait, but in the given expression, how many layers are there? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then each time, wrapping another 1 + 3*(...). So, the first innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Continuing until Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total number of layers is 9, each adding another 3*(previous layer). Therefore, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. \n\nLet me start computing each layer one by one. \n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. \n\n3 * 29524: \n\nLet me compute 3 * 29524 step by step. \n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, actually, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nBut maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check each layer's calculation to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with larger numbers.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. \n\nHmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could get tedious with more layers. Let me think if there's a mathematical approach to generalize this.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, which in this case, a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but in our case, the first term is L_1 = 4. Let me adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nWait, actually, the standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is:\n\nL_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(a - 1), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write it as L_n = a^{n}*(L_0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Let me check.\n\nGiven L_0, L_1 = a*L_0 + b.\n\nL_2 = a*L_1 + b = a*(a*L_0 + b) + b = a^2*L_0 + a*b + b.\n\nSimilarly, L_n = a^n*L_0 + b*(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2} + ... + a^0) = a^n*L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nIn our case, L_1 = 4, and the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 for n >= 2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the layers go from 1 to 9, so n=9. But our initial condition is L_1 = 4, so perhaps we need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of the expression as starting from L_0 = 1, and then each layer adds a multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. Wait, no, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so that would be L_1 = 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9.\n\nSo, in terms of the recurrence, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nUsing the formula for linear recurrences: L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but in our case, the initial condition is L_1 = 4, so perhaps we need to adjust the formula.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc.\n\nThe general solution for L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1 is L_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a particular solution.\n\nTo find D, set L_n = D, then D = 3*D + 1 \u2192 D - 3D = 1 \u2192 -2D = 1 \u2192 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms our earlier result.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is defined as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2} = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 3} = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 4} = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 5} = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 6} = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 7} = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8} = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times \\text{Layer 9} = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, that's nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count. Starting from the innermost part, each time I have a 1 + 3(...), and each of those is multiplied by 3 on the outside. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that approach. Let's denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost: Let me call the innermost expression E1, then the next one E2, and so on up to E9, which would be the outermost expression. So, E1 = 1 + 3. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1. E3 = 1 + 3*E2. And so on, until E9 = 1 + 3*E8, and finally, the entire expression is 3*E9. So, if I compute E1 through E9 step by step, I can find the value. Let me start with E1. E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Next, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so E3 is 40. Moving on to E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E4 is 121. Now, E5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 121, so E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E5 is 364. Next, E6 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E6 is 1093. Then, E7 = 1 + 3*E6. E6 is 1093, so E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E7 is 3280. Now, E8 = 1 + 3*E7. E7 is 3280, so E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E8 is 9841. Finally, E9 = 1 + 3*E8. E8 is 9841, so E9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. E9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2. 2*3=6, plus the carried 1 is 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors in calculation. Starting from the innermost E1=4, then E2=13, E3=40, E4=121, E5=364, E6=1093, E7=3280, E8=9841, E9=29524. Then, multiplying E9 by 3 gives 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could try expanding the expression step by step without using variables, just to confirm. Let me attempt that as a check. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Then: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each term step by step until reaching the outermost expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n1. E\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. E\u2082 = 1 + 3*E\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. E\u2083 = 1 + 3*E\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. E\u2084 = 1 + 3*E\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. E\u2085 = 1 + 3*E\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. E\u2086 = 1 + 3*E\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. E\u2087 = 1 + 3*E\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. E\u2088 = 1 + 3*E\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. E\u2089 = 1 + 3*E\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*E\u2089:\n3*29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Starting from the left, I see that each time there's a 3 multiplied by another (1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s multiplied by the parentheses. \n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3). Then,\n2. The next one is 3*(1 + 3),\n3. Then 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)),\n4. And this pattern continues until there are nine layers, I think. Let me check: starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, if I have nine sets of parentheses, each one nesting inside the previous, then I need to compute from the innermost outwards. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let's try that. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me clarify. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4. Then Layer 8 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 9). Let me make sure I'm numbering the layers correctly. \n\nWait, maybe I should number them starting from the innermost as Layer 1 and moving outward. So, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. \n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), so after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me check that. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So if Layer 9 is 29524, then the total would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. \n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- 9*3 = 27, write down 27.\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, so 2, carryover 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, so 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, so 5, carryover 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8, carryover 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, so 8.\n- 9*3 = 27, so 7, carryover 2, but since there are no more digits, we write 27 as 27.\n\nWait, that gives us 88572, but let me confirm:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12= 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the number of layers. The original expression has how many 3s? Let me count the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier:\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"3(\" corresponds to a layer.

Wait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers because there are 9 sets of \"3(\".\n\nWait, but when I numbered the layers from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost, that's correct. So Layer 1 is the innermost (1+3), and Layer 9 is the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So Layer 9 is the innermost expression, and each layer wraps around it. Wait, perhaps I got the numbering wrong. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the expression as starting with the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer wraps around it with 3*(1 + ...). So the innermost is (1+3)=4. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4)=15. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15)=3*(16)=48. Wait, but that doesn't match my earlier calculation. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me parse the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. Let me write down each step:\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n2. 3*(1 + result from step 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nNext layer out:\n\n3. 3*(1 + result from step 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nNext layer:\n\n4. 3*(1 + result from step 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nNext layer:\n\n5. 3*(1 + result from step 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nNext layer:\n\n6. 3*(1 + result from step 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nNext layer:\n\n7. 3*(1 + result from step 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nNext layer:\n\n8. 3*(1 + result from step 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nNext layer:\n\n9. 3*(1 + result from step 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), so after step 9, which gives 36084, we have to multiply by 3 again? Wait, no, because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). So perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So the number of layers is 9, each adding another 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, after computing the 9th layer, which would be 3*(1 + ...), that result is the entire expression, which we then multiply by 3? Wait, no, because the outermost is 3*(...). Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from how many layers there are. Let me count the number of times \"3(\" appears. Each \"3(\" starts a new layer. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The first 3( is the outermost, then inside it is 1 + 3(...), which is another layer, and so on. So how many \"3(\" are there? Let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo there are 9 \"3(\" in the expression, which means there are 9 layers, each with 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3)=4, then each layer wraps around it with 3*(1 + previous result). So after 9 layers, the result would be the innermost expression multiplied through all 9 layers, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3? Wait, no, because the outermost expression is 3*(...), so the result after 9 layers is inside that outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting with the innermost, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So let's try again, step by step.\n\n1. Start with (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo after 9 layers, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 36084. Then, the entire expression is 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier result of 88572. Hmm, so which one is correct? Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were 9 layers, but perhaps the outermost 3*(...) is the 10th layer? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\":\n\n- 3(\n- 3(\n- 3(\n- 3(\n- 3(\n- 3(\n- 3(\n- 3(\n- 3(\n\nSo, 9 \"3(\" in total. That means that after computing 9 layers, the result is 36084, and then we have to multiply by 3 again because the entire expression is 3*(...). Wait, no, because the outermost is 3*(...), so the 9 layers are inside that. Therefore, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So Layer 9 is 36084, so total is 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nBut earlier, when I numbered the layers from 1 to 9 starting from the innermost, I thought that Layer 9 was 29524, leading to 3*29524 = 88572. But now, by recounting, I'm getting 108252. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the layers. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, ensuring that each step is correct.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nWait, that seems consistent now. So the correct answer should be 108252.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought the layers were 9 and then multiplied by 3, I got 88572, which must have been incorrect. So perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me see: in the original expression, how many layers are there? Each \"3(\" introduces a new layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\":\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the left, the first \"3(\" is at the very beginning, then each subsequent \"3(\" inside the parentheses. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, there are 9 \"3(\" in the expression, which means 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, after computing 9 layers, we get 36084, and then the entire expression is 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought that the innermost was Layer 1, and each subsequent layer added another 3*(1 + ...). So, with 9 layers, the result is 36084, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 108252. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by computing each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(36084) = 108252.\n\nYes, that seems correct now. So my initial mistake was perhaps miscounting the number of layers or miscalculating one of the steps. Let me check the multiplication steps again to ensure there are no errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*36084 = 108252 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the steps check out now. So the correct answer should be 108252.\n\nWait a second, but earlier I thought the answer was 88572, which was based on a miscalculation. So, to be thorough, let me compute each layer again, just to make sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nThen, 3*36084 = 108252\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 108252.\n\nI think I initially miscounted the layers, thinking that after 9 layers, the result was 29524, but that was incorrect. By carefully stepping through each layer and ensuring each multiplication is accurate, I arrived at 108252, which seems to be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the result of the next layer). Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed step by step:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4  \n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15  \n3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48  \n4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 147  \n5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 444  \n6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335  \n7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008  \n8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027  \n9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084  \n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost result by 3:  \n3 * 36084 = 108252  \n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{108252}"

Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count: \n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until I reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me see. Each time I have a 1 + 3(...), and the innermost is just (1 + 3). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. Wait, let me check: \n\n- The first parenthesis after 3 is (1 + 3(...))\n- Then another (1 + 3(...))\n- Continuing until the last one, which is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, actually, there are 9 layers because each 3(...) adds another layer, starting from the innermost. So, let's number them from the inside out as layers 1 to 9.\n\nStarting with layer 1: (1 + 3). That's simple, 1 + 3 is 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(result from layer 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(result from layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(result from layer 3). 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nWait a second, 121? That seems a bit high, but okay, let's keep going.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(result from layer 4). So, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(result from layer 5). 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(result from layer 6). 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute that: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then plus 1 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(result from layer 7). 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Plus 1 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(result from layer 8). 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Well, 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result from layer 9. So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 29524*3: \n\n- 29524 * 3:\n  - 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n  - 2*3=6 +1=7.\n  - 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n  - 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n  - 2*3=6 +2=8.\n  - So, writing it down: 88572. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572. Let me just go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYeah, that seems correct. Each step checks out, so I think I've got the right answer here. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable. I was a bit worried when the numbers got large, but breaking down each multiplication helped prevent mistakes. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 3 multiplied by a (1 + something), so maybe each layer adds another 3. Let me try to count the number of nested expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1. (1 + 3) 2. (1 + 3(...)) 3. Another one... Wait, maybe it's better to count how many times the pattern repeats. Let me see: Each time, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times another expression). So starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me try to compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside. So, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 = 12. Then, the next layer is (1 + 12). Let me write this down step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3 * 4 = 12\n3. Next: (1 + 12) = 13\n4. Next layer: 3 * 13 = 39\n5. Next: (1 + 39) = 40\n6. Next layer: 3 * 40 = 120\n7. Next: (1 + 120) = 121\n8. Next layer: 3 * 121 = 363\n9. Next: (1 + 363) = 364\n10. Next layer: 3 * 364 = 1092\n11. Next: (1 + 1092) = 1093\n12. Next layer: 3 * 1093 = 3279\n13. Next: (1 + 3279) = 3280\n14. Next layer: 3 * 3280 = 9840\n15. Next: (1 + 9840) = 9841\n16. Finally, the outermost layer: 3 * 9841 = ?\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has how many sets of (1 + 3(...))? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me see: the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). Each \"...\" represents another layer. Let me count how many times the pattern repeats. Let's see: Starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each step out adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9, because each layer adds one more 3*(...). Wait, no, let me check again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each layer adds another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer out is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9 because each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and the innermost is the 9th layer. Wait, maybe I should count the number of times the pattern repeats. Let me try to write it as a sequence:\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(L9). So, the total would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers because the original expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer, then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the number of layers is 9. So, L1 to L9.\n\nWait, but when I did the calculation earlier, I had L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, L4 = 121, L5 = 364, L6 = 1093, L7 = 3280, L8 = 9841, L9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this because sometimes when I'm counting layers, I might have missed one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and L_1 = 4.\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\nL_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check this because earlier when I did the step-by-step computation, I got L9 = 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm if the number of layers is indeed 9. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). So yes, n=9.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that the initial step-by-step computation matches this.\n\nEarlier, I computed:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 13\n\nL3 = 40\n\nL4 = 121\n\nL5 = 364\n\nL6 = 1093\n\nL7 = 3280\n\nL8 = 9841\n\nL9 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, the final answer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, let's count how many nested expressions there are. Each time I see a 1+3(...), that's another layer. Let me count them: starting from the innermost, there's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see: the innermost is the last 1+3, and each step out adds another 3 multiplied by the next expression. So, maybe there are nine layers here? Let me check: starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, let's number them from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. \n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time it's 1+3(...). So, let's count the number of 1+3 terms. Each time, it's 1+3 times the next expression. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), Layer3:1+3*(Layer2), and so on until Layer9, which is the outermost one, and then multiplied by 3. So, the total number of layers is 9, right? Let me confirm: the innermost is Layer1:1+3, Layer2:1+3*(Layer1), Layer3:1+3*(Layer2), and so on up to Layer9, which is the expression inside the outermost 3(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, if I compute each Layer from 1 to 9, I can substitute each into the next, working my way out. That sounds manageable. Let me start with Layer1.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple. So, Layer1 is 4.\n\nNow, Layer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer3 is 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer4 is 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer5 is 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer6 is 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer7 is 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer8 is 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 * 3. Let me break it down: 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400, plus 120 is 29,520, plus 3 is 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 is 29,524. So, Layer9 is 29,524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000*3 is 60,000, 9,000*3 is 27,000, 500*3 is 1,500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Now, add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but let me see if that's the case. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nYes, that's the same as before.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, so maybe a_0 would be something else? Let me think.\n\nWait, if I let n=1, then a_1 = 4. So, using the formula, a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nPlugging in n=1: 4 = 3*a_0 + (3 - 1)/2 => 4 = 3a_0 + 1. So, 3a_0 = 3, so a_0 = 1.\n\nSo, the general formula would be a_n = 3^{n} * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me combine the terms: (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, indeed, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 gives the correct value for each layer. Therefore, Layer9, which is a_9, is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if I consider the entire expression as 3*(a_9), which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59,049 -1)/2 = 3*(59,048)/2 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach also leads to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost part:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), and then each layer adds another 3(1+...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Starting from the innermost, I think there are nine layers here because I can see nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, each layer adds another 3(...), so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n... and so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of 3(...) terms. Let me see: Each time, the expression is 3 times (1 + something). So from the inside out, each step is:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3)\nStep 2: 3*(1 + result from Step 1)\nStep 3: 3*(1 + result from Step 2)\n... and so on, until we reach the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, how many steps do we have here? Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. Wait, the expression is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) nine times. Let me check: starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested inside. So, the number of layers is 9. Therefore, I need to compute this expression by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, computing each layer step by step. That seems manageable.\n\nLet me try to structure this. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Then, I can compute each layer based on the previous one.\n\nLet me define each layer:\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\nL2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4)\nL3: 3*(1 + L2)\nL4: 3*(1 + L3)\n...\nUp to L9: 3*(1 + L8)\n\nWait, but actually, in the given expression, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from L1 as (1+3), then L2 is 3*(1 + L1), L3 is 3*(1 + L2), and so on until L9.\n\nBut wait, in the given expression, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), so perhaps I need to adjust my counting. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, the innermost is (1+3)=4, then the next layer is 3*(1+4)=3*5=15, then the next layer is 3*(1+15)=3*16=48, and so on until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, so maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me write this out step by step.\n\nLet me start numbering the layers from the inside out, so layer 1 is (1+3), layer 2 is 3*(1 + layer1), layer3 is 3*(1 + layer2), etc., up to layer9, which is the outermost.\n\nSo:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so according to this, the final result is 36084. Hmm, that seems quite large, but let's check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the final answer would be 36084. But just to make sure, let me try computing it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + a(a + a(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nLooking at each layer, each Layer n is 3*(1 + Layer n-1). So, Layer n = 3*(1 + Layer n-1). Let's denote Layer n as L_n.\n\nSo, L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1})\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nHmm, I notice that each term is 3 times (1 plus the previous term). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1})\n\nWith L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence in a standard form:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 3\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 3\n\n-2A = 3 => A = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1.5\n\nAdding 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3C\n\nSo, C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 = (11*3^{n}) / 6\n\nSo, L_n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 - 3/2\n\nWe can factor out 1/6:\n\nL_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n(11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nYes, because 3/2 = 9/6, so:\n\n(11*3^n)/6 - 9/6 = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nSo, L_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nL4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\nL5 = (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\nL6 = (11*729 - 9)/6 = (8019 - 9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1335 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\nL7 = (11*2187 - 9)/6 = (24057 - 9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4008 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\nL8 = (11*6561 - 9)/6 = (72171 - 9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12027 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\nL9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216513 - 9)/6 = 216504/6 = 36084 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all the layers up to n=9. So, the final result is indeed 36084.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is structured as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times, it's essentially a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 each time. But in this case, since the nesting is deep, the step-by-step approach or the recurrence relation seems more straightforward.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the expression using another method, perhaps expanding it step by step without using the formula, just to cross-verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nNext layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36084.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation formula give the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer helped a lot.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 3 times (1 plus the result of the previous layer). After systematically computing each layer step by step, the final result is found to be 36084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, counting the number of 1+3 terms, it looks like there are nine layers of nesting. So, maybe I should start by solving the innermost part and then work my way out. Let's start by identifying the innermost parentheses. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, 3 times 4 is 12. Then, the next layer is 1 plus that 12. So, 1 + 12 is 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 3 times 13, which is 39. Then, the next layer is 1 + 39, which equals 40. Next, 3 times 40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Continuing outward, 3 times 121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Next, 3 times 364 is 1,092. Then, 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. Moving out another layer, 3 times 1,093 is 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 is 3,280. Next, 3 times 3,280 is 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 is 9,841. Moving out one more layer, 3 times 9,841 is 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 is 29,524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 times 29,524, which is 88,572. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Sometimes when I do a lot of steps, it's easy to miscalculate. Let me go through each step again to verify. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving out, 3 * 4 = 12. Next, 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 3 * 13 = 39. Next, 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 3 * 40 = 120. Next, 1 + 120 = 121. Then, 3 * 121 = 363. Next, 1 + 363 = 364. Then, 3 * 364 = 1,092. Next, 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Then, 3 * 1,093 = 3,279. Next, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Then, 3 * 3,280 = 9,840. Next, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Then, 3 * 9,841 = 29,523. Next, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Finally, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, and I didn't notice any errors in the calculations. So, I think the final result is 88,572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem from a different angle. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can help verify the answer. Let me think about what kind of pattern this expression represents. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if I denote each nested expression as a term, maybe I can represent it recursively. Let's define a sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Let me try that. Let me denote a\u2081 as the innermost expression. So, a\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081. Similarly, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082, and so on, up to a\u2089, which would be the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3. So, in this case, since there are nine layers, we have a\u2081 through a\u2089, with each a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081. Let me compute each a\u2099 step by step to see if I get the same result. Starting with a\u2081: a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. a\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. a\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. a\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. a\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. a\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. a\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, using this recursive approach, I still get 88,572. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for the nth term of this sequence. Let me explore that. Since each term a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a\u2099 = c + r*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, the solution is a\u2099 = A*r\u207f + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. So, the general solution would be a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B. To find A and B, we can use the initial condition and the recurrence. First, when n = 1, a\u2081 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3\u00b9 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, using the recurrence relation, a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081. Let's plug n = 2 into the general solution: a\u2082 = A*3\u00b2 + B = 9A + B. But from the recurrence, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 1) 3A + B = 4, 2) 9A + B = 13. Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Then, plugging A back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the general solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2. Simplifying that, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a\u2081 = (3\u00b2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a\u2082 = (3\u00b3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a\u2083 = (3\u2074 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3\u00b9\u2070 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Wow, that's another way to get the same result, which further confirms that the answer is correct. I think I'm pretty confident now that 88,572 is the right answer. Just to recap, I approached the problem in three different ways: 1. Working from the innermost parentheses outward step by step. 2. Using a recursive sequence approach, computing each term based on the previous one. 3. Finding a closed-form formula using the theory of linear recurrence relations. All three methods led me to the same result, so I feel very certain that 88,572 is the correct value of the given expression. It's interesting how different mathematical techniques can converge on the same solution, reinforcing the answer's validity. I guess this problem was a good exercise in nested expressions and recursive thinking. It also showed how powerful it is to recognize patterns and apply different problem-solving strategies to confirm a result. I might have been stuck if I only tried one method, but by exploring multiple approaches, I was able to solidify my understanding and confidence in the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can work from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))) So, I can count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(...)\", that's a layer. Let me count them. Starting from the left, the first layer is 1 + 3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me see: 1. The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Because that's the last part before the closing parentheses start. So, maybe I should start there. Let me write that down: Innermost layer: 1 + 3. That's straightforward, 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next layer is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the third layer is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if this pattern continues. Let me write down each step as I go along, so I don't get confused. Starting from the innermost: 1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. 3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. 4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. 5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. 6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. 7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. 8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. 9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. 10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572. Wait, hold on, let me double-check that. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Starting from the innermost, which is 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then the outermost layer is 3 times that. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, carryover 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9*3 = 27, carryover 2. 5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 is equal to (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Let me verify that: 30000 * 3 = 90000, 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in any of the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then 1 + 3*4 = 13. 1 + 3*13 = 40. 1 + 3*40 = 121. 1 + 3*121 = 364. 1 + 3*364 = 1093. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. 3*29524 = 88572.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the very inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. Wait, no, actually, each term is 1 plus 3 times the next expression. So, if I denote each nested part as a separate expression, maybe I can compute them one by one. Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. Let me number each layer from the inside out as layers 1 to 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count them. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is (1 + 3*(layer1)). Layer3 is (1 + 3*(layer2)), and so on until layer9, which is the outermost. So, we have 9 layers here. Let me compute each layer step by step. Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4 Layer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer9.

Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: 3 * 20000 = 60000 3 * 9000 = 27000 3 * 500 = 1500 3 * 24 = 72 Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000=87000, plus 1500=88500, plus 72=88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another expression). There are nine sets of parentheses here, right? Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Yep, nine layers. That means I need to compute from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3), and then work my way out. Let me start by writing each step as I go along. Let's label each layer from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12. Then, Layer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39. Layer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120. Layer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363. Layer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 1 + 363 = 364. Finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364. Hmm, let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So, the total should be 1092. Wait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 is definitely 4. Layer 2: 3*4 is 12. Layer 3: 1 + 12 is 13. Layer 4: 3*13 is 39. Layer 5: 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 6: 3*40 is 120. Layer 7: 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 8: 3*121 is 363. Layer 9: 1 + 363 is 364. Then, the final multiplication: 3*364. Let me calculate 364*3 again. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. That seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to confirm the answer. Let's see, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider that each step is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, which is the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3. So, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wait a second, this seems different from before. Did I make a mistake here? Let me check. Wait, in my initial approach, I stopped at Layer 9 as 364, but here, a_5 is 364, which would correspond to Layer 9 in the initial approach. Then, a_6 would be 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. But in the original problem, after Layer 9, we have an outermost multiplication by 3. So, perhaps my initial approach was correct, and this second approach is a bit different. Wait, let me clarify. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, in terms of a_n, where a_1 is the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, which is the expression inside the outermost 3*. So, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_1 to a_9:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524. Let's compute that: 3*29524. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that's a different answer than before. Hmm, I must have confused the number of layers. Let me check the original problem again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, let's see: The innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's see: Starting from the inside:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: because the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... 9 times ...))) So, actually, the expression has 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", each nested inside the previous one, and then the outermost 3*(...). So, in terms of a_n, where a_1 is the innermost (1 + 3), then a_2 is 1 + 3*a_1, up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8, and then the total is 3*a_9. So, in my first approach, I computed up to Layer 9 as 364, then multiplied by 3 to get 1092. But in the second approach, I went up to a_9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Clearly, these are different results, so I must have miscounted the number of layers in my first approach. Let me recount the layers. The original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" occurrences. Starting from the left, after the first 3, each time we have \"1 + 3(\" as a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...1 + 3(...\n3. ...1 + 3(...\n4. ...1 + 3(...\n5. ...1 + 3(...\n6. ...1 + 3(...\n7. ...1 + 3(...\n8. ...1 + 3(...\n9. ...1 + 3(...\n\nAfter that, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer. So, there are 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", meaning that a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, in my first approach, I incorrectly stopped at a_9 as 364, but actually, I need to compute up to a_9 as 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Wait, but in my first approach, I thought there were only 9 layers, but now I'm seeing that perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's write it with more parentheses clarity:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). The innermost is (1 + 3), and then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let's count the number of 3*(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(...)\n3. 3*(...)\n4. 3*(...)\n5. 3*(...)\n6. 3*(...)\n7. 3*(...)\n8. 3*(...)\n9. 3*(...)\n10. 3*(...)\n\nWait, but the expression starts with 3*(...), so the first 3* is the outermost, and then each subsequent 3* is a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 39\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 120\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 363\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 364\n\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 1092\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 10 layers? But the original expression only has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" introduces a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\", which means 9 layers of nesting. Therefore, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 39\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 120\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 363\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 364\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, so in my second approach earlier, I mistakenly went up to a_9 as 29524, which would be if there were 10 layers, but actually, there are only 9 layers. So, my initial approach was correct with 1092 as the answer. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 1092.\n\nBut to make sure, let me compute it step by step again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(4) = 12\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 12) = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(13) = 39\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 39) = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(40) = 120\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 120) = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(121) = 363\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 363) = 364\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*364 = 1092.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers, but now I'm confident that the answer is 1092.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we can write a recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, we can compute up to a_9.\n\nLet's compute each a_n:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but this is conflicting with my previous conclusion. So, according to this, a_9 is 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. But this contradicts my earlier step-by-step approach. What's going on here?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is about how the layers are defined. If a_1 is the innermost (1 + 3), then each subsequent a_n is built by 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, the total is 3*a_9, where a_9 is 29524, leading to 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I stopped at Layer 9 as 364, then multiplied by 3 to get 1092. But according to the recurrence, a_9 is 29524, leading to 88572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I mislabeled the layers. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, Layer 2 is 3*(Layer 1) = 12.\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + Layer 2 = 13.\n\nLayer 4 is 3*(Layer 3) = 39.\n\nLayer 5 is 1 + Layer 4 = 40.\n\nLayer 6 is 3*(Layer 5) = 120.\n\nLayer 7 is 1 + Layer 6 = 121.\n\nLayer 8 is 3*(Layer 7) = 363.\n\nLayer 9 is 1 + Layer 8 = 364.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication is 3*(Layer 9) = 1092.\n\nSo, in this approach, Layer 9 is 364, and the total is 3*364 = 1092.\n\nBut in the recurrence approach, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524, and then 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nSo, which is correct? The discrepancy arises from how we define the layers. If the recurrence starts with a_1 = 4, then each a_n corresponds to one layer outward, and after 9 layers, we have a_9 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach, I stopped at Layer 9 as 364, then multiplied by 3. So, perhaps the confusion is whether the outermost multiplication by 3 is considered a layer or not.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine \"1 + 3(\" layers. So, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds 1 + 3*(...), and finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, the number of \"1 + 3(\" layers is 9, which would correspond to 9 a_n terms, starting from a_1 = 4, up to a_9 = 29524, and then the total is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step approach, I considered the outermost multiplication as Layer 9, which led to a different result.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the expression has 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", each nested inside the previous one, and the entire expression is then multiplied by 3.\n\nThus, using the recurrence:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29524\n\nThen, the total is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572, not 1092.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step approach, I only went up to Layer 9 as 364, which was after 8 layers, not 9. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nLet me try to count the layers again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12\n\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 39\n\nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 120\n\nLayer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 363\n\nLayer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 364\n\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 1092\n\nBut the original expression only has 9 layers of \"1 + 3(\", so the outermost multiplication by 3 is not part of the layers, it's just the final step. Therefore, in the expression, after 9 layers of \"1 + 3(\", we have the outermost 3*(...). So, in terms of the recurrence, a_9 would be 29524, and the total is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial approach, I considered the outermost multiplication as Layer 10, but in reality, it's just the final step after 9 layers. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting conflicting results. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's parse it from the inside out:\n\nStart with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward: 3*(4) = 12\n\nThen: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen: 3*13 = 39\n\nThen: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen: 3*40 = 120\n\nThen: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nThen: 3*121 = 363\n\nThen: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen: 3*364 = 1092\n\nThen: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nThen: 3*1093 = 3279\n\nThen: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nThen: 3*3280 = 9840\n\nThen: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen: 3*9841 = 29523\n\nThen: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers of \"1 + 3(\", so after the innermost (1 + 3), there are 8 more \"1 + 3(\" layers, making it 9 in total. So, the computation should stop at 3*(1 + 3*(...)) after 9 layers, which would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach was incorrect because I stopped too early, considering only 9 steps including the outermost multiplication, but in reality, the outermost multiplication is the 10th step, but the layers are only 9 of \"1 + 3(\".\n\nSo, to clarify, each \"1 + 3(\" is a layer, and there are 9 of them, so we compute up to the 9th layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut to make sure, let me write out each step clearly:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 3*(4) = 12\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 12 = 13\n\n4. Layer 4: 3*(13) = 39\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 39 = 40\n\n6. Layer 6: 3*(40) = 120\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 120 = 121\n\n8. Layer 8: 3*(121) = 363\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 363 = 364\n\n10. Final step: 3*(364) = 1092\n\nWait, but according to this, after 9 layers, we have 364, then the final multiplication by 3 gives 1092. But this contradicts the recurrence approach where a_9 = 29524.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the outermost multiplication is considered a layer or not. If the layers are defined as the \"1 + 3(\" parts, then there are 9 of them, and the final multiplication is just 3*(result of 9 layers). So, in that case, the answer would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach above, after 9 layers, we have 364, then multiply by 3 to get 1092. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression again, carefully:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n3*(4) = 12\n\nThen:\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\n3*(13) = 39\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\n3*(40) = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\n3*(121) = 363\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\n3*(364) = 1092\n\n1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3*(1093) = 3279\n\n1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3*(3280) = 9840\n\n1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3*(9841) = 29523\n\n1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers of \"1 + 3(\", so after the innermost (1 + 3), there are 8 more \"1 + 3(\" layers, making it 9 in total. So, after computing up to the 9th layer, which is 1 + 3*(...), we have 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut in the step-by-step above, I went beyond 9 layers, which is not correct. So, perhaps I need to stop at 9 layers.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(4) = 12\n\n3. 1 + 12 = 13\n\n4. 3*(13) = 39\n\n5. 1 + 39 = 40\n\n6. 3*(40) = 120\n\n7. 1 + 120 = 121\n\n8. 3*(121) = 363\n\n9. 1 + 363 = 364\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*(364) = 1092.\n\nWait, but according to this, after 9 layers, we have 364, then multiply by 3 to get 1092. But earlier, using the recurrence, after 9 layers, we have 29524, leading to 88572.\n\nI think the confusion is that in the step-by-step, each time we have \"1 + 3*(...)\", that's a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 39\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 120\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 363\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 364\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*(Layer 9) = 1092.\n\nSo, in this case, the 9 layers bring us to 364, then the final multiplication by 3 gives 1092.\n\nBut in the recurrence approach, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, after 9 layers, a_9 = 29524, leading to 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nSo, which is correct? I think the key is how we define the layers. If each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a layer, then the number of layers is 9, and the final step is multiplying by 3. Therefore, the answer is 1092.\n\nBut in the recurrence approach, we have a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, ..., a_9 = 29524, leading to 88572.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the outermost multiplication is considered part of the layers or not. If the layers are the \"1 + 3*(...)\" parts, then there are 9 of them, and the outermost multiplication is just 3*(result). So, in that case, the answer is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach, I counted each \"1 + 3*(...)\" as a layer, and after 9 layers, I had 364, then multiplied by 3 to get 1092. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the \"1 + 3*(...)\" is the first layer, then each subsequent \"1 + 3*(...)\" is another layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 39\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 120\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 363\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 364\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*(Layer 9) = 1092.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1092.\n\nBut in the recurrence approach, a_9 = 29524, which would be if we had 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", but in reality, after 9 layers, we have 364, and then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is 1092.\n\nBut to resolve this, let's consider the structure of the expression:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n3*(4) = 12\n\nThen:\n\n1 + 12 = 13\n\n3*(13) = 39\n\n1 + 39 = 40\n\n3*(40) = 120\n\n1 + 120 = 121\n\n3*(121) = 363\n\n1 + 363 = 364\n\n3*(364) = 1092\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 1092.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1092.\n\nI think the confusion earlier was because in the recurrence approach, I considered a_9 as 29524, which would be if we had 9 layers beyond the initial 3*. But in reality, the expression has 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\", starting from the innermost, leading to 364, then multiplied by 3 to get 1092.\n\nSo, to confirm, let's compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Start with (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. Multiply by 3: 3*4 = 12\n\n3. Add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\n4."

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, counting the number of 3s and parentheses, I think there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). Let me check: Starting from the left, each time I see a 3 followed by a (1 + 3(...)), and this repeats until the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). So, yes, there are nine layers here. Maybe it's easier if I label each layer to keep track. Let me assign each innermost expression a variable or a number and work my way outwards. Let's start from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that innermost part. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the second layer from the inside is 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which was 13. So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the third layer is 40. Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, the fourth layer is 121. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. The fifth layer is 364. Next, the sixth layer would be 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. The sixth layer is 1093. Now, the seventh layer is 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute that: 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. The seventh layer is 3280. Moving out another layer, the eighth layer is 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. The eighth layer is 9841. Finally, the ninth layer, which is the outermost one, is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, the ninth layer is 29524. Now, remember that each layer is multiplied by 3 in the overall expression. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3 times the first layer. Wait, let me check the original problem again: It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the first layer, which is 29524. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29000 is 87000, 3*524 is 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from the innermost part: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the steps. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the innermost expression, substituting it into the next layer, and repeating until the entire expression is simplified. \n\nStarting with the innermost part:\n1. \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThe result of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so starting from the very inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. \n\nSo, (1 + 3) is 4. That part is straightforward. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that down:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(innermost result) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, so 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Let me keep track of this because it's easy to get lost with so many layers. So far, I've simplified three layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*40.\n\nCalculating that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121. Let me note that as the fourth layer.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, fifth layer is 364.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate that. 3*364 is... Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, sixth layer is 1093.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute that. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, seventh layer is 3280.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Eighth layer is 9841.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nContinuing outward, next layer is 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Ninth layer is 29524.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. So, adding those: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. Tenth layer is 88573.\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nWait, hold on, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression starts with 3(1 + 3(...)) and each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It seems like there are nine opening parentheses, which would mean nine layers. Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: there are nine closing parentheses after the last 1 + 3. So, that would mean there are nine layers. So, I think I might have gone one layer too far.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, each corresponding to the nine closing parentheses. So, after computing the ninth layer, we get 29524. But the original expression is 3 multiplied by that ninth layer. So, after computing the innermost nine layers, we have 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, I think I went one layer too far before, because I thought there were ten layers, but actually, it's nine layers inside, and then the outermost 3*(...). Let me correct that.\n\nSo, after computing the ninth layer, we have 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier step where I thought the tenth layer was 88573. That was a mistake because I incorrectly included an extra layer. So, actually, the ninth layer is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, the outermost 3 multiplies this result. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, when I computed up to the ninth layer, I thought it was 29524, and then 3*29524 is 88572. So, that should be the final answer.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this by perhaps using a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern here that can be expressed as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with the closed-form formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59049 -1=59048/2=29524, as before.\n\nSo, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but that might complicate things. I think the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation both lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each step again quickly:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the final multiplication by 3 gives the result.

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Okay, so I count nine sets of parentheses. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times another expression. Let me try to count the number of threes. Hmm, each opening parenthesis after the first one has a 3 multiplied by another expression. So maybe each layer adds another 3, but I'm not sure yet. Let me start by simplifying the innermost part first. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's simple enough. Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part becomes 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that innermost part. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So that layer is 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me write down the results so far to see if I can spot a pattern or a formula. So far:\n\n- Layer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but let me check that. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations because each time I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so perhaps each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about it. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, that seems correct because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, to find a_n, we can solve this recurrence relation. Let me recall how to solve linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers:\n\n- For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n- For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n- For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n- For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold. Now, since our expression has nine layers, starting from the innermost as layer 1, up to layer 9. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which would be a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10 first. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, verifying the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Sum: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n- 0 * 3 = 0 + 2 = 2.\n- 0 * 3 = 0.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By simplifying from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be represented by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result: 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, I count nine sets of parentheses, so there are nine layers to solve. That sounds a bit tedious, but maybe there's a pattern I can exploit instead of computing each layer individually. Let me start by labeling each layer from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's a non-homogeneous one because of the constant term. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because our layers are all positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check. The particular solution method: if the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution. So, assume L_p = A, where A is a constant. Then, plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Hmm, same result. So, the general solution is L_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, that's Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40. Seems like the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, Layer 9 is (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I can also think about this problem as a geometric series, but given the structure, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to see it as a sum of powers of 3, but I think the way I did it is solid. So, yeah, I'm confident the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9, which equals 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))). Hmm, so there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with 1 plus 3 times another set. I think the best way to approach this is to start simplifying from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I label each layer from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9, I can compute each step by step. Let's define each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually looking back, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe the layers are actually starting from the innermost as Layer 1 and building up to Layer 9, with each Layer n being 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). But let me confirm that. Let me write out the layers explicitly.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), but let me check the structure again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So I need to compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, each time plugging the result into the next layer, and then multiply the final result by 3.

So 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, let me confirm that.\n\nActually, the standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, with L_0 given.\n\nIn this case, a = 3, b = 1.\n\nSo, the solution is L_n = 3^n * L_0 + (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) * b.\n\nWait, but in our case, L_1 = 4. Let me see if that fits.\n\nWait, actually, let's adjust the indices. Since L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0, where L_0 would be 1? Wait, no, because L_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3. So perhaps L_1 = 4, and the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, in that case, the general solution would be L_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find the particular solution, assume L_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 1, L_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n = 2, L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check this using another approach to be absolutely sure. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nLooking back, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the expression, it's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWhich is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some term? Wait, no, not exactly. Because each layer adds 1 and then 3 times the previous, it's more like each layer is 1 + 3*(sum of previous terms). Hmm, maybe not a straightforward geometric series, but perhaps I can express it as such.\n\nWait, but using the recurrence relation, we've already found that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the entire expression. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I let E be the entire expression, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). But wait, the inner expression is similar to E, except that E is 3*(...), whereas the inner part is 1 + 3*(...). Let me denote the inner part as F, where F = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so E = 3*F.\n\nBut F itself is 1 + 3*F', where F' is another similar expression, but this seems to go on. Wait, but in reality, F is the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3, so maybe this approach isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can model E in terms of itself, but given that the nesting is finite (9 layers), it's better to stick with the step-by-step approach or the recurrence relation.\n\nAnother way is to recognize that each time you add a layer, you're effectively adding another term in a geometric progression. Let me try expanding the entire expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I expand this, it's:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) )) )\n\nLet me try expanding it step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, I can see that each layer adds a power of 3.\n\nWait, from the recurrence, we saw that L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So I think my answer is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this, we determine that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
