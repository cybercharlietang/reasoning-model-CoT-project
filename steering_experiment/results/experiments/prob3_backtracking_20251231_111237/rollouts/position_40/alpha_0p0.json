    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, that seems quite large. Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting again from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3 * 29524: Let's compute this more carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60,000; 9000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers or miscalculate a step. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute an extra one. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: Each \"1+3(\" is a layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. From the innermost to the outermost, there are nine instances of \"1+3(\" before the final closing. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each adding another layer. So, my calculation of nine layers is correct. Therefore, my step-by-step computation is accurate, and the final answer is indeed 88,572. I think that's it. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and recompute each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me count the opening parentheses: Each time I see a (, it's a new layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a new layer. Let me count the number of 1+3 inside:\n\nFrom the innermost, we have 1+3, then each time we have another (1+3(...)). Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3.\n\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each time we go out, it's another layer. So, if I have 1+3(...), and the innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let me count the number of 1+3 inside the parentheses. Each time, the expression is 1+3 followed by another set of parentheses. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\nContinuing this way, up to 9 layers because there are nine sets of parentheses. So, each layer adds another 1+3. Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, getting 88572, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, which seems correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check if I made a mistake in the layers. Let me compute each layer again to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute this again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a different method to be sure. Maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3 times the entire expression. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each ( is a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, let's count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions:\n\nFrom the innermost, each time we go out, we have another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3.\n\n- Then, moving out, it's 1+3(1+3).\n\n- Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3)).\n\nAnd so on, until we reach the outermost expression.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears inside the parentheses. Let me count the number of 1+3 inside:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the initial 3, we have a 1+3 followed by another set of parentheses. Let me count how many times 1+3 appears as a separate term inside the parentheses.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until we have 9 layers because there are nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3. So, the innermost is the first layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. Therefore, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1+3 term. So, my initial calculation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nTherefore, computing up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when I computed Layer 9, I correctly used Layer 8's value. Let me check each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer's result was used correctly in the next layer, and the final multiplication by 3 gives the final answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the solution to the homogeneous equation plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, to find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so this formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. But just to be thorough, let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead. Looking at the layers, each layer n is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a recurrence relation, and it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is straightforward. However, for practice, let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1: 1 + 3). This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches Layer 3. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have nine layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} = 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So both methods agree, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the expansion of (3^{n} - 1)/2, but I think the way I approached it step by step is clearer for someone just starting out. In summary, by methodically computing each layer from the inside out and verifying with a closed-form formula, I arrived at the solution. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4.

Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: Multiply each digit by 3, starting from the right: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, carryover 0. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I did it step by step, I think I might have made a mistake in the carryover. Let me write it out vertically:\n\n     29524\n   x    3\n   -------\n     88572\n\nYes, that's correct. 29524 *3 is 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me list them again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 =13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found as follows.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation. So, the expression inside is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it both by expanding each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation. Both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step until reaching the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's understandable. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's interesting how the formula approach can provide a quicker way to compute the result without manually calculating each layer, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, it's manageable either way. I guess another way to think about this is that each layer is a geometric series, but in this case, since each term depends on the previous one, the recurrence relation approach is more straightforward. Anyway, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer after verifying both by step-by-step computation and by using the recurrence relation formula.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is actually 88572? Let me verify that multiplication to be sure.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.

So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have been faster or reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It's similar to a geometric series, but each term is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let's see: Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1. Wait, no, actually, in this case, the innermost term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, that seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's compute a_1: a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, as a_3=40. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation of Layer 9 being 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirmed the result we got by step-by-step computation. This method might have been more efficient, especially if the expression had more layers, as it avoids manually computing each layer. However, since there were only nine layers, both methods were manageable. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, and the answer seems consistent across different methods. I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

Let me compute it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me write it out vertically:\n\n      29524\n    x      3\n    ________\n      88572\n\nWait, 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: the next digit is 9, which is the ten-thousands place. Wait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, 4*3=12, 2*3=6+1=7, 5*3=15, 9*3=27+1=28, 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, the result is 88572. But wait, let me verify that Layer 9 was correctly computed as 29524. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, it's manageable to compute each one. I think I did it correctly. So the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next layer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes, when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to slip up. Let me go through each layer again more carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That's correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Right) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Good) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Yes) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Right) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Yes) Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved some time. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let's check: The innermost is Layer 1: a1 = 4. Then Layer 2: a2 = 13, Layer 3: 40, etc., up to Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9. So, using the formula, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our earlier computation. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without going through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But since the problem only had 9 layers, doing it step by step was manageable. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but for someone just starting out, computing each layer step by step is a good approach to avoid mistakes. I think that's all. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: Break it down digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So reading it from the top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Hmm, but let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Substitute the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, we have A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me try computing a few layers using the formula and see if they match. For example, Layer 5: n=5, L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364, which matches. Layer 7: n=7, L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: n=8, L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841, correct. So, everything checks out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Calculating the outermost layer (n=9) gives 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because 3 * 29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, I can compute it as 29524 * 3.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, which is what I got earlier. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the Layer 9 calculation. Let me go back and check each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). So, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I'm feeling uncertain because 88572 seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial layers. Let me try computing the expression in a different way, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This looks similar to a geometric series. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_i, where i is the layer number starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, I can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for such equations. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1. In this case, k = 3 and c = 1. Wait, but our initial term is a_1 = 4, not a_0. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3B \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me confirm if n=9 is correct. Since the innermost layer is a_1, and we have 9 layers, so a_9 is the outermost. Therefore, yes, a_9 = 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting with the innermost 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, after 9 layers, the innermost value is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute a few layers manually again: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7 7 8 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when multiplied by 3, the result should be 88572, which is a 5-digit number as well. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: Break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go back and check each step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all the steps seem correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to think about it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one.

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, and 3 * 4 = 12. Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the digit-wise multiplication.

Wait, that seems right. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7previous layer. This is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for this. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, where n ranges from 1 to 9. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3\u00d7L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A\u00d73^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. At n=1, L(1)=4: 4 = A\u00d73^1 + B \u2192 4 = 3A + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, if we consider the behavior, but maybe it's easier to compute the first few terms and see the pattern. Alternatively, we can compute L(n) step by step, which we did earlier, but perhaps recognizing the pattern can help us compute it more quickly. Looking at the values we got:\n\nL(1) = 4 = 3 + 1\n\nL(2) = 13 = 3\u00d74 + 1\n\nWait, actually, each term is 1 + 3\u00d7previous. So, each term is 3\u00d7previous + 1. So, L(n) = 3\u00d7L(n-1) + 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C\u00d73^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3\u00d7K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C\u00d73^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C\u00d73^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L(9), would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3\u00d7L(9)=3\u00d729524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the formula using the recurrence relation give the same result.

Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 3*29524. Let me break it down again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems a bit large, but considering the number of layers, maybe it's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me check this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is Layer 1, n=1, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, since each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, starting from 4, and we have 9 layers, we can compute it using the formula, which gives the same result. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Hmm, same result. So, the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because that number seems quite large. Let's verify each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the expression is 3*a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSubstitute a_{n-1} = C*3^{n-1} + D:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nBut according to the general solution, a_n = C*3^n + D. So, equating the two expressions:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolve for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is building a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the total might be a geometric series with ratio 3 and nine terms. But I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the expression step by step again, but this time using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for each layer:\n\nLayer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: n=4, a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: n=5, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: n=6, a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: n=7, a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: n=8, a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, everything still checks out. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form formula and compute each layer, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because when I did Layer 9, I might have made a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 3 * 29524. Let's compute this again step by step to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. From the innermost to the outermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another. Let's see: The innermost is the last (1+3), then moving outward, each time another layer. So, how many layers? Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, then another 1+3(...), etc. Let me try to count them. The innermost is 1+3, then one layer above that is 1+3*(1+3), then the next is 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on, until we have nine layers. Wait, because each time we have a 1+3*(...), and the entire expression is 3*(...), so the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, which is multiplied by 3. So, nine layers in total. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, getting 88572, that should be correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be error-prone. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it without having to go through each layer manually. That's probably a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, using the formula, we can find that the value is 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Maybe I miscounted the layers or miscalculated one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) So, up to Layer 9, it's 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again to make sure. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Hmm, that's the same result as before.

So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, maybe that is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1+3(...)\" sections. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is one layer. Then each time, we have another 1+3(, so each adds a layer. Let me count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9, meaning there are 9 layers. So, my initial approach was correct, with 9 layers. So, each layer from 1 to 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, perhaps that's the correct answer. But wait, let me check another way. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for such a nested expression. Let's see. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, etc., up to L9. Then, E = 3*L9. So, each Li = 1 + 3*Li-1, starting from L1 = 4. So, this is a recursive relation: Li = 1 + 3*Li-1, with L1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for Li. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving Li - 3*Li-1 = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is Li = 3*Li-1 + 1. That's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Li - 3*Li-1 = 0, which has the solution Li = C*3^i. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Li = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is Li = C*3^i - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When i=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Li = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^(i+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(i+1) - 1)/2. So, Li = (3^(i+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier results. For i=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For i=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For i=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For i=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For i=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For i=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For i=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For i=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For i=9: L9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, E = 3*L9 = 3*(29524)=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^10 -1)/2, then E=3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's find another condition. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 13 = 9A + B. Now, we have two equations: 1) 4 = 3A + B 2) 13 = 9A + B Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (13 - 4) = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into equation 1: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1)/2. So, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. Let me see. Since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the expression becomes 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Because 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*1 = 3. So, (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer, 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recalculate each layer to ensure I didn't make any errors. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think if this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each term is built upon the previous. Let's see if we can find a pattern or a closed-form formula. Let's compute the first few terms:\n\na1 = 4\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, a9 is 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a9 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a way to represent this recursively or with a formula? Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the known values. For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have n=9 layers. So, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by a recurrence relation.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. There's a 2 at the beginning, so 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: the leading 9 (wait, no, the number is 29524, so digits are 2,9,5,2,4.

Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3: Let me compute it more carefully. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So the number is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

So that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. But just to explore, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute each layer without manually calculating each step, which is efficient. But since the problem only had nine layers, step-by-step computation was manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the step-by-step result.

Then, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, which resembles a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model this as a geometric sequence and find a formula. Let me see. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, I think. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n + c = 1 + 3(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's better to solve it step by step. Alternatively, we can write the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for such equations. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me more confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to building a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of a sum. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). If I expand this, each layer adds a term that's 3^k, where k is the number of layers. Wait, maybe that's a different approach. Let me try to see. The innermost term is 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 +3*4=13. Then, the next layer is 1 +3*13=40, and so on. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous total). So, if I think of this as a sum, each term is 3^{n} where n is the number of layers from the innermost. But I'm not sure if that's the right way. Alternatively, maybe the total expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=9, but I need to verify. Wait, let me think differently. Since each layer is a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, as we saw. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (3^{11} -3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, this alternative approach also confirms that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus three times the next layer. Starting from the innermost layer, each layer is computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression, leading to the final computation.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost outward**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 3*3=9. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, that seems reasonable. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 3*3=9. Wait, that's 7 digits, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so maybe I made a mistake in the number of digits. Wait, 29524 is 5 digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when I multiply by 3, I should have:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, that's 88572. Wait, but that's 5 digits: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable and less error-prone. Another way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is following the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result using a different method. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me check my layers again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). This looks similar to a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see how that works. So, a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, that matches what I did earlier. So, after computing up to a_9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition to find D. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + D = 3C + D. Also, for the recurrence relation, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant D. Let me find D by plugging in the recurrence into the equation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's substitute the general solution into this:\n\na_n = C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D.\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D.\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D.\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I can compute 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 directly. Let's see:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\n3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that the expression is a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. But since each term is built upon the previous one, it's a bit more involved. But using the recurrence relation and solving it with the closed-form formula gives the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Recognize that the expression is a nested set of terms where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost (Layer 1) up to the outermost (Layer 9).\n\n3. Alternatively, model the layers using a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 =4.\n\n4. Solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula, which gives a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\n5. For n=9, compute a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\n6. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all adds up. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me try to model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the nth layer, starting from the innermost as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.

Maybe I made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nThe standard solution for a linear recurrence a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = k^{n-1}*(a_1 + c/(1 - k)) - c/(1 - k)\n\nIn this case, a_1 = 4, k = 3, c = 1.\n\nSo,\n\na_n = 3^{n-1}*(4 + 1/(1 - 3)) - 1/(1 - 3)\n\n= 3^{n-1}*(4 - 1/2) - (-1/2)\n\n= 3^{n-1}*(7/2) + 1/2\n\nWait, that's what I had before. But when n=2,\n\na_2 = 3^{1}*(7/2) + 1/2 = 3*(7/2) + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11, which contradicts my earlier calculation where a_2 was 13.\n\nSo, there must be a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula I'm using is for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c =1 and k=3.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final step is to compute 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) *3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 +24*3\n\n=60000 +27000 +1500 +72\n\n=60000 +27000 =87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +72=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer's result. After computing up to the ninth layer, the result is multiplied by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without doing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. But just to be thorough, let me see if I can find a pattern or a recursive formula here. Each layer n is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is Layer n = a*Layer(n-1) + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. The formula is Layer n = (a^(n) * (Layer 0) + b*(a^(n) - 1)/(a - 1)). Wait, but in our case, Layer 1 is 4, so maybe we need to adjust the formula accordingly. Let me recall the formula for such a recurrence. For a recurrence relation of the form x_n = a*x_{n-1} + b, with x_1 = c, the solution is x_n = a^{n-1}*c + b*(a^{n-1} - 1)/(a - 1). Let me check that. Yes, that's correct. So in our case, a=3, b=1, and c=4 (since Layer 1 = 4). So, Layer n = 3^{n-1}*4 + 1*(3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1). Simplifying, Layer n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Combining terms: Layer n = (8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} - 1)/2 = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify this formula with the layers I computed. For n=1: Layer 1 = (9*3^{0} -1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2 = (8)/2=4. Correct. For n=2: Layer 2 = (9*3^{1} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (9*9 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (9*27 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, Layer n = (9*3^{n-1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9: n=9, so Layer 9 = (9*3^{8} -1)/2. Let's compute that. First, 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 9*6561=59049. Then, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*( (9*3^{8} -1)/2 )= (27*3^{8} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{8}=6561, so 27*6561=27*6561. Let me compute that: 27*6000=162000, 27*500=13500, 27*61=1647. Adding up: 162000+13500=175500, +1647=177147. So, 27*3^8=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2: 177144/2=88572. Same result. So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any arithmetic errors. Let me verify each multiplication: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Yes. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Yes. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Yes. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Yes. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Yes. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Yes. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Yes. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let me write that as equation (1): 3A + B = 4. Now, let's find another equation. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general formula: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 9A + B = 13. That's equation (2): 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, substitute A back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer adds another factor of 3, so perhaps the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). This seems similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to express it that way. Let me denote S as the entire expression: S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). The innermost part is 1 + 3 = 4, then each layer adds another 3*(previous layer). But since each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit different from a standard geometric series. However, using the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward. I think I've already confirmed the answer using both iterative computation and the recurrence formula, so I can be confident that 88,572 is the correct result. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29,524, I multiply that by 3 to get the final result of 88,572. All steps check out, and the formula approach corroborates the manual computation. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using this, we determine that the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result should be 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute one or two layers again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Let's check Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. So, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, that gives me 87572. Wait, that's different from my earlier result. Did I do that correctly? Wait, let's write it out:\n\n29524\ntimes     3\n________\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2\nBut wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, I must have miscounted the digits earlier. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\ntimes 3\n= ?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. That matches my initial calculation. So, I think I was correct the first time. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify by another method. Maybe using a different approach to compute the expression, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Specifically, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572. That gives me more confidence that my initial step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me explore that approach as well.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*(something), and the \"something\" is another similar expression. If I expand this, it's similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I let x be the innermost expression, then x = 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3x, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3x), and so on. But perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, considering the expression as a geometric series with ratio 3.\n\nWait, let's try to express the entire expression as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))) with nine layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). If I let the innermost part be 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, as I did before. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each layer adds another 3^k term. Let me see:\n\nFrom the closed-form formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121\nWait, I'm not sure if expanding it as a sum will help. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each layer is contributing a term of 3^{k}.\n\nWait, from the closed-form solution, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))), which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4)))), since the innermost is 4.\n\nIf I expand this, each layer adds another 3^k term. Let me see:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nLet me try to expand this step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nE = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, regardless of the approach, I end up with 88,572 as the result.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression using another method, such as converting it into a summation.\n\nLooking at the closed-form formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's see: Each layer adds a term that's 3^{k}.\n\nWait, starting from the innermost, which is 3^1, then each layer adds another 3^{k}.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(3^1 + 1) = 1 + 3^2 + 3^1 = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3^2 + 3^1) = 1 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 = 1 + 27 + 9 + 3 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(1 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1) = 1 + 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 = 1 + 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 = 121\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nSo, in general, each layer n adds terms 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n, plus 1.\n\nWait, but the expression is built as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which actually results in a sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n.\n\nWait, let me check for Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 3^0 + 3^1.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nSo, each layer n adds up to 3^n terms. Thus, after 9 layers, the innermost expression would be the sum up to 3^9, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the entire expression is 3*(sum up to 3^9). Let me see:\n\nIf each layer n is sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, then after 9 layers, the innermost sum would be sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k.\n\nBut in our case, the expression is 3*(sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k).\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nsum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our previous results.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method I use\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using a recurrence relation, or recognizing it as a geometric series\u2014the result is the same: 88,572.\n\nJust to ensure that I haven't overlooked any potential mistake, I'll summarize the steps:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, starting with 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer as 1 + 3*(previous result).\n3. After computing up to Layer 9, which gives 29524, multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n4. Verify using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, confirming that a_9 = 29524.\n5. Multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n6. Cross-check using the sum of a geometric series, arriving at the same result.\n\nAll methods lead to the same conclusion, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.
