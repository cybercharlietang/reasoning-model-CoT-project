    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, and 3 * 4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations because 3*29524 should be correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check 3*29524 again using another method to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, I think I did that correctly. So, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, in case I made a mistake in the step-by-step. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something that could be expressed recursively. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier result. So, using the closed-form formula confirms that the result is indeed 88572. That gives me more confidence that I didn't make a mistake in the step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. So adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the result of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then 3*29524: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. So that seems correct. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly, so maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me verify 3*9841: 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Wait, that's different from what I had before. Oh no, I think I made a mistake in Layer 9. Let me go back. Layer 8: 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. So 3*9841: Let's compute that correctly. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then add 1: 29523 +1=29524. Oh, so that's correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 *3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 0*3=0 +2=2. 2*3=6. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as follows: 29524 *3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) *3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 +27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+72=88572. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's right. To make sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Looking at the structure, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 +3 =4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, in this problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1. The homogeneous part is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the initial terms to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9 layers, the value would be a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as before. So, this method confirms the result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading the digits from bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. Yep, that matches what I had before. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time we add 3 times the previous result. This seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Alternatively, since each a_n is built by adding 1 and three times the prior a, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches what I computed earlier. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. I know that 3^5 = 243, so 3^10 = (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243^2: 243*243. I can compute this as (240 +3)^2 = 240^2 + 2*240*3 +3^2 = 57600 + 1440 + 9 = 57600 + 1440 is 59040, plus 9 is 59049. So, 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula, I can compute it without going through each layer, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I was able to compute it step by step, that's reassuring. Just to make sure, let me verify the multiplication one more time: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing the digits from last to first: 8,8,5,7,2. So, 88572. Yep, same result.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. The general form is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. This is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The recurrence can be written as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the outermost expression would be 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the next inner layer.

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, actually, it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do that: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. There are no more digits, so write down 27 + 2? Wait, no, wait, let me do it properly. Let me write it out:\n\n  29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because each layer depends on the previous one, and if I messed up any layer, the final answer would be wrong.\n\nLet me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers seem correct. So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It's a geometric series perhaps? Let me see.\n\nLet me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general form is a_{n} = c*3^{n} + d, where c and d are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolve for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for n=9, which is Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can express this using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in this case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, which simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2 =88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. By solving this recurrence, we find that each layer a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the innermost layer (n=1), this results in 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the outermost value to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ", then 3 * 9524 = 28572. Adding those together: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Hmm, wait, is that correct? Let me check my calculations again, because 3*29524 should be 88572, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me think again. Is there a different way to approach this problem? Maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or recursion. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recursive relation. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, this formula works. So, for Layer 9, which is the innermost layer in our original problem, n=9. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in the original expression, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer wraps around, so Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), etc., up to Layer9, which is the innermost part of the original expression. But in our formula, L_n corresponds to the nth layer. So, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(Layer9). So, Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier computation. So, then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572, as we found before. Therefore, using the formula is much faster and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the recursive formula\u2014lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Using a recursive approach, each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\). Solving this recurrence relation gives the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the innermost layer (n=9), this results in 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 27. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572.

Alternatively, maybe it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_k.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me substitute L_k into the recurrence:\n\nL_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}\n\nAssume L_k = A*3^k + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation:\n\nA*3^k + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{k-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^k + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^k + B = 1 + A*3^k + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^k from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when k=1,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works.\n\nFor k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nFor k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nFor k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing a couple more layers using the formula to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nFor example, Layer 4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nLayer 5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nLayer 6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nLayer 7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nLayer 8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nLayer 9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nSo, all layers check out with the formula, which gives me confidence that my answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is essentially a geometric series. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which can be seen as a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.\n\nBut since each term is built from the previous one, the formula we derived earlier is more straightforward.\n\nIn summary, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing the pattern and deriving a formula for each layer, I was able to compute the value efficiently without having to manually calculate each of the nine layers, which would be time-consuming and prone to error.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, maybe it's easier to just do 29524 * 3 directly. Let me compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n________\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each step because sometimes when you compute layer by layer, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce errors. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but it's nested, so it's a bit different. Let me think about it. If I denote the innermost term as a1 = 1 + 3, then the next term a2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on, up to a9. Then the entire expression is 3*a9. So, the general formula is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but in this case, a1 is given. Wait, actually, let me see. Let's solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern.\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier. Now, to find a closed-form expression for a_n, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, so the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 3^10 is indeed 59049. Let's compute 3^10 step by step:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, a9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), starting from the innermost layer. Solving the recurrence relation reveals that each layer follows a geometric progression.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1=4, as we saw. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's what I computed earlier. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and then find a particular solution.\n\nFirst, write the recurrence as:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1\n\n-2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9. Wait, no, actually, in our case, the expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, we get 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer evaluates to 29524.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 another way to confirm. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the layers, let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, all layers are correct, and the final multiplication by 3 is correct. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recursive sequence, but given the small number of layers (nine), computing each step manually is manageable and probably less error-prone than trying to find a general formula. But just for fun, let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built from the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, that's exactly what I computed earlier. So, this approach aligns with the step-by-step computation. If I wanted to find a closed-form solution for a_n, I could solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, then substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplifying the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the closed-form solution also leads to the same result, which gives me even more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series but with an added constant. However, since each term is built upon the previous one, it's a linear recurrence rather than a simple geometric series. But knowing the closed-form solution helps in verifying the result without computing each layer manually. In summary, by computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, I arrived at the answer 88572. Additionally, by modeling the problem as a recurrence relation and finding its closed-form solution, I confirmed that the result is consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the computed value is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or compute an extra one. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: 1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, we add another layer. The original expression has nine layers, I think. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a \"(\", so let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, like a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that L_1 = 4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, let's assume L_0 = 1 (since if there were zero layers, it would just be 1). Plugging n=0: L_0 = A*3^0 + B = A + B = 1. So now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and A + B = 1. Subtracting the second equation from the first: (3A + B) - (A + B) = 4 - 1 => 2A = 3 => A = 3/2. Then, from A + B = 1, B = 1 - A = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2. So, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I'll compute one more layer manually to check if my recurrence relation is correct. Let's compute L_4 using both the step-by-step method and the formula. Step-by-step: L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Using the formula: L_4 = (3^{5})/2 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, I can be confident that my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13, which is correct. Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, that's right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, yes. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, yes. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to be the correct answer. But just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way, let me recompute each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent each time. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ", then 3 * 9524. Wait, 9524 is 9000 + 524. 3*9000 = 27000, and 3*524 = 1572. So, 27000 + 1572 = 28572. Then, adding that to 60000: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is actually 88572? Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I should do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 is 88572. Yes, that seems correct. But wait, I'm confused because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. From the inside:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n...\nWait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost. So, the computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check once more. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. The expression is a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, and 3 * 4 = 12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let's compute this more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 0*3=0. So, the result is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression from the inside out without labeling the layers, just to cross-verify. Let's try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.

Let me do it properly: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27.

Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 8 + 4 = 12, carryover 1. 4 + 2 +1=7. 0 +5=5. 9 +9=18, carryover 1. 5 +2 +1=8. 2 + nothing=2. So it's 88572.

Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So that seems to check out. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, writing down each layer as I go. Let me try that again: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 +12=13. Next layer: 1 +3*(13)=1+39=40. Next: 1 +3*(40)=1+120=121. Next: 1 +3*(121)=1+363=364. Next: 1 +3*(364)=1+1092=1093. Next: 1 +3*(1093)=1+3279=3280. Next: 1 +3*(3280)=1+9840=9841. Next: 1 +3*(9841)=1+29523=29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3*a_1=1+12=13, a_3=1+3*a_2=1+39=40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the solution to the homogeneous equation plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form solution give the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write it as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^p = B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Great, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and the general formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Expanding this, it's like 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine terms? Wait, but actually, since each layer is multiplied by 3 each time, it's more like a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of a sum. Let me denote S as the entire expression, so S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. If I let S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), then the inner part is similar to S but divided by 3, maybe? Wait, actually, if I let the inner expression be S', then S = 3*(1 + 3*S'). But S' itself is similar, so maybe this approach isn't as straightforward. Alternatively, using the formula I found earlier, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then S = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, S = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same final answer of 88572.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check my multiplication again because 3 * 29524 might be easier to compute as 3*(29000 + 524) = 3*29000 + 3*524. 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572.

Correct)\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. As before, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but given the multiple layers of multiplication, it might be correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which would be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, no, actually, the innermost term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous term multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} and solving it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series might also work, but the recurrence relation approach seems straightforward here. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the value of 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step and then verifying using the recurrence relation method, I'm confident that the final result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but it's always good to double-check, especially with so many layers involved. It's easy to get lost in the parentheses and make an arithmetic error, but by breaking it down and using a formulaic approach, I was able to manage it effectively.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, and 3 * 4 = 12. Wait, but actually, 29524 is 29,524. Let me compute 3 * 29,524 properly. 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. 29,524 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n__________\n(4 * 3) = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n(2 * 3) = 6 + 1 = 7.\n(5 * 3) = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n(9 * 3) = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n(2 * 3) = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that would be 88,572? Hmm, but 29,524 * 3 is actually 88,572. Let me verify with another method. 29,524 * 3: 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, but 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 90,000 - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with multiple layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 + 9 = 3,279. Then, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which we calculated as 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to make sure, let me try computing the entire expression step by step without layers, to see if I get the same result. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nStart with the innermost 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and each step follows logically from the previous one. It's just a matter of carefully computing each nested layer and making sure that each multiplication and addition is done correctly. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time helps prevent errors.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, starting with 1 + 3, then substituting that result into the next layer, and so on, until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Substitute into the next layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Continue substituting each layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n4. Multiply the outermost result by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I think I can be confident that 88572 is the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, doing it manually isn't too bad. I wonder if there's a recursive formula or something with geometric series here. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. But maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, it works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

So, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f. Then Layer 8: 3*3280. Let me compute 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f. Layer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f. Finally, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step as I did is manageable. However, for completeness, let me try to find a general formula. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, the formula confirms my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the general formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation. Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ", then 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, and 3 * 4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524*3. Let me break it down again: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since the number of layers is manageable, step-by-step computation seems feasible. Alternatively, this kind of nested expression resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that for a second. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Solving such a recurrence can be done using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. In our case, a = 3 and b = 1. Wait, but our first term is L_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. So maybe L_0 would be 1. Let me check. If n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0. If L_0 is 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, the general formula would be L_n = 3^{n} * L_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Since L_0 = 1, this simplifies to L_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Combining the terms: L_n = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we have L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using the formula confirms the result I obtained step by step. That's reassuring. I think I'm confident now that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ", then 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, and 3 * 4 = 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, 29524 is 29,524. So, 3 * 29,524. Let me compute it step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 30,000 *3 = 90,000. Then subtract (30,000 - 29,524)=476, so 476*3=1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Hmm, that's the same result. So, 3*29,524=88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Now, multiply by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. That seems correct. But wait, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524, but when I multiply by 3, I get 88,572. However, when I first computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29,524, but let me check again. Wait, 3*9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. So that's correct. Then, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I compute each layer, the numbers are growing exponentially, which makes sense because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, leading to a geometric progression. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That's consistent with what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents. 3^1 is 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524: Let me compute it again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, 29,524 * 3 can be computed as (30,000 - 476) *3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Either way, the result is the same.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3*29524 should be 88572, but let me double-check the multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, actually, when you write down the multiplication, the digits are written from right to left, so the first digit is 2, then 7, then 5, then 8, then 7, then 8, then 7, then 2? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nLet me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 =7. Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 =15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 \u00d73=27 +1=28.

Write down 7, carry over1.\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73=6 +1=7. Write down7.\n\nSo, writing from right to left, the digits are 2,7,5,8,7,8,7,2? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Wait, 29524 \u00d73: Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as follows:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nFirst, 4 \u00d73=12. So, 2 with a carryover of 1.\n\nNext, 2 \u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nNext, 5 \u00d73=15. So, 5 with a carryover of1.\n\nNext, 9 \u00d73=27 +1=28. So, 8 with a carryover of2.\n\nNext, 2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, we have a carryover of2? Wait, no, because 29,524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so after the 2, we're done. So the multiplication would be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover1\n2\u00d73=6+1=7 \u21927, carryover0\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover1\n9\u00d73=27+1=28 \u21928, carryover2\n2\u00d73=6+2=8 \u21928, carryover0\nNow, since there are no more digits, we add the carryover, which is 0, so we're done.\n\nSo the result is 88,572. Wait, that's 88,572. Let me check: 29,524 \u00d73=88,572. Yes, because 30,000 \u00d73=90,000, so 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So 90,000 - (476\u00d73)=90,000 -1,428=88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the layers went up to Layer 9, which was 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me confirm the layers again because I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4. Then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). Let me recount how many layers there are. Each time, the expression is 1+3(...). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*(Layer1)=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*(13)=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nSo, Layer9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88,572, which seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer1:1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer9 is 29,524, and 3 times that is 88,572. Therefore, the solution is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), which means 9 layers. So, from Layer1 to Layer9, each one computed correctly. So yes, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could recognize that this is a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, and so on. This recurrence relation can be solved, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, the general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1, a_1= (3^1 -1)/2= (3-1)/2=1, but wait, our a_1 is 4, so maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = 2*3^{n} - 2. Let's test that. For n=1: 2*3^1 -2=6-2=4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: 2*9 -2=18-2=16, but our a_2 is 13. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, let's try to find the general formula. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 K -3K=1 \u21d2 -2K=1 \u21d2 K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u21d2 4 =3C -1/2 \u21d2 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. So yes, the formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, for Layer9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. 3^10=59049, so a_9=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f.

By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this up to the ninth layer gives us 29,524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8.

Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Finally, 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2, but since there are no more digits, write down 27. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it easier. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize that this is a geometric series. Let me think about it. Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me compute each layer again, but this time using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=13, correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=40, correct. n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=121, correct. n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=364, correct. n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=1093, correct. n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=3280, correct. n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=9841, correct. n=9: (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we compute the 9th layer as 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me check that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I calculated earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280.

Therefore, the solution is 88572. Alternatively, I can express this using the formula. Since the outermost layer is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, using the formula, I get the same answer, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Now, add that to the 60000: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go back to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 is indeed 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that more carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier by breaking it into 9524 instead of 9000, 500, 24. Let me correct that. So, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524=88572.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since the expression is finite with 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me time. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula also gives the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.

Wait, no, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So let me write it down:\n\n  29524\n*     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let's write it step by step:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding 59048 + 20000 = 79048\n\n79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a step. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Is that correct? Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572 is the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, multiplying by 3 at the end gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, which might save time if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. The expression is a geometric series or something similar?\n\nWait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without computing each layer, which is more efficient, especially if there were more layers.\n\nBut since I only had nine layers, doing it step by step was manageable. However, knowing the formula is helpful for future problems.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added 1 each time. But the formula I derived seems to fit.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, and 3 * 4 = 12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So adding up the products: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check my multiplication again. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, but let me check the layers again because 29524 seems a bit high for Layer 9, which would make the final answer 88572. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So reading the digits from bottom to top: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the value efficiently. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I should just do 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit from right to left:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nWait, but 29524 has only 5 digits, so I think I made a mistake in the number of digits. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2, 9, 5, 2, 4.\n\nSo, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nNow, since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 would be written as 2, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4, so when I multiply by 3, I should get:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Let me verify with another method: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048.\n\n79048 + 9524: 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that checks out. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me double-check my earlier computations because I might have made a mistake in calculating the layers.\n\nLet me go back step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9841*3.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3.\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2.\n\nSince there are no more digits, write 2.\n\nWait, that would make 9841*3=29523, which is correct. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. That's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's nine sets of (1+3(...)), so that's nine layers. I computed up to Layer 9, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, step-by-step seems manageable.\n\nWait, another approach: Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is (3^{n} - 1)/2, but I think the approach I took is solid.\n\nWait, but let me double-check 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Yes, because 3^5=243, 3^10=(3^5)^2=243^2=59049.\n\nSo, yes, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by using the recurrence relation formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost layer by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach confirms the result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ". Then, 3 * 9000 = 27000. 3 * 500 = 1500. 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let's do that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way.
