    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, no, that's breaking it down incorrectly. Let me do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out vertically:\n\n   29524\nx      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me go back and make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, I think I did it correctly. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that applies here. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which is a recursive structure. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result would be 3*a_9.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but given the nested structure, the recursive approach seems more straightforward.\n\nJust to recap, here's the step-by-step computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that all checks out. I don't think I made any calculation errors this time, especially since the closed-form solution confirmed the result. So, I'm pretty confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the previous layer into the next one. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

When I started, I thought there were nine layers, but when I counted the parentheses, I might have miscounted. Let me check the original expression again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses: each \"(\", so that's nine layers. So, I think I did it right, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it in a different way to verify. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined by the previous term. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step as I did before, and since I got 88572, I think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer again just to be sure.

Yep, that's correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88,572. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we calculated earlier. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n + 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. We have a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the original expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. I think this confirms that the answer is correct. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested parentheses from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, let's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we have 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Wait, but that seems off because 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me check with another method: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 2 = 59048, plus 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, so the total expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, is that the final answer? Hmm, but let me double-check my computations because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps. Let me go back through each layer and verify:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nWait, when I count the opening parentheses, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let me count them:\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is Layer 1: 1+3\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nSo, yes, nine layers. So, computing up to Layer9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer, perhaps this is a geometric series or follows a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, the ninth layer is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10}, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSame result again.\n\nSo, whether I compute step by step, use the recurrence relation, or express it in terms of exponents, I end up with the same final answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 +72=88572. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13. Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. This looks like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer, where L_1 = 1 +3, L_2 =1 +3*L1, and so on up to L9. Then, the total expression is 3*L9. So, let's see if there's a pattern or a formula for L_k. Let's compute the first few layers:\n\nL1 = 4\nL2 =1 +3*4=13\nL3=1 +3*13=40\nL4=1 +3*40=121\nL5=1 +3*121=364\nL6=1 +3*364=1093\nL7=1 +3*1093=3280\nL8=1 +3*3280=9841\nL9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nHmm, let me see if I can find a pattern in the coefficients. Let's list L1 to L9:\n\nL1: 4\nL2:13\nL3:40\nL4:121\nL5:364\nL6:1093\nL7:3280\nL8:9841\nL9:29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each L_k is 3*L_{k-1} +1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_k = 3*L_{k-1} +1, with L1=4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_k^(h) = C*3^k.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_k^(p) = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D +1 => D -3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_k = (3/2)*3^k -1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with L1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nL2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nL3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nSo, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. But wait, just to make sure, let me verify 3*29524 once again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524*3= (30000 - 476)*3=90000 - 1428=90000-1428=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, all my computations seem consistent.

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I did earlier. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The formula for a_n in this case would be a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see: For n=1, a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4, so that formula doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the formula is a_n = (3^{n} + 1)/2. Let's test that: For n=1, (3^1 + 1)/2 = (3 +1)/2 = 2, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a_n = 3^{n} - 2. Let's test: n=1: 3^1 -2 = 1, which is not 4. n=2: 9 -2=7, which is not 13. Not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = 3^{n} + 1. n=1: 3 +1=4, which matches a_1=4. n=2: 9 +1=10, which doesn't match a_2=13. Hmm, not quite. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = 3^{n} + something. Let's see the values: a_1=4=3+1, a_2=13=9+4, a_3=40=27+13, a_4=121=81+40, etc. It seems that each a_n is 3^{n} + a_{n-1}, but that's just the recurrence relation itself. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula. Let me consider the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods\u2014computing step by step and using the closed-form formula\u2014gave the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is calculated step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, a closed-form formula is derived to compute the final value efficiently. The result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function, I think. Let me try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Hmm, I can see that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. That makes me confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following the formula a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a geometric series. The sum of such a series can be expressed as (3^{n} - 1)/2, which is exactly what I derived. Therefore, using the formula is a more efficient way to compute the value without having to calculate each layer individually. Either way, the result is the same. So, I think I've solved the problem correctly. The final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, in case I made a mistake in the computations. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to express it recursively. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1: a_1=4. n=2: a_2=1 +3*4=13. n=3: a_3=1 +3*13=40. Yep, same as before. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let's suppose that the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, n=9: a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 1, each step is 1 + 3*previous. This is similar to a geometric progression but with a twist because of the +1 each time. But using the formula for the linear recurrence seems more efficient. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form formula to compute the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Find the closed-form formula**: Solving the recurrence relation, we find \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute the innermost layer**: For \\( n = 9 \\), \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's see, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. So, that's correct. Wait, but the original problem was 3*(...), which is 3 times Layer 9, which we computed as 29524, so 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something. Let me see, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, that can be written as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches L_1=4. Good. Let's test n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2=13. Good. Similarly, n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is Layer 3=40. Correct. So, this formula works. So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524)=88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3, it's more of a nested multiplication. But the recurrence relation approach worked well, so I think that's the way to go. So, to recap: Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1=4. Using the recurrence relation, we found that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. So, that's how I arrived at the solution. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for these nested expressions. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation.

The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, L_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4.

So, 3*29524 = 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9524. So 3*20000=60000, and 3*9524=28572, so adding them together: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. So, the total would be 88,572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering how each layer is tripling and adding 1, it might make sense. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, it seems like each step checks out. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern. Let me see: Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct.

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, 3 * 4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, yes. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, that's right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, right. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, yes. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, yes. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of the innermost layer a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572, as before. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Correct. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, the step-by-step process is: 1. Recognize the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost outwards. 2. Use the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} starting from a_1=4. 3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation. 4. Compute the innermost layer, then proceed outward, multiplying by 3 at the end. 5. Verify each step to ensure accuracy. So, yeah, I think that's how it's done. It was a bit tedious with all the layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I didn't make any calculation errors that I can see, and the formula confirmed the result, so I feel confident.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer results in 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Then, 3 * 9000 = 27000, but wait, 29524 is 29000 + 524. So, 3 * 29000 = 87000. Then, 3 * 524 = 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back step by step to ensure each layer was computed correctly. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because the numbers get large quickly. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can simplify this without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's verify this with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods give the same result, which makes me confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but since I already have a formula, I think this is sufficient. So, to recap, by computing each layer step by step and then verifying with a recurrence relation, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers.

Write down 7, carryover 2.\nFinally, the leftmost digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me recount the digits:\n\n29524 has digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n5 * 3 =15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n9 * 3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n2 *3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\nNow, since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 would make it 28, but wait, that's not right because we've already processed all digits. Wait, actually, after processing the 2 (ten thousands place), we're done. So, the result should be 88572. Wait, let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7.\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2.\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928.\nSo, writing them together: 8 (from 2*3+2), 8 (from 9*3+1), 5 (from 5*3),7 (from 2*3+1),2 (from 4*3). So the number is 88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when I do multiplication step by step, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Did I compute Layer 9 correctly? Because if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572. But let me check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\nLayer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So Layer9 is indeed 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(Layer9). So, Layer9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. That should be the final answer. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step using my method.\n\nInnermost Layer1:1+3=4\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\nThen, 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, compute directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40=120. Which matches my step-by-step approach. So, my method seems correct.\n\nAnother test: Let's take 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Compute:\n\nInnermost Layer1:1+3=4\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\nThen, 3*13=39.\n\nDirect computation: 3(1 + 3*4)=3(1+12)=3*13=39. Correct.\n\nSo, applying the same method to the original problem, which has nine layers, I get 88572 as the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, that's nine layers. So, starting from Layer1 to Layer9, each computed as above. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of parentheses. By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4.

Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, add that to the 20000 part: 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Wait, no, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9524. So, 3*(20000 + 9524) = 3*20000 + 3*9524 = 60000 + 28572 = 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Actually, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we're doing 1 + 3*(something). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n. Looking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the outermost layer: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014direct computation and using the recurrence relation formula\u2014give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 3*3=9 +2=11.

Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is 88572, but I think I made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me double-check my earlier steps because 29524 seems a bit high. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Hmm, so that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572. Wait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...), and we have 9 layers. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are growing rapidly, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. Let me try computing Layer 9 again: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I could notice that each layer is following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's see how many layers we have. The innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, and the outermost is Layer 9, so n=9. So, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I double-checked using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation method, and both gave me the same result.

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, and 3 * 4 = 12. Adding those together: 27000 + 1500 = 28500; 28500 + 60 = 28560; 28560 + 12 = 28572. Wait, no, that's not right because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a miscalculation. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; so 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. As before, let's compute that carefully: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down digit by digit: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit surprised by how large the number is. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression inside seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which might save time instead of computing each layer. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find D. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524. Therefore, the final answer is 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that the answer is correct now. So, the step-by-step computation, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, gives the final answer as 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. So adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute it again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000; 9000 * 3 = 27000; 500 * 3 = 1500; 24 * 3 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from right to left:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the digits are:\n\nPosition: 5 4 3 2 1\nDigits:    2 9 5 2 4\n\nWait, no, actually, when writing 29524, it's 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place): 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place): 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit (ten thousands place): 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572. So that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps using a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution for the non-homogeneous part. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n = 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step computation and a more general approach using recurrence relations, which helped confirm that my initial computation was correct.

So, 3 * 9524 = 28572. Now, add that to the earlier 27000? Wait, no, that's already included. Wait, no, I think I made a miscalculation. Let me try again. 3 * 29524: Break it down as 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I had 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in computation. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, the outermost layer is 3*29524. As I calculated earlier, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. Wait, that's getting confusing. Maybe a better way is to add 29524 three times. 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000=79048, +9524=79048+9000=88048, +524=88048+500=88548, +24=88572. So, yes, that confirms that 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). But when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. However, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check the number of layers again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count them: 1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). How many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1+3(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1+3(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1+3(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1+3(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1+3(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1+3(Layer 8)\nLayer 10: 1+3(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but the original expression only has nine layers. Let me recount. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" before the closing parentheses start. Let's write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n   - The first \"1+3(\" is Layer 1\n   - Then another \"1+3(\" is Layer 2\n   - Continuing until Layer 9, because after the ninth \"1+3(\", we start closing parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, when I count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences, it's 9. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nSo, in total, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). Therefore, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, ending at Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, I think my answer is correct. However, just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the layers again, step by step, to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, multiply Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ", 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 20 = 60, and 3 * 4 = 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b/(a-1)). So, L_n = C*3^n + 1/(3-1) = C*3^n + 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 + 1/2 = 3C + 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2. Therefore, C = (7/2)/3 = 7/6. Thus, the general formula is L_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. Simplifying, (7/6)*3^n = 7*(3^n)/6. Let me compute L_9 using this formula. L_9 = 7*(3^9)/6 + 1/2. First, compute 3^9. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, L_9 = 7*19683/6 + 1/2. Compute 7*19683: 19683*7. Let's compute that: 19683*7: 10000*7=70000, 9000*7=63000, 600*7=4200, 80*7=560, 3*7=21. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 19683 is 19,683. So, 19,683 *7: Let me compute step by step. 19,683 *7: 10,000*7=70,000; 9,000*7=63,000; 600*7=4,200; 80*7=560; 3*7=21. Now, add them up: 70,000 + 63,000 = 133,000; 133,000 + 4,200 = 137,200; 137,200 + 560 = 137,760; 137,760 + 21 = 137,781. So, 7*19,683 = 137,781. Now, L_9 = 137,781 /6 + 1/2. Let's compute 137,781 divided by 6. 6*22,963=137,778 (since 22,963*6=137,778). So, 137,781 - 137,778 = 3. So, 137,781 /6 = 22,963 + 3/6 = 22,963.5. Then, add 1/2: 22,963.5 + 0.5 = 22,964. So, L_9 = 22,964. Wait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I got L_9 as 29,524. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, that means I must have made a mistake in my general formula approach. Let me check where I went wrong. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is indeed L_n = C*3^n + (1)/(3-1) = C*3^n + 1/2. Then, applying L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3 + 1/2 => 3C = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2 => C = 7/(2*3) = 7/6. So, L_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. So, L_9 = (7/6)*3^9 + 1/2. 3^9 is 19,683. So, (7/6)*19,683 = 7*(19,683/6). 19,683 divided by 6 is 3,280.5. Then, 7*3,280.5 = 22,963.5. Adding 1/2 gives 22,963.5 + 0.5 = 22,964. But earlier, by step-by-step computation, I got L_9 as 29,524. There's a conflict here. That means I must have made a mistake in either the general formula approach or in the step-by-step computation. Let me re-examine the step-by-step computation. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. So, the step-by-step computation seems correct, giving L_9 =29,524. But the general formula gave me L_9=22,964. That's a problem. Where did I go wrong? Let me check the general formula again. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, that's different from what I had before. So, I think I made a mistake earlier in the particular solution. Let me redo it properly. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1. So, it's of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The general solution is L_n = C*a^n + (b)/(a-1). So, L_n = C*3^n + 1/(3-1) = C*3^n + 1/2. Now, applying L_1=4: 4 = C*3 + 1/2 => 3C = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2 => C=7/(2*3)=7/6. So, L_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. Wait, but when n=1, L_1= (7/6)*3 +1/2= (7/6)*3=7/2 +1/2=8/2=4, which is correct. For n=2, L_2=(7/6)*9 +1/2= (63/6) + 3/6=66/6=11. But earlier, by step-by-step, L_2=13. That's a discrepancy. So, clearly, the general formula is not matching the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in setting up the general formula. Wait, perhaps the initial condition is at n=1, but the general formula assumes n starts at 0. Let me check that. If n=0, L_0 would be? Let me see. If I set n=0, then L_0 = (7/6)*3^0 +1/2=7/6 +1/2=7/6 +3/6=10/6=5/3\u22481.666..., but that doesn't make sense because L_1 is 4. So, perhaps the general formula is correct, but I'm misapplying it. Alternatively, maybe the recurrence is 1-based, so n starts at 1. Let me try computing L_1 using the formula: L_1=(7/6)*3^1 +1/2=7/6*3 +1/2=7/2 +1/2=8/2=4. Correct. L_2=(7/6)*9 +1/2=63/6 +3/6=66/6=11. But according to step-by-step, L_2=13. So, the formula is giving 11, but step-by-step says 13. Therefore, there's a mistake in the general formula approach. Let me try another method. Let me list out the values of L_n from n=1 to n=9 using the step-by-step method and see if I can spot a pattern or perhaps find where the formula went wrong. n | L_n\n1 | 4\n2 | 13\n3 | 40\n4 | 121\n5 | 364\n6 | 1093\n7 | 3280\n8 | 9841\n9 | 29524\n\nNow, let's see if these numbers match any known sequence or if there's a formula that can represent them. Alternatively, perhaps I can express L_n as (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test that. For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the correct formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, my earlier mistake was in setting up the general solution. The correct particular solution should have been L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, when n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048; 59048/2=29524. That matches the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the earlier approach where I thought the general solution was (7/6)*3^n +1/2 was incorrect. The correct general solution is L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, that explains why when I used the general formula earlier, I got a different result. I must have made a mistake in finding the particular solution. Therefore, the correct way is to recognize that L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, now, knowing that, let's compute the original expression. The original expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Therefore, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, since L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern in the layers.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's easier to do 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.

Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7.\n5 \u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n9\u00d73=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n9\u00d73=27, write 7, carryover 2.\nBut wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me count: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

Let me go back.\n\nI computed Layer 1 as 1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2:1+3\u00d74=13.\n\nLayer3:1+3\u00d713=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3\u00d740=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3\u00d7121=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3\u00d7364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3\u00d71093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3\u00d73280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3\u00d79841=29524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" starts a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting with the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, Layer1 to Layer9, each computed correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final computation is 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nI think that's correct. To be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nAlternatively, noticing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven a_1=4, and the recurrence a_n =1 +3a_{n-1}.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n =1 +3a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n =3a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K =1 +3K \u2192 K -3K=1 \u2192 -2K=1 \u2192 K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C -1/2 \u2192 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series, but I think the recurrence relation method is more straightforward here.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying using a recurrence relation approach, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous value. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is 88572. But let me verify that: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my layers because that seems like a lot of layers, and I might have miscounted. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, we add another layer. How many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds one more. The expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each adding a layer. Wait, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first parenthesis after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n2. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) \n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) \n8. (1+3(1+3)) \n9. (1+3)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each one more than the previous. So, Layer 1 is the innermost (1+3), and Layer 9 is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. So, in my earlier computation, I correctly calculated up to Layer 9, which was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, but let me verify my calculations for each layer because that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Now, multiplying by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*29524 manually to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That checks out.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers, maybe I can try a different approach. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Therefore, the result is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find D, set a_n = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outer expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, when expanded, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nIf I expand it, it would be 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3^9, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think.\n\nActually, each layer contributes a term multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=10, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check.\n\nWait, from the closed-form solution, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it: the expression simplifies to (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is 88572.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step and then applying the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation, we find the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are 9 layers before the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Outer Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation**:\n   - The recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 leads to a closed-form solution a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n   - For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n   - Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, just to confirm. Let's see, each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is known. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula and confirm. For n=1 to 9: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = 4, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=13, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=40, a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=121, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=364, a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=1093, a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=3280, a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=9841, a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=29524. Yep, all match my previous calculations. So, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. I feel confident about this now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value using the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers of 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times '1+3(' appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another '1+3(' until the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first '(', each '1+3(' adds another layer. Let's count the number of '1+3(' sequences: Starting after the initial 3(, we have '1+3(', then another '1+3(', and so on, until the innermost '1+3'. Let me count the number of '1+3(' instances. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first '(', each '1+3(' is a new layer. Let's count the number of '1+3(' after the initial 3(...). Each '1+3(' adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each step adds another '1+3('. Let me count the number of '1+3(' after the initial 3(...). It's: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of '1+3(' after the initial 3 is 9. Wait, no. Let me count the number of '1+3(' sequences. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another '1+3('. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of '1+3(' after the initial 3. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each '1+3(' is a new layer. So, the number of layers is 9. Wait, but in the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another '1+3('. So, the total number of layers is 9. Therefore, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly, so the final result is 88572. Hmm, but I feel like this might not be correct because when I compute each layer, I'm getting larger numbers each time, which makes sense, but maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me double-check each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer is correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I multiplied correctly. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that works. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct. So, I think I've done this correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when I break it down, I might make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

Yep, same result. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers, let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, I think that's solid. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me check. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers. Wait, let me see: Starting from the innermost as Layer 1, and going out to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, if I had to compute this for any number of layers, say k layers, the result would be 3*(3^{k+1} - 1)/2. But in this case, k=9, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me check that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or use the closed-form expression, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Wait, 3*364 is 1092, correct. So 1 + 1092 is 1093. Correct.) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them again. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time adding another layer. So the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost. So when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the innermost part of the entire expression, and then I multiplied by 3. So that should be correct. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or something, but since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive relation. Let me think about that. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a geometric progression and used the formula directly, but since I already computed each layer step by step and verified with the recurrence relation, I think that's thorough enough. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just check the multiplication one more time. 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 3*3=9 +2=11.

Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct).

Hmm, that seems correct, but I feel like that's a very large number. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly.

Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3. Then each time, we have another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1 + 3 appear? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...). Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(1+3(...), each time there's another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? Let's count the number of 1+3 sections. From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3. So, from the innermost, how many? Let me see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3. Then each layer adds another 1+3. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears, which is 9 times. Wait, because the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3(Layer1). Up to Layer 9: 1+3(Layer8). Then the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers. So, my computation from Layer1 to Layer9 is correct, and then the final result is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. That seems correct, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my method is correct. Let's say we have 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). So, three layers. Let me compute that step by step. Innermost: Layer1:1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Then the outermost is 3*40=120. Alternatively, computing directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. Now, let me compute it using my method. Layer1:1+3=4. Layer2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Then 3*40=120. Correct. So, my method works for a smaller case. Therefore, applying the same method to the original problem should give the correct result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Let me check my calculations again because 3 * 29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, that seems too convoluted. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that's what I got before, but let me confirm:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n24 \u00d7 3 = 72 \u2192 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, so 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572. So the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer because if I made a mistake in one of the layers, the entire answer would be off. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7previous layer, perhaps it's a geometric series or follows a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. On the other hand, using the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 \u2192 6A = 9 \u2192 A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, plug A = 3/2 into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 \u2192 9/2 + B = 4 \u2192 B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that can't be right because 3*29524 is actually 88572. Let me check that again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24, right? So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are growing so quickly. Let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication at any step. Let me try computing Layer 9 again: 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems quite large. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check with a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n, starting from L_1 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm 3^10 is indeed 59049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

So, the recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. That's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. But just to make sure, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 29524 is Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. If I expand this, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand it step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, same result. So, I think I can be confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check once more with another approach. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, starting from L1=4, each subsequent term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, the general formula for such a recurrence is Ln = a*r^(n) + b, where a and b are constants. Let me try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1, which has the solution Ln = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, L1 should be 4.\n\nPlugging n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9.\n\nSo, Layer 9: L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression without using the formula, it would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nExpanding step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 =13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40=121.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*121=364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, same result each time.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 =7.\n\n5 *3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down7, carry over2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as:\n\n29524 *3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12=60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+60=88560+12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after all these checks, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4.

Let's compute 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. 0*3=0 +2=2. 2*3=6. So the number is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then 79048 + 9524 = 79048 + 9000 = 88048, then +524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out correctly. So, I think that's the right answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time helps prevent mistakes. I was worried I might have missed a layer or miscalculated somewhere, but going through each step carefully seems to have worked. I guess the key here was to recognize the nested structure and compute each layer starting from the innermost one, then building up to the outermost. It's like peeling an onion; each layer reveals the next one, and you just need to be patient and methodical. Another way to think about this might be to recognize a pattern or formula that could simplify the computation, but given that each layer depends on the previous one, it's probably necessary to compute each step manually. Alternatively, maybe there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for such nested expressions, but I'm not sure. For now, computing each layer step by step seems to have worked fine. Just to be thorough, let me try to see if there's a pattern in the numbers I got for each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, each is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, each term is 3n +1 where n is the previous term. That seems consistent. For example, 4 = 1 + 3*1, but wait, no, actually, the first term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous). So, yes, each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). But in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, starting from a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me confirm: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f, etc. So, using the formula for such a recurrence, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final computation is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gave me the same result as computing each layer step by step. That\u2019s reassuring. It also shows that recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation can save time, especially if the number of layers is large. But for just nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. I think this solidifies my confidence in the answer. So, to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Alternatively, model the problem as a recurrence relation and solve it using the formula for linear recurrences.\n3. Both methods lead to the same result, confirming the correctness.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n- \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers.

Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 more carefully.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that's 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I did it earlier, I thought it was 88,572, but I wrote 88572, which is the same as 88,572.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a specific recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.

    "text": ". 3 * 9000 = 27000. 3 * 500 = 1500. 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, maybe that's too broken down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572.

Okay, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, etc., which is exactly what I did. So, computing each a_n up to a_9 and then multiplying by 3 gives the result. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see:\n\na1 = 4\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at the numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524\n\nI notice that each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with a1:\n\na1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\na2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\na3 = (3^4 -1)/2 =81 -1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na4 = (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations when I was computing each layer manually, let me go through each step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, all these steps check out. So, the final computation is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.
