    "text": " 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me double-check my earlier layers because if any of those layers were miscalculated, the final answer will be off. Let's go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which we computed as 88572. Let me confirm that 29524*3 is indeed 88572. Let me compute it another way: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait a minute, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3... parts. Starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses after each 1 + 3. Let's parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nStarting from the left: The first 3 is outside the first parenthesis. Then, inside, it's 1 + 3(...). That's the first layer. Then, inside that, another 1 + 3(...). So each time, we have a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nFrom the innermost: The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So how many layers? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3: that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outwards, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer. So the next one is Layer 2, then Layer 3, up to Layer 9, because each time we have another 1 + 3(...). So in total, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Therefore, my earlier calculation of 9 layers is correct, with Layer 9 being the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3. Therefore, my computation of 29524 as Layer 9 and then multiplying by 3 to get 88572 seems accurate. However, just to be absolutely certain, let me compute each layer again, step by step, to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me add 29524 three times to verify:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by breaking down the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, each layer is correctly computed, and the multiplication at the end also seems accurate. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the right answer. To double-check, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could have helped me compute this without doing each layer manually. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0, but in this case, a_1 is 4, so maybe the formula would be slightly different. Alternatively, since each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. Let me see if there's a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to go through each layer step by step, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for this problem, since it's only 9 layers, both methods work. I think I've thoroughly checked my work and the answer seems consistent. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize that each layer follows the pattern $a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}$, starting from the innermost layer. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the pattern:** Each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}$.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the innermost:**\n   - Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n   - Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n   - Layer 3: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n   - Layer 4: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n   - Layer 5: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$\n   - Layer 6: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$\n   - Layer 7: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$\n   - Layer 8: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$\n   - Layer 9: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually as I did before is manageable. Alternatively, the closed-form formula for such a recurrence would be L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me test it for n=1: L_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but L_1 is actually 4. So that formula doesn't fit. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps L_n = 2*3^{n} - 1. Let's test for n=1: 2*3^1 -1 = 6 -1 =5, which is not 4. Hmm, maybe another approach. Let me try to find the pattern in the L_n values I computed earlier: L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that connects n to L_n. Let's see: For L1=4, which is 1 + 3 =4.\n\nWait, but maybe each L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1. Let's check:\n\nL1=4.\n\nL2=3*4 +1=13, which matches.\n\nL3=3*13 +1=40, correct.\n\nL4=3*40 +1=121, correct.\n\nYes, so the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L1=4.\n\nNow, solving this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum involving powers of 3. Let me see.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me expand the entire expression. Let's denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nI can see that each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*something). So, if I expand E, it's 3*1 + 3^2*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) and so on. But that might get too complicated. Alternatively, since I've already found that each layer L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is L9, then E = 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, E = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to get the same result, confirming that the answer is 88572.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).

Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. Wait, actually, it's a finite geometric series, but let me see. Let me define the expression recursively. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can compute each a_n step by step up to a_9, then multiply by 3. Wait, but in our earlier computation, a_9 was 29524, and then 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a geometric progression, but since each term is defined based on the previous one, the formula approach is more straightforward. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next layer.

Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do this step by step. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As before, that's 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + a(a + a(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recursive formula. Let me think if that's applicable here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4, which is L_1. Then Layer 2 is L_2, and so on up to Layer 9, which is L_9. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both methods gave me the same result, and I double-checked each step. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allowed me to find a formula, which made the computation much faster instead of calculating each layer step by step. But either way, the answer is consistent. So, yeah, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Let me check if I can find another way to compute this, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence. Let me write down the terms:\n\na1 = 4\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I could model this as a geometric series, but since each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it that way to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a geometric progression or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3, but with an added constant each time. But since I've already found a closed-form formula and verified it, I think that's sufficient. So, to recap: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... ))) Each layer can be computed using L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.

Sometimes, these can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let's denote the layers as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, etc., up to L9. Then, the total expression is 3*L9. Now, let's see if we can find a pattern or a formula for Ln. Let's see:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, starting from L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve the recurrence relation:\n\nGiven Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4.\n\nWe can write the homogeneous solution as Ln^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume Ln^p = D, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4.

Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer because that seems like a lot, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure.

Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it that way. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using this formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is (3^{10}-1)/2. Therefore, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms it. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Sometimes, when doing multiple layers, it's easy to have an off-by-one error or a miscalculation. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that I can recognize here to compute it more efficiently, rather than computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9000 = 88048; 88048 + 524 = 88572. Same result. So, everything checks out.

Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Each step seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on, up to L9. This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's test this. Suppose L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B = -1/2. So, L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, since each layer is a geometric series, maybe I can think of it as such. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous). This can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to express L9 as a sum. Let's see: L1 = 1 + 3\nL2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\nL3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\nL9 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...9 times...)))\n\nSo, expanding L9, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Wait, because each layer adds another power of 3. Let me check: L1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\nL2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*1 + 3*3 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\nL3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*1 + 3*3 + 3*9 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}. Therefore, L9 would be the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, n=9 terms (from 3^0 to 3^8). So, S = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2=9841. Wait, but earlier, I had L9 as 29524, which was (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps my indexing is off. Let me check again. If L1 corresponds to n=1, which is 1 + 3^1, so that's two terms. Then, L2 is 1 + 3 + 9, which is three terms. So, L_n has n+1 terms. Therefore, L9 would have 10 terms, from 3^0 up to 3^9. Wait, no, let me see: L1: 1 + 3^1 = 2 terms (3^0 + 3^1)\nL2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 3 terms (3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2)\nL3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 4 terms (3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3)\nSo, L_n has (n+1) terms, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n. Therefore, L9 would have 10 terms, from 3^0 to 3^9. So, the sum is (3^{10} -1)/(3 -1) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier result. So, L9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked using both the recursive method and the geometric series formula, and both led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of Layer n. Then, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n}*(L_1 - b/(a-1)) + b/(a-1). Let me recall the formula. For a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n-1} * L_1 + (b/(a-1))*(a^{n-1} - 1). Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*a^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). So, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + b/(1 - a). Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*a^1 + b/(1 - a) => C*a + b/(1 - a) = 4. Plugging in a=3 and b=1: C*3 + 1/(1 - 3) = 4 => 3C + 1/(-2) = 4 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer. Since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = (177144)/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap: The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine layers inside the first 3*. So, starting from the innermost layer, each layer can be computed step by step, or using the formula for the linear recurrence. Both methods lead to the same result.

Let me check my earlier computations because 88572 seems high. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.

Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression because computing each layer manually might be time-consuming, especially if the number of layers increases. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for L_9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, adding 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6 +1=7, 5*3=15, 9*3=27 +1=28, 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think: The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose I have a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, defined as f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, f(1) = 4, f(2) = 13, f(3) = 40, etc., which matches what I calculated earlier. Now, solving this recurrence relation: f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). The homogeneous solution is f(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution f_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: f(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: f(3)=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9 layers, f(9)=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*f(n) = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*f(9)= (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, using the formula, I can see that the answer is 88572 without computing each layer step by step. That's a more efficient way, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. Then, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The recurrence relation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically, and the formula for the recurrence relation checks out with the computed layers. So, yeah, 88572 should be the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth term. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. The original expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, that's another way to compute it using the general formula. I think that solidifies the result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the general formula for the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

So, I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but given that each layer is only one step, computing each layer step by step seems manageable and less error-prone than trying to find a formula. Let me see if there's a pattern in the layers to confirm. Looking at the layers: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2:13 Layer 3:40 Layer 4:121 Layer 5:364 Layer 6:1093 Layer 7:3280 Layer 8:9841 Layer 9:29524 Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term is following the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's a geometric sequence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me check if that's the case here. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition: Let's say n=1 corresponds to Layer 1: a_1 =4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, Layer 9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing step by step and using the formula. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, it's 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers I computed. The innermost was Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, Layer3:1+3*13=40, Layer4:1+3*40=121, Layer5:1+3*121=364, Layer6:1+3*364=1093, Layer7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. So that's 9 layers, each computed correctly. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, just to confirm. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, starting with L1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence relation is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for Ln. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution, Ln^p. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L9, n=9: L9=(3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula for L9, which is (3^10 -1)/2, then 3*L9=3*(3^10 -1)/2=(3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*L9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result, which is reassuring.

Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the problem isn't too long, maybe it's faster to compute each layer. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, I could have just computed each layer step by step, as I did initially, and arrived at the same result. So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring. I think that's solid. So, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the inside out, or by recognizing the pattern and using a formula, I arrive at the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but maybe for this problem, since it's only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable. But just to make sure, let me try to see if the numbers I'm getting make sense. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the sequence goes: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, 4*3 +1=13, 13*3 +1=40, 40*3 +1=121, and so on. So, the numbers are growing exponentially, which is why the final result is so large. Let me check if 3*(Layer 9) is indeed 88572. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.

Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct. So, yes, that's consistent.

Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Hmm, but I have a feeling that maybe I missed a layer or something because the original expression has multiple layers, but I counted nine layers. Wait, let me count again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences. From the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see: The first layer is 3*(1+3*(...)). Then inside that, another 1+3*(...), and so on. So, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first 3 is multiplied by (1+3(...)). Then inside that, each time, it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of \"1+3\" terms. Each time, it's 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost: There are 9 instances of 1+3, each nested inside the previous one. So, that would mean 9 layers. So, my initial computation was correct, with 9 layers. So, each layer from 1 to 9, as I did before. Therefore, the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could help verify the result. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. That is, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got when I computed layer 9 manually. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as I found earlier. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.

Let me think about how that might apply here.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple linear relation, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nTherefore, for n = 9, L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{10} is 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the result I obtained earlier by computing each layer step by step. So that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I found before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10}/2 - 1/2) = (3^{11})/2 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (177147)/2 - 3/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nSame result. So, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form expression, which is nice because it avoids computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step by step was manageable, but it's good to know that there's a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the inside out, we found that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon that, leading up to the 9th layer being 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step method and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's solve for C and D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I were to compute this without recognizing the pattern, I would have to compute each layer step by step, as I did initially, which also led me to the same result. So, I think I'm solid here. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014direct computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which might not be a straightforward geometric series, but perhaps it's a recursive sequence. Let me see: Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Let's list out the a_n values we have so far: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 13 a_3 = 40 a_4 = 121 a_5 = 364 a_6 = 1093 a_7 = 3280 a_8 = 9841 a_9 = 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers, I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking down each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be solved using a recurrence relation. The final computation leads to the answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. So, I think I've computed this correctly by expanding each layer step by step. Each time, I just multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1, which is the pattern here. So, each layer is following the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. So, this is a recursive computation, where each term depends on the term before it. It's like a geometric series, but not exactly because each term is 1 + 3 times the previous. Wait, maybe I can think of it as a recurrence relation. Let me see, if I denote a_n as the value of Layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find the closed-form solution. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've solved it correctly by both expanding step by step and by finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations.

Let me recount the layers: The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1: 4.

So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13 L_3 =1 +3*L_2=1 +3*13=40 L_4=1 +3*L_3=1 +3*40=121 L_5=1 +3*L_4=1 +3*121=364 L_6=1 +3*L_5=1 +3*364=1093 L_7=1 +3*L_6=1 +3*1093=3280 L_8=1 +3*L_7=1 +3*3280=9841 L_9=1 +3*L_8=1 +3*9841=29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula. Let's see: Each layer L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) +1 = A*3^n + 3B +1. But L_n is also equal to A*3^n + B, so setting them equal: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B +1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1=4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A -1/2 =4. So, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1= (3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2= (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my previous calculation. So, the total expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I want to express the entire original expression in terms of the formula, since L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result. This seems consistent, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check each layer because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.

Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help verify this result. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this mathematically. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a base case of a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer was a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4=13, a_3=1 +3*13=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. So, this is a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we have. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, the innermost layer was a_1=4, and the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the linear recurrence. So, either by expanding each layer step by step or by using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute this in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this repeats multiple times, it's similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as before. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recursive formula where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for such a nested expression. Let's see, if I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) n times, it's similar to a geometric series. Let me recall the formula for such a nested expression. Suppose I have x = a + b*x, then x = a + b*x. Solving for x: x - b*x = a => x*(1 - b) = a => x = a / (1 - b). But in our case, each layer is x = 1 + 3*x, which would lead to x = 1 + 3x, but that would imply x = -1/2, which doesn't make sense here because we're dealing with positive numbers. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the approach. Alternatively, maybe each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let's define L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for L_k. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^{k} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let's find C. The homogeneous solution is L_k^{(h)} = A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_k^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when k=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For k=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is L9, we have L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, since L9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using exponents.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We need another equation to solve for A and B. Let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) 9A + B = 13 (from n=2) Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Therefore, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Substitute into the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this substitution process for each subsequent layer up to the ninth layer, resulting in 29524.\n4. Multiply this result by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my calculations for each layer because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if there's a formula I can apply here. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. This seems like a nested multiplication that can be represented as a sum of a geometric progression. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Starting from the innermost:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation. To solve this, I can expand it:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2})\n\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this expansion, after n steps:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n}*a_1\n\nWait, but a_1 is 4, so:\n\na_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^{n}*a_1\n\nWait, let me think. The sum 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} is a geometric series with ratio 3 and n terms, so the sum is (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^n - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n * a_1\n\nBut a_1 = 4, so:\n\na_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 4*3^n\n\n= (3^n - 1 + 8*3^n)/2\n\n= (9*3^n - 1)/2\n\nWait, that seems off because when n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\nLet me check with n=1:\n\na_1 = (9*3^1 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. But a_1 is supposed to be 4. So, my approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try again.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is when a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which gives a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, ultimately leading to the final computation. Multiplying the outermost result by 3 gives the solution.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check my layers again because I feel like maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 1. Starting from the first 1+3, each subsequent 1+3 is inside another set. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each next layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of 1+3 inside each other. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each next one adds another 1+3. So, how many 1+3 expressions are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. From the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 terms. Let me parse the expression:\n\nThe expression is 3*(...), where inside is 1 + 3*(...), and each inner ... is another 1 + 3*(...). So, the depth is 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3, then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1), up to layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, in my earlier computation, I correctly computed layer1 to layer9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and then finally multiplied by 3 again. So, layer1: 4, layer2:13, layer3:40, layer4:121, layer5:364, layer6:1093, layer7:3280, layer8:9841, layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. But just to be sure, maybe I can compute a few layers manually and see if the pattern holds. Let's try computing layer1 to layer3 manually. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer is correctly computed. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems to be the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer manually using the formula. For example, layer4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier computation. So, yes, the formula is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.
