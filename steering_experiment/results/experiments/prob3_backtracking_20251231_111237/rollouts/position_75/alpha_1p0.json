    "text": " 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the total would be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 =40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. But wait, let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 +3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1+3(...) adds a layer. Let me count: After the first 3, the first (1+3(...)) is Layer 1, then each additional (1+3(...)) adds another layer. Let me see: The expression inside is 1+3(...), which is 9 layers deep? Wait, let me count the number of 3s after each 1. Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression properly.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that each time we have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...). So, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). Let's see how many times this happens. The innermost part is (1 +3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: (1 +3). Then Layer 2: 3*(1 +3) +1? Wait no, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9? Because from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of 1 +3*(...). Wait, let me count the number of 3s after each 1. Let me write it out:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 +3\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n1 +3*(1 +3)\n\nThen:\n\n1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer, which is 3*(...). So, each time we move out one layer, we add another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost (Layer 1: 1 +3), then Layer 2: 1 +3*(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost expression before the final 3 multiplication. So, in total, there are 9 layers, each being 1 +3*(previous layer). So, computing each layer as I did before, I got Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but when I compute each layer, I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount to make sure. Let's list them:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3 =4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9841*3. Let's compute that:\n\n9841*3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, carry over 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, carry over 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29.\n\nSo, 9841*3=29523. Then, Layer9 is 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524*3 again:\n\n29524\nx   3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer9, I thought it was 29524, but 3*29524 is 88572, which is the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, we have 1 +3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the first 3. It's 9 closing parentheses, which suggests 9 layers. So, yes, 9 layers, each computed as I did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nSo, a1=4\n\na2=1+3*4=13\n\na3=1+3*13=40\n\na4=1+3*40=121\n\na5=1+3*121=364\n\na6=1+3*364=1093\n\na7=1+3*1093=3280\n\na8=1+3*3280=9841\n\na9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K=1 +3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying initial condition a1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the final expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and the calculations seem consistent. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here, like a geometric series or something, but given that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n goes from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >1. So, this is a recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1. The general solution to such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the equation: C = 3*C +1 => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition L_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, so L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, the formula I derived using the recurrence relation is correct, and that gives me confidence that my step-by-step computation was accurate. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Layer 4:1 +3*40=121. Layer 5:1 +3*121=364. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote L_n as Layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same answer.

    "text": " 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. So the final result is 88572. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me define a sequence where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is what I had. Similarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 40, and so on. So, the general formula is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 is a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result without having to compute each layer step by step. That's pretty cool. It might have saved time if I had recognized the pattern earlier, but since I was working through it step by step, it was a good exercise. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series, but with an added constant each time. However, the recurrence relation approach worked well here. So, in summary, by recognizing the recursive structure of the problem and finding a closed-form solution, I was able to compute the value efficiently. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a recursive pattern. By defining each layer and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form solution, which allows us to compute the innermost layers efficiently. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 yields the result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now add them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step was manageable. If it were more layers, perhaps a recursive formula or recognizing a geometric series would be more efficient. But for nine layers, step-by-step computation is feasible. Let me check if I can find a pattern in the layers. Let's list the results of each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, each layer is roughly triple the previous layer plus 1. For example, Layer 2 = 3*4 +1=13. Layer 3=3*13 +1=40. Layer 4=3*40 +1=121, and so on. So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. That seems to hold. So, if I define each layer as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4, then this recurrence relation can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. So, substituting a_n^p = B: B = 3*B +1 => B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, using the closed-form expression, since a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form expression, the result is 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So that should be the final answer. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute this using another method or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. This expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So it's like a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding it all out, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). If I expand this completely, it's 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but wait, let me check. Wait, no, because each term is 1 + 3*(...), so when you expand, it's more complicated. Actually, let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the innermost layer, it's 1 + 3. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Wait, so each layer adds another term of 3^n. So, layer n would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. So, layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2, which is exactly what we found earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3 times that sum. So, 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it both by computing each layer step by step and by using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, and both methods give me the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

But just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let's denote the innermost expression as a variable to see if we can find a recursive formula or a closed-form solution. Let's say that each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence, we can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution comes from the equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since our expression has 9 layers, n = 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, multiplying that by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572.

    "text": " 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier computations because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer and verify the calculations. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive expression, and such expressions can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or other formulas. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9). So, we can compute f(n) recursively as f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), starting from f(1)=4. Let's compute f(n) for n=1 to 9: f(1) = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can solve this using a closed-form formula. Let's see. The recursive relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution f_p(n) = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition f(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: f(3) = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 3^(n+1) directly. For n=9, 3^10 is 59049. So, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Either way, the result is the same. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Therefore, (59049 - 1)/2 is 59048/2 = 29524. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, 3*29524 is 88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, maybe I can compute each layer again just to double-check. Let me go through each layer once more: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's try that. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can also think of this expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me explore that. Each time, we have 1 + 3*(...), which when expanded, would give 1 + 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms or something. Wait, let's see. If we expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try to expand it step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let's denote S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Each layer adds another 3*. If I expand S, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) = 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) = 3 + 9*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). But this seems to get complicated. Alternatively, using the formula we found earlier, since each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. So, S =3*a_9=88572. So, that's another way to see it. Alternatively, if I consider that each layer is a geometric progression, then the total sum can be expressed as a geometric series with ratio 3, but I think the recursive approach was more straightforward here. So, to recap, by computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the innermost value, then built up each subsequent layer, and finally multiplied the outermost layer by 3 to get the final answer. I also verified the result using a recursive formula, which gave the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. The innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems like each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we have.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms our earlier result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Wait, but that's a bit confusing because E is defined in terms of itself. Let me see. If I let E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. But if I think of E as having nine layers, then maybe I can model it as a finite geometric series. Alternatively, maybe not, because each layer is 1 + 3*previous. But since there are a finite number of layers, it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step or use the formula we derived. Since we've already computed it as 88572, and the formula also gives the same result, I'm confident that's the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but let me just verify one more time.\n\nCompute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, if I compute 3*(29524), I can break it down as 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom to top: 8,8,5,7,2.

    "text": " 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each term step by step. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. Applying this formula, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, ultimately leading to the final computation of the entire expression as 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So then 3*29524=88572 is the final answer. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure that I didn't miss a layer. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each time you go out, you add another layer. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost, each time you have a 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 occur? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, adding another 1+3. So, the expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct. So, 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, I think my answer is correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1=1+3=4. Then, each subsequent a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see, for n=1: a1=4, n=2: a2=1+3*4=13, n=3:1+3*13=40, which matches what I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2)= 3A -1/2. So, 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which is correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572, as I computed before. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each layer was 1 + 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I was able to compute each layer step by step and then apply the formula to find the final result. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation also led me to the same answer, so that double-checking confirms that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

So, the final answer is 88,572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me see if this is a geometric series or something similar. Looking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me denote each term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, since the expression has nine layers, each adding another multiplication by 3, it's essentially 3 multiplied by a sum that can be expressed as a geometric series. But in this case, since each term is nested, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward. Either way, both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without doing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, but it's nested, so perhaps it's a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if I can express it as such. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Now, to find a closed-form solution for L_n, we can solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (L_1 - b/(a-1)) * a^{n-1} + b/(a-1). Let me recall the formula: For a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = (L_1 - b/(a-1)) * a^{n-1} + b/(a-1). So, plugging in a=3, b=1, L_1=4, we get L_n = (4 - 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(3-1). Simplifying: 1/(3-1) = 1/2. So, L_n = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (7/2)*3^{0} + 1/2 = (7/2)*1 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (7/2)*3^{1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I calculated L_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, perhaps my formula is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in applying the formula. Let me double-check the formula for the recurrence solution. The standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n} * C + b/(a - 1), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Let me derive it step by step. Starting with L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, matches my earlier calculation. So the formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer, 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same place. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that can be generalized, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so a=3 and b=1. Let me check if that's correct. So, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. Let me see: The original expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds for each layer. Therefore, L9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so using the formula, I can compute L9 directly without computing each layer step by step. That's much faster and reduces the chance of error.\n\nSo, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute 3*29524 another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can efficiently compute the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), which can be broken down into layers where each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation:**\n   - Define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n \u2265 2, with L1 = 4.\n   - Solve the recurrence to find a closed-form expression.\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence:**\n   - The general solution is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n   - For n=9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   - Multiply L9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. Wait, this seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a general formula for Ln. Let's define the recurrence relation as Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier values to see if it works. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L9, which is the 9th layer, would be L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it thoroughly, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me write that down. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but let's check if this formula works with our earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works.

Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that confirms it. So, the final result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer's value by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Use the result to compute the next layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go back step by step to check each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, the sequence is: a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. So, 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B. Assume a_n = B, then substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the innermost layer (n=1), this gives 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, when I compute Layer 1 as the innermost, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost, I multiply by 3, which is the initial 3 outside the entire expression. So that gives 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) for n > 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. Since L(n) is defined for each layer, starting at n=1 as the innermost. So, the outermost layer is n=9, which would correspond to L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2, then 3 * L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 59049 * 3 = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent as well.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula approach. Let me go through it again.\n\nGiven L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nWe found the general solution as L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for 3*L(9):\n\n3*L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using a different approach, such as expanding the expression step by step without using the formula. Let me try that again to confirm.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with all previous calculations. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying using both iterative computation and a general formula approach, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\na_2 =1 +3*a1=1+12=13\n\na_3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40\n\na_4=1 +3*a3=1 +120=121\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r=3, so homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB =1 +3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB -3B =1\n\n-2B=1 => B= -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 =3C -1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 +1/2=3C => 9/2=3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the formula applies correctly here. Since each layer is defined as a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=4, which corresponds to the innermost parentheses. So, for 9 layers, n=9, a9=29524, then the total expression is 3*a9=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see the pattern as a geometric series. Each a_n is 1 +3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as:\n\na_n=1 +3*(1 +3*a_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this, eventually, a_n=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^{n-1} +3^n*a_0\n\nBut wait, in our case, a1=4=1 +3, which is 1 +3^1.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2 is correct, as we derived earlier.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524, then 3*a9=88572.\n\nThus, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value and multiply the final layer by 3 to get the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Final Layer by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that would mean 9 layers? Wait, no, because each layer is inside the previous one. Let me think again. Let's parse the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9, which is the outermost one before the initial 3.\n\nSo, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the layers again because I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 1 + 3(...\n3. 1 + 3(...\n4. 1 + 3(...\n5. 1 + 3(...\n6. 1 + 3(...\n7. 1 + 3(...\n8. 1 + 3(...\n9. 1 + 3(...\n\nWait, actually, the outermost is 3(1 + 3(...)), so that's the first layer, then inside that, another 1 + 3(...), which is the second layer, and so on until the innermost is Layer 9. So yes, 9 layers. So my initial computation is correct. So each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I should compute each layer again to check for any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me see if I can find a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nIn general, for an expression of the form:\n\na_n = 1 + k*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence when a_1 = 1 + k is a geometric series.\n\nIn our case, k = 3, and the number of layers is 9. So, starting from a_1 = 4 (as we computed earlier), each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute a few terms using the formula:\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But wait, in our case, a_1 is 4. Hmm, perhaps my initial conditions are different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust the formula.\n\nLet me consider the general solution for the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, which matches our a_1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, which matches our a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work, so I'm pretty sure the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer and recognizing the pattern as a geometric progression, we find that the final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the earlier layers:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, the innermost layer L_1=4, and each subsequent layer up to L_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern in the numbers. Let me see the values again:\n\nLayer 1:4\n\nLayer 2:13\n\nLayer 3:40\n\nLayer 4:121\n\nLayer 5:364\n\nLayer 6:1093\n\nLayer 7:3280\n\nLayer 8:9841\n\nLayer 9:29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, each is roughly 3 times the previous plus 1. So, 4*3=12 +1=13, 13*3=39 +1=40, etc., which matches. Also, the formula L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 gives the same results, so that's consistent. Therefore, I think my answer is correct. Another way to think about it is that each layer is building up a geometric series. The expression can be expanded as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But since it's finite (nine layers), it's a finite geometric series. The formula for the sum of a finite geometric series is S = a*(r^n -1)/(r -1), where a is the first term, r is the ratio, and n is the number of terms. Wait, but in our case, it's a bit different because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, so maybe it's not exactly a geometric series. However, the recurrence relation approach worked well, so perhaps that's the better way to model it. Anyway, I think I've double-checked it enough, and I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed using the formula \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\). This recurrence relation leads to the general solution \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a geometric series or something. Let me see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, so each term is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. That's a recurrence relation. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer adds a 3 multiplied by the next layer. So, when I expand it, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand it all the way, how many terms would I have? Let me see. Each time I expand a layer, I multiply by 3 and add 1. So, the total number of terms is 9 levels deep, each contributing a 3^k term. Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to express the entire expression as a sum. Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, when I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be written as 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 3^9*1, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me try to see. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) where there are 9 layers. Let me try to express E in terms of itself, but I think that might not be straightforward because each layer is only one step. Alternatively, since I have a formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. So that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, and then verifying it again. All methods led me to the same result, so I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\).

Wait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which propagates outward. Let me go back through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3.

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Each time we have 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let's count the number of (1+3(...)): Let's see, starting from the first (1+3(...)), that's the first layer. Each subsequent (1+3(...) adds another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let me write them out:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3(1+3))\n3. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5.

Let me count:\n\nAfter the first 3(, the next is (1+3(, then another (1+3(, and so on until the last (1+3). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)): Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first (1+3(...)), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent (1+3(...) adds another layer.

(1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. So when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layer computations. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern or formula for L_n.\n\nGiven that L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, write the recurrence:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nCharacteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is L_h = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1, L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3*(L_9) using the formula:\n\nTotal expression = 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147\n\nThus, Total expression = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572\n\nSame result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the final multiplication: 29524 *3.\n\nCompute 29524 *3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3 =60000\n\n9000 *3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdd them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 *3:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nPerfect, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the result using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So I think that's correct. Let me just check once more to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to see if there's a shortcut instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Starting from Layer 1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me write down the general form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve it as a non-homogeneous recurrence. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 =4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as before. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly, both by step-by-step computation and by finding a closed-form formula for the layers.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Now, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check this in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, given that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's check if n=9 gives us the correct a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, a_9 is indeed 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, I'll compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 29524*3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524\nx     3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and use it to compute the next layer, repeating this process until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Let me double-check each layer step by step because the numbers are getting large, and it's easy to make an error. Let me go back through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which we computed as 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Wait, but let me just confirm once more because I'm a bit cautious about such large numbers. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The structure of the expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or follows some recursive formula. Let me consider that. The recurrence relation here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have n=9 for the innermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result again. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked each step, so I don't see any mistakes. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula helped solidify that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So the Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me test this. Suppose L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, plugging into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, 0 = 1 + 2B => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result.

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.

Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: There are nine closing parentheses after the initial 3, so that would mean there are nine layers. Wait, but when I started computing, I went up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.

Therefore, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.

Let me check the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nWait, the homogeneous solution comes from a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nPlugging into the equation: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C - 1/2 = 4 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
