Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, that gives us 88572.

Let me verify using another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that matches.

Hmm, that seems right, but let me confirm each multiplication step to be sure. Let me recompute Layer 9: 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 * 3. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. Wait, that's different from what I had before. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I said Layer 9 was 29524, but now when I compute 3*9841, I get 29523, not 29524. Wait, let me check Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841, that's correct. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. So 3*9841 is 29523, then 1 + 29523 is 29524. So that's correct. So when I compute the entire expression, it's 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way.

    "text": " The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just check my steps to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, yes. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, right. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, yes. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, right. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Comparing this with a_n = A*3^n + B, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute a few layers using the formula to see if it matches. For example, a_1 should be (3^{2}-1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which is correct. a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct. a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula works for the initial layers, so I can trust it for layer 9. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the value efficiently. Applying this formula, we determine the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...). Then each time, there's another (1+3(...). Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Next (1+3(...))\n3. Next\n4. Next\n5. Next\n6. Next\n7. Next\n8. Next\n9. Next\n10.

Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1+3)\n\nLayer2: (1+3*(Layer1))\n\nLayer3: (1+3*(Layer2))\n\n...\n\nEach layer is one more 3*(previous layer). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...), then each subsequent (1+3(...). So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the initial 3 is followed by a (1+3(...), which is Layer1. Then inside that, another (1+3(...), which is Layer2, and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, the first ( is for Layer1.\n\nThen, each time, another ( for each subsequent layer. So, let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Next ( is Layer2\n3. Next ( is Layer3\n4. Next ( is Layer4\n5. Next ( is Layer5\n6. Next ( is Layer6\n7. Next ( is Layer7\n8. Next ( is Layer8\n9. Next ( is Layer9\n10. Next ( is Layer10\n\nWait, so actually, there are 10 layers here, not 9. Because starting from the innermost, which is Layer10: (1+3). Then Layer9: (1+3*(Layer10)), and so on up to Layer1: (1+3*(Layer2)). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer1). So, I think I made a mistake earlier by counting only 9 layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, let's see: The innermost is (1+3). Then each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of (1+3(...) expressions. Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1+3(...), then each subsequent (1+3(...). Let's count the number of (1+3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...\n3. And so on.\n\nLet me count each occurrence:\n\n- The first one is 3(1+3(...), which is Layer1.\n- Then, inside that, (1+3(...), which is Layer2.\n- Then, inside that, another (1+3(...), Layer3.\n- Continuing until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by a (, which is Layer1.\n\nThen, inside that, another (, which is Layer2.\n\nContinuing, each ( adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. After 3, first ( is Layer1.\n\nThen, inside Layer1, we have another (, which is Layer2.\n\nInside Layer2, another (, Layer3.\n\nAnd this continues until Layer9, which is the innermost (1+3).\n\nWait, so starting from the initial 3, the first ( is Layer1, and each subsequent ( adds another layer. So, the total number of layers is 9, because after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...).\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, after the initial 3, there's a (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, inside the first (1+3(...), there's another (1+3(...), and so on, until the innermost (1+3). So, how many times does (1+3 appear?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Inside that, another (1+3(...\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, from the initial 3, the first (1+3 is Layer1, then Layer2, up to Layer9, because there are 9 sets of (1+3 after the initial 3.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, it's 9.\n\nBecause the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: each (1+3(...\n\nSo, that means there are 9 layers, each with their own (1+3(...). So, starting from Layer1 as the innermost (1+3), and Layer9 as the outermost.\n\nWait, but when I started earlier, I thought Layer1 was the innermost, which would be the 9th layer from the outside. So, maybe I should number them differently. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me think of the layers as starting from the innermost as Layer1, then moving outward. So, the innermost expression is (1+3), which is Layer1. Then, the next layer out is (1+3*(Layer1)), which is Layer2. Then, Layer3 is (1+3*(Layer2)), and so on, up to Layer9, which is the outermost (1+3*(Layer8)). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, with that in mind, let's recast the layers:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, perhaps my initial count was correct, with 9 layers, and the final result being 88572.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me write out each layer again, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as follows:\n\n29524 *3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3 = 60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12 = 60000+27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572.\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each layer builds upon the previous one correctly, and the multiplication at the end is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. \n\nStarting with the innermost expression:\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n- Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n- Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n- Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n- Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n- Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n- 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Hmm, that seems pretty big, but considering how many layers there are, each multiplication by 3 and addition of 1 would lead to exponential growth, so it's plausible. Let me just verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So writing it together: 6 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Correct. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's right. It's a big number, but given the structure of the problem, it makes sense.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are nine sets of parentheses. Each set adds a new layer. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, my calculation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is a term of the form 1 + 3*a, where a is the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, it's a geometric progression or something similar. Wait, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + ...))), it's a recursive structure. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let's see.\n\nLet me define each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L_n. Let's see if there's a pattern in the numbers:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 13\n\nL_3 = 40\n\nL_4 = 121\n\nL_5 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBecause 3*(3^{10}) =3^{11}, and 3*1=3.\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88,572.\n\nSo, that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. So, if L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is correct. Then, 3*L_9=88,572. Alternatively, using the formula for the entire expression: (3^{11} -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Both methods give the same result, so that's reassuring.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency.\n\nFor n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=8/2=4.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nYes, all correct. Therefore, the computation seems solid.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is a term in a geometric series. Since each L_n =1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and L_1=4, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution we found earlier is the standard solution for such a recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't know about recurrence relations, I could have just computed each layer step by step, as I did initially, and arrived at the same result. Either way, the answer seems consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. So, I don't think I made any calculation errors, and the method seems sound.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number, starting from the innermost layer. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break that down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer and check the computations.

Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 29524 * 3.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, all the layers check out, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, recognizing a geometric series or a recurrence relation can save time and reduce the chance of errors. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at each layer, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. That's a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for it.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all layers. So, using this formula, the 9th layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches my earlier result. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations, so I think that's the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Recognizing this as a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the value efficiently. Applying this formula, we determine that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, after carefully checking each step, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let's do the multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check with another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by breaking it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, the total is 88572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check one more time because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate. Let me verify each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so that's correct. I think my steps are all accurate. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Let me denote each Layer n as L_n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me try that approach. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: L_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: L_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: L_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula for L_n, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step. It's a bit more advanced, using recurrence relations and closed-form expressions, but it confirms the result I got earlier. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost outwards, we find each layer's value and substitute it into the next until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous result.

So the final answer should be 88572. Let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's find another condition. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, which would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to see this as a sum of a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more of a recursive sequence.\n\nWait, another approach: each time you have 1 + 3*(...), so it's similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, think of the expression as follows:\n\nThe innermost term is 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nSo, the sequence goes: 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nSo, all right, after verifying each step and even finding a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Okay, that's consistent. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final result should be 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, then adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and so on, nine times, and then multiplying the entire thing by 3 again. Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...), and that inner ... repeats eight more times. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after the 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count how many times the pattern (1 + 3(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each time we go out one layer, we add another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's see: Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the first ( is Layer 1, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first 3: The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is Layer 1. Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), which is Layer 2, and so on. Let me count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. Therefore, the innermost is Layer 9, and the outermost is Layer 1. Wait, that might be where I went wrong earlier. If I'm starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9, then Layer 1 is the outermost. So, perhaps I should have started from the innermost as Layer 9, then worked my way out to Layer 1, and then multiplied by the initial 3. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me clarify: The expression is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3), and so on until Layer 9, which is 1 + 3. So, actually, Layer 9 is the innermost, and Layer 1 is the outermost. So, when I computed Layer 1 as 4, that was actually Layer 9. So, I think I might have mislabeled the layers. Let me correct that. Let's redefine the layers correctly. Let me start from the innermost parentheses as Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, the outermost Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...), and that repeats eight more times. So, actually, the innermost is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3, and each layer wraps around that. So, the total number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9. So, my earlier calculation seems correct, leading to 88572. But to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again, step by step, from the innermost to the outermost, and then multiply by 3 at the end. Starting with Layer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. But just to make sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. For example, let's say we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Outermost: 3*13 = 39. Let's compute it directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. Now, using my layer method: Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Then, 3*13=39. So, same result. Good. Let's try another one: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Innermost: 1 + 3=4. Next: 1 + 3*4=13. Next: 1 + 3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Compute directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 +12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 +39)=3*40=120. Correct. So, my method works for smaller cases. Therefore, applying it to the original problem should give the correct result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me check once more. When I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then 3*29524=88572. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. Correct. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572. Wait, but let me think about another approach. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, LHS = A*3^n + B, RHS = A*3^n + 3B +1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B +1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B +1. Then, -2B =1 => B= -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1= A*3^1 + B= 3A + (-1/2)=4. So, 3A -1/2=4 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1=4 up to a_9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9=29524. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula also gives us the same result, which reinforces that 88572 is the correct answer. Therefore, after carefully working through the problem step by step, verifying each layer, and even deriving a closed-form solution to confirm, I'm confident that the result is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So yes, that's 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 + 39=40 (correct). Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 (correct). Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 (correct).

So, the final result should be 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, the layers correspond to a_1, a_2, ..., a_9, where a_9 is the innermost expression, and the entire expression is 3*a_9. Wait, no, actually, in the original problem, the innermost is 1+3, which is a_1=4. Then each layer out is a_2=1+3*a_1, a_3=1+3*a_2, and so on until a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might help. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p =1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, then a_2=13, etc., up to a_9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the result is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer, which is more efficient and less error-prone. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem. By recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form solution. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Solving this recurrence gives \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the innermost layer \\( a_9 \\), we compute \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total would be 88572. Wait, that seems a bit large.

So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers, let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1+3, each additional layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each 1+3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions: There are nine instances of 1+3 before the final closing parenthesis. So, that would mean nine layers. So, Layer 1: innermost, Layer 9: outermost. So, my calculation of nine layers is correct. Therefore, I think my answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, this method also gives the same result, confirming that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's more of a recursive sequence. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form expression, but since the number of layers is finite (nine layers), computing each step manually is straightforward and less error-prone than trying to derive a formula. However, just for my own understanding, let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found by iteration or by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. Let's try to find a closed-form solution. First, the recurrence is non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works! So, the 9th layer is indeed 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is 88,572. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the result is 88572. Hmm, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13, correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572, correct. I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the form of a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))), with nine layers. This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but it's nested, so each term is added to 1 and then multiplied by 3. Alternatively, perhaps this can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to represent this recursively. Let\u2019s denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the expression we're trying to compute is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous plus particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 =4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 = 3A -1/2 =4. Solving for A: 3A =4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, A= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for a_9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this confirms the result. It's interesting that using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression leads to the same result without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step was manageable, but for more layers, the closed-form would be more practical. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might have been another approach. Let me see: Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like building a sum where each term is 3^k, but with a twist because of the addition of 1 at each step. Wait, actually, when we expand the entire expression, it's a sum of powers of 3, but let me check. Let me try to expand the innermost expression step by step and see if I can find a pattern. Starting from the innermost: Layer1:1+3=4=1+3^1 Layer2:1+3*(1+3)=1+3+9=13=1+3+3^2 Layer3:1+3*(1+3+9)=1+3+9+27=40=1+3+3^2+3^3 Layer4:1+3*(1+3+9+27)=1+3+9+27+81=121=1+3+3^2+3^3+3^4 Wait a minute, this seems to be forming a geometric series. Each layer n adds the term 3^n. So, Layer1: sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k = (3^2 -1)/2=4, which is correct. Layer2: sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k= (3^3 -1)/2=13, correct. Layer3: sum from k=0 to3 of3^k=(3^4 -1)/2=40, correct. So, in general, Layer n: sum from k=0 to n of 3^k=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, Layer9: sum from k=0 to9 of3^k=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, which is what we had earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to9 of3^k)=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so 177147-3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's another way to see it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^n r^k = (r^{n+1}-1)/(r-1). Here, r=3, so sum_{k=0}^n 3^k = (3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step, solve the recurrence, or use the geometric series formula, I end up with the same result. It's reassuring that multiple methods lead to the same answer, which suggests that the solution is correct. Just to make sure, I can also compute the expression by expanding all the parentheses manually, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can compute each layer numerically again to confirm. Let me do that quickly: Layer1:1+3=4 Layer2:1+3*4=1+12=13 Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572.

Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final result would be 88572. Let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. This looks like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a relation can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire expression in terms of a single exponent, but since each layer is built upon the previous one, I think the way I did it is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recursive pattern, we find that each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). Solving this recurrence relation gives a closed-form formula, and after computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\) the previous term.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's try to model it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9, since the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, we can compute a_1 through a_9 using this recurrence. Let me compute them again using this formula to cross-verify: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the result is 88,572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, using the closed-form formula also gives the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, so each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break down the nested structure from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the total is 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize to make this easier, instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2. And so on. So, each layer is defined recursively. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln. Let's see. Let's try to find a pattern. Compute the first few layers:\n\nL1 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent Ln in terms of n. Let's see. Let's compute the ratio between each term and the previous term:\n\nL2 / L1 = 13 / 4 = 3.25\nL3 / L2 = 40 / 13 \u2248 3.077\nL4 / L3 = 121 / 40 = 3.025\nL5 / L4 = 364 / 121 \u2248 3.008\nL6 / L5 = 1093 / 364 \u2248 3.000\nL7 / L6 = 3280 / 1093 \u2248 3.000\nL8 / L7 = 9841 / 3280 \u2248 3.000\nL9 / L8 = 29524 / 9841 \u2248 3.000\n\nHmm, interesting. After L6, the ratio becomes exactly 3. So, maybe starting from L6, each term is 3 times the previous term. Let me check: L6 = 1093, L7 = 3*1093 = 3279, but in my earlier calculation, L7 was 3280. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Wait, 3*1093 is 3279, but I had L7 as 3280. So, that suggests that my earlier calculation might be wrong. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, L7 is 1 + 3*L6. So, L6 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280. So that's correct. So, L7 is 3280. Then L8 is 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. 9841 is 3*3280 + 1, which is correct. Similarly, L9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, starting from L6, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, but when I compute L7 as 3*1093 + 1, that's 3279 + 1 = 3280. Similarly, L8 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9840 + 1 = 9841. So, from L6 onwards, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Hmm, but that seems a bit inconsistent with the earlier terms where the ratio was approaching 3. Maybe there's a different pattern here. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series of some sort. Let me think. Let me try to express Ln in terms of n. Let's consider the recursion: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, for n >= 2, with L1 = 4. That's the recursive formula here. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. So, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L9, is equal to (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct because I double-checked each layer using the formula and the manual calculation, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows a recursive pattern, which can be expressed as a linear recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a general formula for each layer, allowing us to compute the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to find the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Recursive Formula**: Each layer Ln can be defined recursively as:\n   \\[\n   L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the initial condition \\( L_1 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved to find a closed-form expression:\n   \\[\n   L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute Layer 9**: Using the formula for n=9:\n   \\[\n   L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

So, putting it all together, 29524*3=88572. Wait, let me check that again because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me recheck each layer to see if I did the calculations correctly. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't skip any layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+\" starts a new layer, so let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n2. Then moving out, the next is 1+3(...), which is Layer 2.\n3. Continuing, Layer 3, Layer 4, Layer 5, Layer 6, Layer 7, Layer 8, Layer 9.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers in total. Therefore, the computation up to Layer 9 is correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming and error-prone, especially with 9 layers. Maybe there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here.\n\nLet me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => 0 = 1 + 2K => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form expression, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result, which increases my confidence. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all 9 layers, we find the outermost layer's value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, a_9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this expansion, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n+1}*a_0. Wait, but a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. So, perhaps the expansion is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me try expanding a few layers:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\n\nI see a pattern here. Each a_n is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, up to 3^{n} terms, plus an additional 3^{n+1} term. Wait, let me check:\n\na_1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 3^0 + 3^1\na_2 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2\nBut wait, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is correct. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 40. So, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that's exactly the formula we derived earlier! So, indeed, each a_n is the sum of the geometric series up to 3^n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524, as before. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572. So, all methods confirm that the result is 88,572. I think I've thoroughly checked this, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers up to the ninth, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. The final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27.

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 2788572 is a 7-digit number, but 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let's do it properly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can model this as a sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, computing up to a_9 gives us 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the innermost value and progressively compute each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost one. Multiplying the final result by 3 gives the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240.

Okay, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's plug in n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4.\n\nWe can find another equation by looking at n=2:\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the general solution for n=2:\n\n13 = A*3^2 + B => 9A + B = 13.\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, plug A back into the first equation:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly. Let me count the number of times the pattern repeats. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer.

Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1+3, each step adds a layer. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Wait, in the expression, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each time you go out, you add a layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses: Each time you have a ), which decreases by one each layer. Let me count the number of ) in the expression:\n\nStarting from the end:\n\n... (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another ). Let's count the number of )s:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) has 1 )\n2. (1+3(1+3)) has 2 )\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) has 3 )\n...\nContinuing this way, the outermost layer would have 9 )s, meaning there are 9 layers. So, n=9, which aligns with our earlier calculation. So, a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again without using the formula.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I've done this correctly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it using another approach or check for a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4, and we have a_9, then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, we can represent this as a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me write the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer.\n\nLet me denote the layers as L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\nL2=1 +3*L1=1+12=13\n\nL3=1 +3*L2=1+39=40\n\nL4=1+3*L3=1+120=121\n\nL5=1+3*L4=1+363=364\n\nL6=1+3*L5=1+1092=1093\n\nL7=1+3*L6=1+3279=3280\n\nL8=1+3*L7=1+9840=9841\n\nL9=1+3*L8=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step, just in case I made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nLayer1:1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\n3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4.

Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\nFinally, 4 * 3 = 12\nNow, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8\nSo, reading the result from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer was computed by taking 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer built upon that, multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, which was 29524, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result of 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate layers. Maybe I can check a couple of them again.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI know that such recurrence relations can often be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

I didn't make any arithmetic errors that I can see. So, the final result should be 88,572. But just to be thorough, let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this expression without computing each layer step by step. Let's see. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. We know that a_1 = 4, so:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B\n4 = 3A + B\n\nAlso, for the next term, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the general solution for a_2:\n\n13 = A*3^2 + B\n13 = 9A + B\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n6A = 9\nA = 9 / 6 = 3/2\n\nNow, substitute A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4\n9/2 + B = 4\nB = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think I've covered all the steps, checked my work, and even used a different method to confirm the result.

So the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I thought the expression was 3*(Layer 9). So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't miss a layer. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and there are 9 such layers. Then, after computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but when I was computing Layer 1 to Layer 9, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are 9 layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, perhaps I correctly computed up to Layer 9, then multiplied by 3. So, the result would be 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify the computation of Layer 9 again, because sometimes when you're dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*(Layer2)=1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*(Layer3)=1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*(Layer4)=1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*(Layer5)=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*(Layer6)=1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*(Layer7)=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*(Layer8)=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer9 is 29524, then multiply by 3 to get the final result: 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the expression is correctly interpreted. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, 9 layers, each adding another 1 +3(...). So, yes, Layer1 is 1+3=4, then Layer2 is 1+3*4=13, and so on until Layer9 is 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try an alternative approach to see if I get the same result. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 +3 =4\n\na_2 =1 +3*a1=1+12=13\n\na_3=1 +3*a2=1+39=40\n\na_4=1 +3*a3=1+120=121\n\na_5=1 +3*a4=1+363=364\n\na_6=1 +3*a5=1+1092=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*a6=1+3279=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*a7=1+9840=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*a8=1+29523=29524\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.

Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\na1=4\n\na2=13\n\na3=40\n\na4=121\n\na5=364\n\na6=1093\n\na7=3280\n\na8=9841\n\na9=29524\n\nI can try to see if there's a recurrence relation here. Each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)}= D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 3*D +1\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD -3D =1\n\n-2D=1 => D= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} -1/2\n\n4 =3C -1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 +1/2 =3C\n\n9/2=3C\n\nC= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1:\n\na1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for a9, which is Layer9, n=9:\n\na9= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes in the exponents. 3^10 is 59049, right?\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^10=59049, so a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. So, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer from the innermost outward and applying the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, we find the total to be 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of 1 + 3(...) repeated nine times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the formula**: Using the recurrence relation, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, is the final answer 88572? Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check a couple of layers again. Let's check Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total 3000+279=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524*3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. But wait, that's digit-wise multiplication, but I need to carry over correctly.

    "text": " The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total would be 88572.

That seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the numbers get larger each time. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous term. Let's denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let's compute a_9 using this formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct because both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. It's always good to verify with different methods to be sure.
