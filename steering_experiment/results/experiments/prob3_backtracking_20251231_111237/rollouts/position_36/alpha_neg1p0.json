Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up. Let me verify each layer step by step again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, I think my final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, we have L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think this is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation lead to the same result. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Yes. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's find another condition. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 3*L_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Using the general formula: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 13 = 9A + B. Now we have two equations: 4 = 3A + B, and 13 = 9A + B. Let's subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, the value of the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula to cross-verify. For example, n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Which is what I had before. Similarly, n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the total would be 88,572.

Let's verify 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, just to make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate any step, let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let's count them: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then moving out, each 1+3(...) adds a new layer, so total layers from innermost to outermost are 9, as I thought earlier. So, Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed correctly. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, giving 88,572. Hmm, another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems feasible. Alternatively, this looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, a particular solution can be found since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For Layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, using the formula also leads me to the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 29000 * 3 = 87000, 524 * 3 = 1572. So adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let's compute it again: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Let me think differently. 29524 is 29,524. So, 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think I did that correctly, but let me try another approach just to be sure. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me define a sequence a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, the original expression is 3*a_9. Let me compute the terms a_1 through a_9: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, same result. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the explicit formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. So, a_9 = 29,524. Then, the original expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. That matches my earlier result. So, using both iterative computation and the explicit formula, I arrive at the same answer. I think I can be confident that 88,572 is the correct result. Just to recap, the key steps were recognizing the nested structure, computing each layer step by step, and then verifying the result using an explicit formula derived from the recurrence relation. This approach helped me avoid getting lost in the complexity of the nested parentheses and ensured accuracy by cross-verifying the result through different methods.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a recursive pattern where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recalculate Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That seems correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but I'm not sure if I counted the layers correctly. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of times I added a layer: I started at Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, which is correct because there are nine sets of parentheses after the initial 3(1+3(...)). So, 9 layers in total. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it might be correct. Let me check another way. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The solution to this kind of recurrence relation can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. Let me verify that. Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, which matches our case where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n*a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, so a_0 would be 1, because a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, which implies a_0 = 1. So, substituting into the formula: a_n = 3^n*1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplifying, a_n = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. That's correct, as I computed a_1=4. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. That's also correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct again. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

That seems right. But wait, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of times the pattern repeats. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, each layer is one more step. So, starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, we go up to Layer 9, which is the outermost inside the initial 3. So, yes, I think I did that correctly. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can represent this recursively. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a function f(n), where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 f(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 f(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 f(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 f(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 f(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 f(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about the recursive formula. Each f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is f(n) = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, with f(1) = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form f_p(n) = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, f(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: f(3) = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the recursive formula approach. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute f(n) using the formula for each n from 1 to 9 to ensure that it's correct. f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula holds for each layer. Therefore, using the formula, f(9)=29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed with a formula. Using the formula, we determine that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the outermost layer evaluating to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check once more because I might have missed a step. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, if we consider a_0, it would be 1 (since a_1=1+3*a_0, and a_0 would be 1). Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so a_0 is 1. So, using the recurrence, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's check if that's correct. Wait, actually, the innermost layer was Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1 = 4. So, for Layer 9, n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula for a_n, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer's value is calculated by multiplying the previous layer's result by 3 and then adding 1. This seems to follow a geometric progression or a recursive sequence. Let me think if there's a formula for such a sequence. The general form is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a(n) = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A - 3A = 1 \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, in our case, how many layers are there? Let's see: Starting from Layer 1 as the innermost, each subsequent layer adds one more 3(...). The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so n=9. So, a(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, if I had recognized the pattern earlier, I could have used the formula to compute it directly without calculating each layer. But since I didn't see it immediately, breaking it down step by step was a good approach.

So, reading the numbers from bottom up: 8,7,2,8,5,7,8,2,8. Wait, that seems off because I'm not sure how the digits stack up. Maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the expression, I see that after the first 3(1+3, there are eight more sets of (1+3(...)), each nested within the previous one. So, actually, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost, which I think I accounted for correctly.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Let me make sure that the number of layers corresponds correctly. Each time, I go one layer out, so starting from 1+3, that's one layer, then each additional (1+3(...)) adds another layer. Since the original expression has nine layers of (1+3(...)), I think I correctly computed up to Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in my initial count, I labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, so the outermost would be Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nLet me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nL_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1: L_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, this formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me compute each layer again using the formula:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer checks out with the formula, which gives me confidence that L_9 is indeed 29524, and thus the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, so it's a geometric series. But since the problem is only 9 layers deep, computing each step manually or using the formula seems manageable.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This pattern follows a recurrence relation which can be solved to find the value of the outermost layer. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

So, if I let L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume L_n = C. Then, C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 ... And so on. So, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer using the formula. Let's say n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches what I had before. So, the formula is reliable. Thus, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think. Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. To find a particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I can't spot any errors in my reasoning, and the formula approach also leads me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I started from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer by substituting the previous layer's result, and then finally multiplied the outermost layer by 3.

So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048. Divided by 2: 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 as 29,524. Therefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 manually: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048, divided by 2 is 29,524. Multiply by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24. So, 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think I've thoroughly checked this. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute this in a different way. Let me think about the structure of this expression. It's a series of nested expressions where each one is 1 + 3*(the next one). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9, and the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, that seems like a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's check this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121.

Therefore, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 manually.\n\n3*29524:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 30000*3=90000.\n\nSubtract 476*3: because 30000 - 476 = 29524.\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, maybe compute 29524*3 as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That also works.\n\nYes, so 88572 is indeed the correct result.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, and everything adds up correctly. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be represented by the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Calculating up to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure: Each term is 1 + 3*(next term).\n2. Compute each layer from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Let me check that multiplication again. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar because each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = -1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (-1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, this method also confirms the result. Therefore, I'm doubly sure that the answer is correct. It's interesting how recognizing the recurrence relation can simplify the computation, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, though it was a bit time-consuming. Anyway, I think I've solved it correctly. The final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because these numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again more carefully.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute this carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400=29400; 29400 + 120=29520; 29520 + 3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me see: Starting from the first 3, then (1+3(... So, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see: 1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...))\n\nWait, so actually, starting from the first 3, there are nine layers of 1+3(...). So, I did compute up to Layer 9, which is correct. Therefore, my calculation should be accurate. Just to be thorough, let me compute each layer once more, just to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can approach it differently. Perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's model it as a recurrence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, actually, in our case, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is Layer 2. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is Layer 3. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, how can we solve this recurrence relation? It's a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Let me confirm: The innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, Layer n: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and the formula, I arrived at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. 3. Realize that each layer follows a recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques for linear recurrences. 4. Derive the general formula for the nth layer and apply it to find the value of the outermost layer. 5. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer. 6. Verify each step and the final multiplication to ensure accuracy. This process helped me break down the problem and avoid getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the nested expressions. It's also a good reminder of how recurrence relations can be useful in solving problems with repetitive structures.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me compute that again to be sure: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this is a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. I remember that such recursions can often be solved using the method for solving linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, which in this case is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (L_1 + (b/(1 - a))) * (a)^{n-1} - (b/(1 - a)). Wait, let me check that formula again. For a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n-1}*L_1 + b*(a^{n-1} - 1)/(a - 1). Let me verify that. If I expand it, for n=1: L_1 = a^{0}*L_1 + b*(a^{0} - 1)/(a - 1) = L_1 + b*(1 - 1)/(a - 1) = L_1 + 0 = L_1, which is correct. For n=2: L_2 = a*L_1 + b. Using the formula: a^{1}*L_1 + b*(a^{1} - 1)/(a - 1) = a*L_1 + b*(a - 1)/(a - 1) = a*L_1 + b, which matches. So, the formula seems correct. Applying this to our case, where a = 3 and b = 1, and L_1 = 4. So, L_n = 3^{n-1}*4 + 1*(3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1). Simplifying: L_n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Let me factor out 3^{n-1}: L_n = (4 + 1/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Wait, let me compute that again. 4 is equal to 8/2, so 8/2 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, L_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as before. For n=3: L_3 = (9/2)*3^{2} - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), L_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let me compute that. First, 3^8 is 6561. So, 9/2 * 6561 = (9 * 6561)/2. Let me compute 9*6561: 9*6000=54000, 9*500=4500, 9*60=540, 9*1=9. Adding those together: 54000 + 4500 = 58500, 58500 + 540 = 59040, 59040 + 9 = 59049. So, 9*6561 = 59049. Then, 59049 / 2 = 29524.5. Now, subtracting 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, L_9 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, both by computing each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. This makes me confident that the answer is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me try computing one more layer using the formula to ensure consistency. Let's take n=4: Using the formula, L_4 = (9/2)*3^{3} - 1/2 = (9/2)*27 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Which is exactly what I got earlier when computing manually. So, the formula holds. Therefore, I can trust that the final result after computing all nine layers and multiplying by 3 is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Finally, multiply by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's do this again to confirm. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n represent the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives the same result as computing each layer step by step. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yes, that's the same as before. So, the total is 88,572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, which could save me from computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, and we have 9 layers in total, so the outermost layer is Layer 9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same answer, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence. This method is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since we only had 9 layers, both methods worked. I think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So, putting it together: 88572. So the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems pretty big, but considering how many layers there are, it might make sense. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 1 + 3(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve it as a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The standard approach for such a recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the innermost layer, n=1, and the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, so 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. That's reassuring. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. That's a good way to check. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final result. It's always good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure that the answer is correct. So, I think I'm confident that the solution is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Finally, multiply by 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute this again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72.

Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 directly: 29,524 * 3 = (29,500 + 24) * 3 = 29,500*3 + 24*3 = 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's consistent. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the original expression starts with 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. That seems correct. Let me just make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is one more 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can express a_n in terms of a_1. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, expanding this, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. And so on. This seems like each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me confirm that formula. Yes, for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). In our case, c = 3 and d = 1. Wait, but our initial condition is a_1 = 4, not a_0. Let me adjust for that. Let me redefine the sequence so that a_0 is the innermost term. Wait, no, in our problem, the innermost term is a_1 = 4, and then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, n starts at 1. So, maybe it's better to adjust the formula accordingly. Alternatively, let's see if we can find a pattern. Let me compute a few terms: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's what I had before. So, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we're dealing with a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That matches our earlier computation. So, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it both by iterative computation and by using the recurrence relation formula, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in the previous steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which I calculated as 88572. Let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, 29524*3=88572. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the initial calculation of the layers. Let me check Layer 9 again. Layer 8 is 9841. So, 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 =29524. Correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), but in my calculation, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, which is correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them again. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(...)) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, if I have nine layers, then Layer 1 is 1+3, Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer 9. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers get large quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. So, we have: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Subtracting C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, the same result. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

    "text": " 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic, especially with large numbers. Let me verify each layer computation again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364 * 3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 * 3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 * 3. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the final step: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7, 7, 5, 7, 2, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should write it out properly.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that matches my previous calculation. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can't see any mistakes in my steps. Each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 also checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated until the outermost layer is reached. Finally, the result of the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to obtain the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   Compute the innermost parentheses:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   Substitute Layer 1 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   Substitute Layer 2 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   Substitute Layer 3 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   Substitute Layer 4 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   Substitute Layer 5 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   Substitute Layer 6 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   Substitute Layer 7 into the next layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   Substitute Layer 8 into the outermost layer:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Step:**  \n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty big. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula I can apply instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it properly. First, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the general formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. So, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that. Let me denote S as the innermost expression: S = 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with 8 more layers. But that might get complicated. Alternatively, considering that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which we've already solved. So, I think the approach using the recurrence relation is solid. Therefore, I can be confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.
