Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.

Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. Wait, actually, let me write it out digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1 =7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me verify with another method. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3 can be thought of as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That matches, so it's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each layer computation because sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution: L_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nAt n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nAt n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nAt n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula holds.\n\nThus, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 *29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3.

Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29,524. Let me compute that again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So yes, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Let me count them again: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one layer, and each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3*(...)\" So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+3(...). Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses inside: Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. So starting from the innermost, which is the last \"1+3\", that's Layer 1. Then moving outward, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1+3\n2. Layer 2: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Layer 3: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Layer 4: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. Layer 5: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. Layer 6: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. Layer 7: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. Layer 8: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. Layer 9: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's actually nine layers. But when I computed earlier, I went up to Layer 9 as 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be expressed recursively. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, if I can find a general formula for L_n, that might help me compute it without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Let's substitute the general solution into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate the coefficients of like terms on both sides: For 3^n terms: A*3^n = A*3^n \u21d2 This holds for any A. For constant terms: B = 1 + 3B \u21d2 B - 3B = 1 \u21d2 -2B = 1 \u21d2 B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1=4. So, L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. We can factor out 1/2: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works for the initial layers. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm it's 59,049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check once more because sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to miscount. Let me list the powers of 3 up to 3^10 to be absolutely sure: 3^1=3 3^2=9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10=59,049. Therefore, L_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Wait, this expression is similar to a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence approach also led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct.

So the result is 88572. Wait, that's 88572. Hmm, but when I think about it, each layer seems to be growing exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me avoid computing each layer manually. The expression inside each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think the solution to such a recurrence is a geometric progression. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s, the solution is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + s*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). In our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So here, r=3, s=1. So the solution would be a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, so maybe a_0 would be 1. Let me check. If n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. Since a_1=4, then 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => a_0 = (4 -1)/3 = 1. So a_0=1. Then the general formula would be a_n = 3^{n}*1 + (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1) = 3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2. Let's simplify that: a_n = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)): Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me see: Each time we have a 1 + 3(...), so from the innermost, there are 9 such layers because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Wait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another, so up to Layer 9. So the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So let's compute a_9 first: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this makes sense because each layer is growing exponentially, and using the formula saved me time instead of computing each layer individually. It's good to recognize the pattern and apply the appropriate formula to solve it efficiently.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).

But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution: The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.

For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572, as I computed earlier. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form expression. That was a good exercise because it confirmed my initial step-by-step computation. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely thorough, let me try to compute one more layer manually to ensure that my method is correct. Let's compute Layer 5 again: Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer4. Layer4 was 121, so 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Alternatively, using the formula: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, everything checks out. Therefore, I'm certain that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier because when I was computing Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88,572. Let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13.

But wait, I just realized that the original expression has nine layers, but when I started counting, I considered the innermost as Layer 1, and the outermost as Layer 9, which is correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. Let's compute L(1) to L(9):\n\nL(1)=4\n\nL(2)=1 +3*4=13\n\nL(3)=1 +3*13=40\n\nL(4)=1 +3*40=121\n\nL(5)=1 +3*121=364\n\nL(6)=1 +3*364=1093\n\nL(7)=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nL(8)=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nL(9)=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, L(9)=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*L(9)=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but it's nested, so maybe it's a bit different. Let me see if I can find a formula for L(n). The recurrence relation is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: L(1)=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. And the recurrence relation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1)=1. Using the homogeneous and particular solutions, but maybe it's easier to find a pattern. Let's compute L(n):\n\nn | L(n)\n1 | 4\n2 |13\n3 |40\n4 |121\n5 |364\n6 |1093\n7 |3280\n8 |9841\n9 |29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can see that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L(n) = 3*L(n-1) +1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p(n) = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^(n+1))/2 -1/2= (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L(n)= (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9: L(9)= (3^10 -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, L(9)=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^10. Since the outermost layer is 3*(L(9))=3*( (3^10 -1)/2 )= (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the result is 88,572.\n\nLet me just confirm once more by computing the layers again:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nMultiply by 3:29524*3=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me compute that again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote the layers as a sequence a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each term step by step. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer: 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold for the first few layers. Therefore, for n = 9, the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula, we determine that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). The structure repeats nine times, with the entire expression multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost parentheses, compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n4. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation:**\n   Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive the formula:\n   - a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n   - For n = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\n   - Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the final result should be 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error in any step.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. Each layer's computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Let me define the layers as a sequence where each term is defined by a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to compute a_9 directly without computing each a_i step by step.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain number of terms. But in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit different. However, using the recurrence relation and solving it as I did above seems more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize that each time we're adding 1 and then tripling it, which is similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, maybe using induction to prove the formula for a_n, but since we've already verified it with multiple layers, I think it's safe.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we compute each step and find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check for any errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could compute this without having to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. The recurrence relation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, L1 is 4, which is when n=1. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series. The recurrence relation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, but what's the initial condition? Let me check. When n=1, L1=4. So, plugging n=1 into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, that's L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, that's L2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, that's L3=40. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1 = 59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier for L9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^{10}=59,049; 3^{11}=177,147. So, 3^{11}=177,147. Then, (177,147 -3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which gives the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nTo solve this, we recognize a repeating pattern where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. \n\nUsing the recurrence relation Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, we find that each layer can be expressed as Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. \n\nFinally, multiplying by 3 gives the result: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my calculations because 3*29,524 is actually 88,572. Wait, no, that's correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the initial expression starts with 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, if I compute up to Layer 9, which is the outermost, and then multiply by 3, that should be correct. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting with 3(...), then inside that is 1 + 3(...), which is the first layer. Then inside that is another 1 + 3(...), so that's the second layer, and so on. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(...Layer 9...)\n2. 1 + 3(...Layer 8...)\n3. 1 + 3(...Layer 7...)\n4. 1 + 3(...Layer 6...)\n5. 1 + 3(...Layer 5...)\n6. 1 + 3(...Layer 4...)\n7. 1 + 3(...Layer 3...)\n8. 1 + 3(...Layer 2...)\n9. 1 + 3(...Layer 1...)\n10. 1 + 3\n\nWait, that's actually 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, the initial 3 is multiplied by Layer 9, which we computed as 29,524. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. So, the expression is 3*a_9. Let's see if we can find a recurrence relation here. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to solve it iteratively since it's only 9 terms. Let me try that again.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's try to expand this.\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2})\n= 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\nContinuing this way, each step adds another power of 3.\n\nSo, after expanding all the way down to a_1, we get:\n\na_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_1\n\nWait, but a_1 is 4, so maybe that's not exactly a geometric series, but let's see.\n\nWait, when n=9, a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_7)\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_7\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a_6)\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a_6\nContinuing this way, eventually, we'll have a_9 = sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k + 3^9*a_0, but wait, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3, so maybe a_0 would be 1? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe this approach isn't the best. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the standard solution for a recurrence relation a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1) * c + k^{n} * a_0. But in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, k=3, c=1. The solution would be a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) + 3^{n}*a_0. But in our case, a_1 = 4. Let me see if this fits.\n\nWait, if n=1, then a_1 = 4. Using the formula: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/(3 - 1) + 3^1*a_0 = (3 - 1)/2 + 3*a_0 = 2/2 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*a_0. But we know a_1 = 4, so 1 + 3*a_0 = 4 => a_0 = (4 - 1)/3 = 1.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 3^{n}*1 = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 3^{n} = (3^{n} - 1 + 2*3^{n})/2 = (3^{n} + 2*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1 = 4. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check using another method, like breaking down 29524 into parts.\n\n29524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24.\n\n3*20,000 = 60,000\n\n3*9,000 = 27,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying each computation, and even using a formula to confirm the result, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step and then multiplying the outermost result by 3, we arrive at the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " Final result: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524. Let me break it down: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Wait, but hold on, that seems like a big number. Let me verify my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't miscalculate any step. Starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That's correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total 9000+840=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding up: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\nBreak it down:\n20000 *3 =60000\n9000 *3=27000\n500 *3=1500\n20 *3=60\n4*3=12\n\nNow add them up:\n60000 +27000=87000\n87000 +1500=88500\n88500 +60=88560\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did it the first time, I got 88572, and now I'm getting the same number. So maybe that's correct. But let me check if the number of layers is correct because sometimes when you count layers, you might miscount. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first opening parenthesis after the initial 3, each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1+3(...)\n2. (1+3(...)\n3. (1+3(...)\n4. (1+3(...)\n5. (1+3(...)\n6. (1+3(...)\n7. (1+3(...)\n8. (1+3(...)\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nYes, that's nine layers, so Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, computing each layer up to Layer 9 is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that might be too large. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe general solution is a_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find the particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nP = 1 + 3*P\n\nSolving for P:\n\nP - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. If I expand it all out, it's a sum of terms where each term is 3 raised to some power. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Wait, but actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each layer adds another 3 times that. So, when expanded, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*4))). If I expand it all the way, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))).\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern where each layer adds a term multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers. Wait, let me think. Each time you have 1 + 3*something, so when you expand it, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) which would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some term. But in this case, since it's nested nine times, maybe the expansion would involve 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9, but multiplied by some factors. Wait, no, because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time you go out a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression E can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with n layers. Let me try to find a pattern for E in terms of n.\n\nIf n=1: E = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\nn=2: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\nn=3: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\nWait, but according to my earlier calculations, for n=3, the layer 3 was 40, so E=3*40=120. Hmm, but when I computed n=3 as layer 3, which was 40, so E=120. But according to the closed-form formula, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, so E=3*40=120. Correct.\n\nBut in this approach, E(n) = 3*a_n, where a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so E(n) = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then E(n) = 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: E(1)= (3^{3} -3)/2 = (27 -3)/2=24/2=12. Correct, as above.\n\nn=2: (3^4 -3)/2=(81-3)/2=78/2=39. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^5 -3)/2=(243-3)/2=240/2=120. Correct.\n\nSo, for n=9, E(9)= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=3*59049=177147.\n\nThus, E(9)= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, this method also gives 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. Each time we have 1 + 3*(...), which can be seen as adding 1 and then scaling the rest by 3. But I think the approach using the closed-form formula for the recursive sequence is more straightforward here.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute E(9) using the formula E(n)=(3^{n+2}-3)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{11}-3)/2. As above, 3^11=177147, so 177147-3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nI think I've verified it sufficiently. So, the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me verify this. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series, but the way it's structured, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can model this. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general form is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed. So, yeah, that seems solid. I think I've got it right. No mistakes noticed in the steps, and the formula confirms the result. So, confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Hmm, but let me double-check my earlier layers because I might have made a mistake in one of them. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 4*3=12, 6*3=18 +1=19, 3*3=9 +1=10. So 364*3=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 3*3=9, 9*3=27, 0*3=0, 1*3=3. Wait, that's 3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 0*3=0, 8*3=24, 2*3=6 +2=8, 3*3=9. Wait, 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. Wait, 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, I can use the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer individually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9, which is the outermost expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, each a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a(n). Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a(n) = 3*a(n-1), whose solution is a(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.

So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify each step again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let's go through each layer once more. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems consistent. Wait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when you carry over, it's easy to make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: Let's compute it as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. 20,000 *3=60,000. 9,000 *3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 20*3=60. 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, but since the number of layers isn't too large, just nine, computing each layer is manageable. Alternatively, this seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on, up to a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general form is a_n = c*3^n + d, where d is a constant particular solution. Let's find d. Assuming a particular solution is a constant d, substituting into the recurrence: d = 1 + 3d => d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = c*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = c*3^1 - 1/2 = 3c - 1/2 = 4. Solving for c: 3c = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => c = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. That's probably a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger, as it avoids computing each layer individually. But since the problem only has nine layers, both methods are feasible. Either way, the result is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The question is, can I find a closed-form expression for L_n? Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, and since it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence, I can solve it using standard techniques. First, let's write the homogeneous part: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n^(h) = 3*L_{n-1}^(h). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^(p) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. Good, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*L_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which is the same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive formula approach as well as the closed-form formula both lead to the same result.

So, the result should be 88,572. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.

Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series, but given that each term is multiplied by 3, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied instead of computing each layer manually. Let me try to see if there's a pattern here. Let's consider that each Layer n is equal to 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, so each Layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous Layer. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln in terms of n. Let's try to find a pattern or perhaps solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. Let's compute a few more terms to see if a pattern emerges. L1 = 4 L2 = 13 L3 = 40 L4 = 121 L5 = 364 L6 = 1093 L7 = 3280 L8 = 9841 L9 = 29524 Hmm, I notice that each term seems to be 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, that's exactly the recurrence relation. So, perhaps the solution is of the form Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's try substituting into the recurrence relation. Assume Ln = A*3^n + B. Then, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1 becomes A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B). Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the homogeneous solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. To be thorough, I can also compute each layer using the formula to confirm. For example, Layer 1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =4, correct. Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. Layer 3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. Layer 4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. Layer 5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct. Layer 6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct. Layer 7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct. Layer 8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct. Layer 9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct. So, each layer checks out with the formula.

Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, this is a recursive function where each term is defined based on the previous one. So, f(1) = 4, f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This seems to match the layers I calculated earlier. Now, the problem is that we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, f(9) would be the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then we multiply that by 3. So, our total expression is 3*f(9). Now, to find f(9), we can either compute each term step by step, which I did earlier, or find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's try to find a closed-form formula for f(n). The recursive relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution f_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: f(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as I calculated earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*f(9) =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. Then, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute that step by step: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Let me compute 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute it without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I end up with the same answer, 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving the recurrence relation, we find that each layer a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, we have L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29,524. Then, 3*L_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^10=59,049; 3^11=177,147. So, 3^{11}=177,147. Then, (177,147 -3)/2=177,144/2=88,572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get 88,572 as the final answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Final Answer: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me do that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So adding up each part: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, 88572 is correct. Therefore, the final result should be 88572. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and maybe I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. We can also look at the next term to find another equation. a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtracting the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plugging A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different approaches\u2014iterative computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014both give the same result.

So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about this. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it using another method or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help me confirm the result. I remember that expressions like this, where each term is defined recursively, can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... And so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121 \u2714\ufe0f For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 =728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect! So, the closed-form formula works, which gives me more confidence that the step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, a_9 =29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 *3: 20000*3=60,000; 9000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000+1,500=88,500; 88,500+72=88,572. Yep, that's correct.

Wait, but that's only 5 digits. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so 3*29524 should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Wait, 29524 is less than 30,000, so 3*29524 is less than 90,000, which is a 5-digit number. So, 29524*3=88,572, which is correct. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think I've checked it thoroughly, both by step-by-step computation and by using a closed-form formula for the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, so I feel certain that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is a_1 =4, then a_2=13, up to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I expand the entire expression, it might look like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*1)...)). So, if I write it out, it's 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... up to nine terms? Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so when I expand it, each term is multiplied by 3^(n-1), where n is the number of layers. Wait, perhaps I can model it as a sum. Let me try to write the expression step by step. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me see how many terms there are. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer adds another 3^k term. Maybe it's similar to a geometric series where each term is 3^k, but with some coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps I can express E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) up to 9 layers. Wait, but that's similar to the layers I computed earlier. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1=4, then a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 as before. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, E=3*a_9=88572. That's the same result as before. So, perhaps using the recurrence relation is the most straightforward way. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the expression. Let's start by writing E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try expanding this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. The innermost is (1 + 3) =4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 +3*4=13. Then, 1 +3*13=40, and so on, as I did before. Alternatively, perhaps I can write E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)))) with nine layers. Let me see how many terms that would give. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, the innermost term is 1 +3, which is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 +3*4=13, which can be written as 1 +3*(1 +3). Then, the next layer is 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)), which is 1 +3*13=40. So, each layer is 1 +3 times the previous layer. So, when I expand E, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, if I expand all the layers, it would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))))))))) Wait, since the innermost is 4, as we saw before. Let me try to expand it:\n\nStart from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3 =4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think. Each layer adds a term that is 3^n, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, and a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and E=3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of E as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with 9 layers, which would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, expanding this, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers from that point. Let me see:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, expanding each layer:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)))))))))\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can express E as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's see: Each time you have a 1, and then 3 times the next layer. So, when you expand it all the way, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. Let me try to visualize it.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nAt Layer 1: 1 +3 =4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*(Layer1) =1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, each layer adds another term that's 3^k, where k is the number of layers. So, after 9 layers, the total would be 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^8, multiplied by some factor? Wait, not exactly, because each layer is 1 +3*(...), so when you expand, it's more like 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...)).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total sum is 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^8, but that's a geometric series with 9 terms, starting from 3^0 up to 3^8.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer is 1 +3*(previous), so the expansion would actually be 1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) which is 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^8. So, the sum S =1 +3 +9 +27 +81 +243 +729 +2187 +6561.\n\nLet me compute that sum:\n\n1 +3 =4\n\n4 +9=13\n\n13 +27=40\n\n40 +81=121\n\n121 +243=364\n\n364 +729=1093\n\n1093 +2187=3280\n\n3280 +6561=9841\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, S=9841, which is exactly a_8, as we computed earlier. Then, the next layer would be 1 +3*S =1 +3*9841=29524, which is a_9. Then, E=3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the sum S =1 +3 +9 +27 +81 +243 +729 +2187 +6561.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n1 +3 =4\n\n4 +9=13\n\n13 +27=40\n\n40 +81=121\n\n121 +243=364\n\n364 +729=1093\n\n1093 +2187=3280\n\n3280 +6561=9841.\n\nSo, S=9841. Then, the next term is 1 +3*S=1 +3*9841=29524, and then E=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but S here is the sum up to 3^8, which is 9841, and then the next layer is 1 +3*S, which is 29524, and then E=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression E as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with 9 layers, which would be equivalent to 3*( (3^{9} -1)/2 ). Wait, no, because from the recurrence relation, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then E=3*a_9=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of E as 3*( (3^{9} -1)/2 +1 ). Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the recurrence relation, a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nSo, a_1=4=(3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4.\n\na_2=13=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13.\n\nSimilarly, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for a geometric series. The sum S =1 +3 +3^2 +...+3^{n} = (3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, S=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, which matches a_9. Then, E=3*S=88572.\n\nWait, but in our case, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) which is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) up to 9 layers, which is 3*(a_9). So, E=3*a_9=3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that's another way to express it.\n\nSo, E= (3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nThat's a neat formula. So, if I have n layers, E= (3^{n+1}-3)/2.\n\nIn this case, n=9, so E=(3^{10}-3)/2? Wait, no, wait: Let me check. Wait, in the expression, each layer is 1 +3*(...), and we have 9 layers. So, from the innermost, a_1=4, up to a_9=29524, then E=3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, E= (3^{10}-3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10}=59049, so (59049 -3)/2=59046/2=29523. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, earlier I had E=3*a_9=3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nYes, because a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, so E=3*a_9= (3*(3^{10}-1))/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147, so E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's correct.\n\nSo, another way to write E is (3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer.\n\nBut since the problem is to compute this expression step by step, perhaps the first method is more illustrative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 +3*(...), which can be represented as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, the sum S =1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^{n}.\n\nIn our case, with 9 layers, n=9, so S=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, as before.\n\nThen, E=3*S=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to think about it.\n\nBut to make sure, perhaps I can compute each layer again to confirm:\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3*29524 directly.\n\nLet me compute 29524 *3:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I should write it down properly:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\nBut wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n29524\n\n*    3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 *3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5 *3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 *3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom up: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. From the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to ensure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Good, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute a few more layers using the formula to make sure. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, yes, the formula works, and thus the final result is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since each term also adds 1, it's a bit more complex. The closed-form formula we derived simplifies the computation significantly, avoiding the need to calculate each layer manually, which is especially useful if there were more layers. So, in conclusion, by working through each layer step by step and then verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Closed-Form Formula:**\n   The closed-form solution for the nth layer is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For n=9, \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as follows: 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1.

Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4 (Layer 1). Then, moving out, each time adding another layer.
