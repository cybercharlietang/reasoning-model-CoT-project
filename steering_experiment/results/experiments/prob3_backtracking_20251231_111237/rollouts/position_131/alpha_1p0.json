Just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers using both methods and see if they match. For example, layer 1: a_1 = 4. Using the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: a_2 = 13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3: a_3 = 40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.

So, maybe the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers.

So, both methods agree. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 3s inside. Wait, actually, each layer adds another 3, so it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with nine layers. But perhaps another way to model this is to recognize that each time you add a layer, you're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to how numbers are built in base 3 or something. But maybe that's overcomplicating it. The step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation both led me to the same answer, so I think 88572 is correct. Just to be thorough, let me recompute the layers one more time: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572 Yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) step by step using substitution. Let me try that approach as well. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 3s. But actually, since it's nested nine times, each substitution would reduce the number of layers by one. Let me see:\n\nStart with the innermost expression: Let me define E_1 = 1 + 3. Then E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1. Then E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2, and so on, up to E_9. Then, the final answer is 3*E_9.\n\nWhich is exactly what I did before. So, E_1 = 4, E_2=13, E_3=40, E_4=121, E_5=364, E_6=1093, E_7=3280, E_8=9841, E_9=29524. Then, 3*E_9=88572. So, yes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to compute it from the outside, I might get confused, so working from the inside is definitely the way to go. Let me try that approach just to check.\n\nWait, starting from the outside: The entire expression is 3*(...). Let me compute the innermost part first, which is 1 + 3, then work my way out.\n\nBut that's the same as before. So, regardless of the approach, I end up with 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me see if I can represent this as a sum.\n\nEach time, the 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. So, for example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, because it's inside eight layers. Similarly, the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nWait, let me see: Let's think of the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nEach '1' is inside a certain number of 3s. The innermost 1 is inside 8 layers, so it's multiplied by 3^8, the next one is inside 7 layers, so 3^7, etc., up to the outermost 1, which is inside 0 layers, so 3^0=1.\n\nBut actually, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) + something? Wait, maybe not exactly.\n\nWait, let me think. Each time, you have 1 + 3*(...). So, if I expand it, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). So, the coefficients of each 1 would be 3^0, 3^1, 3^2, etc., but I need to make sure.\n\nWait, let's try expanding the entire expression step by step.\n\nLet me denote the expression as E. Then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers.\n\nLet me try to write it out as a sum:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me try to expand this:\n\nFirst, the innermost part is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, as before.\n\nBut if I were to represent E as a sum, it would be:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me see how many terms there are. Each '1' is multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers above it. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nSo, the total sum inside the outermost parentheses would be sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k.\n\nWait, but actually, each 1 is part of a nested expression. So, perhaps the sum is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, but multiplied by something.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me denote S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Then, S is a geometric series with 9 terms, starting from 3^0 to 3^8.\n\nThe sum S = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Earlier, I had Layer 8 as 9841, which is the same as S here. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*S = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, which is consistent with what I found before.\n\nSo, in this case, the sum S = 9841 is the sum of 3^0 to 3^8, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 6561.\n\nBut in our problem, each '1' is part of a nested expression, so it's not exactly the same as the sum S. However, the sum S is equal to Layer 8, which is 9841, so that's consistent.\n\nThen, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*Layer 9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 = 1 + 3*Layer 8, and so on, it's the same as the recursive approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum where each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers above it, but I need to ensure I'm accounting for the multiplications correctly.\n\nWait, let me try to represent E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))).\n\nEach '1' is inside a certain number of 3s. The innermost '1' is inside 8 layers, so it's multiplied by 3^8. The next '1' is inside 7 layers, so 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost '1' which is inside 0 layers, so 3^0.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k.\n\nWait, but the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is S = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841, as I computed before.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is S = 9841, so the total expression is 3*S = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier result. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but if I model it as 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*9841 = 29523, which is different. So, where is the mistake here?\n\nAh, I think I see the issue. The expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is not just the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, because each '1' is part of a nested expression, so the total expression is actually 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer 8, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*Layer 7), etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way to model it is that the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 = 1 + 3*Layer 8, and so on, leading to Layer 9 = (3^9 - 1)/2 + 1? Wait, no, let me think.\n\nWait, earlier I found that Layer 8 = 9841, which is equal to (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841. Then Layer 9 = 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*Layer 9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 = (3^9 + 1)/2? Wait, no, because (3^9 +1)/2 = (19683 + 1)/2 = 19684/2 = 9842, which is not equal to Layer 9, which is 29524.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a different formula. Let me think of the expression as a recurrence relation where each Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4.\n\nWe found that Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with eight layers inside.\n\nBut that's the same as E = 3*(Layer 9). So, I think the confusion arises when trying to model it as a sum, but the correct approach is to use the recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a geometric series with a ratio of 3, but I need to adjust for the fact that each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nWait, let me try to express E as a sum:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers.\n\nLet me expand it:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1s. Each layer adds another 1. So, there are nine 1s, each multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers above them.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, because it's inside eight layers.\n\nThe next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0=1.\n\nTherefore, the sum inside the expression is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8.\n\nWait, that's the same as S = sum_{k=0}^8 3^k = (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841.\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*S = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but that's different from what I had before. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, earlier I computed Layer 9 as 29524, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut if I model it as 3*S, where S is the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is 9841, then E = 3*9841 = 29523, which is different.\n\nSo, where is the mistake here?\n\nAh, I think the confusion is that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(Layer 9), but Layer 9 is not equal to S, but rather Layer 9 = 1 + 3*Layer 8, and Layer 8 = S.\n\nWait, no, because Layer 8 is 9841, which is equal to S, the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k.\n\nBut Layer 9 = 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, E = 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the mistake in the previous approach was that I was considering E = 3*S, but actually, E = 3*(1 + 3*S), which is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nTherefore, E = 3*(1 + 3*S) = 3*1 + 3*3*S = 3 + 9*S = 3 + 9*9841 = 3 + 88569 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*S) where S is the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, which is 9841. Therefore, E = 3*(1 + 3*9841) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to model this as a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with each term being 1, the sum would be different because each term is not just 1, but 1 multiplied by 3 raised to some power.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is that each '1' is contributing 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. So, the total sum inside the outermost parentheses is sum_{k=0}^8 3^k = 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*(sum_{k=0}^8 3^k) = 3*9841 = 29523. But that's not correct because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Therefore, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the key is that the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is not just the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k, but rather 1 + 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Wait, no, because the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is 9841, and then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, which is Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the confusion arises when trying to model it as a simple geometric series, but the structure of the expression requires a recursive approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series with a finite number of terms. The sum S = (r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case, the common ratio is 3, and the number of terms is 9 (from 3^0 to 3^8). So, S = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nThen, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is 1 + 3*S = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, to summarize, the expression can be computed by recognizing that the innermost parentheses sum up to a geometric series, and then each subsequent layer adds another term multiplied by 3. By computing the sum of the geometric series and then applying the multiplications step by step, we arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times with different methods, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer successively, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure:** The expression is a nested series with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute each layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:** \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds a 1 and multiplies by 3, so it's like a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the entire expression step by step, as I did before, but perhaps in a more systematic way.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet me define the innermost expression as E1, then E2, up to E9, where E9 is the outermost expression before multiplying by 3.\n\nSo:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this step-by-step approach confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers. Since there are 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 in another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying with a closed-form formula, and double-checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. Because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, when I counted the layers earlier, I considered the innermost as Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds one more, so Layer 9 would be the outermost. So, in the expression, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the computation seems accurate. Alternatively, if I were to code this, I could write a loop that starts from the innermost value and iteratively computes each layer, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. Let me simulate that: Initialize value = 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1) Then, for each subsequent layer up to 9: value = 1 + 3*value. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 Yep, same result.

So, using the closed-form expression, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, 88572.

I think that's correct. To be thorough, let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

    "text": " Wait, that's the same as I computed earlier for Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572, which matches the previous result. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or find a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers again using the closed-form formula to see if they match. For example, Layer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. Layer 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. Layer 3: n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and 3 times that is 88572. I think that solidifies the answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the sum can be expressed as a geometric series. But in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one, it's a bit different. However, the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: Starting from the innermost layer, each time we have 1 + 3*(...), which can be expanded as 1 + 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to a certain number of terms. But given the nesting, it's a finite geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, but in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so it's like each layer adds another term in the series. So, maybe the total expression is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but multiplied by something. Wait, let's see: If I have Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*Layer7) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*Layer7, and so on, until Layer1: 1 + 3. So, Layer9 would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Wait, but that's a geometric series with 9 terms, starting from 3^0 to 3^8. The sum S = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but earlier, Layer9 was 29524, which is 3*9841 +1? Wait, no, that doesn't seem to align. Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.\n\nWait, no, perhaps each layer adds another power of 3. Let me think. When I have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 =4, as before, then the closed-form is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, as before. So, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression by expanding all the parentheses, but that would be tedious. Let me try a small example to see if the pattern holds. Suppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 =4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4=13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13=40. Then multiply by 3: 3*40=120. Alternatively, using the formula: n=3 layers. a3=(3^{4}-1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Then 3*a3=120. Correct. So, the formula works for smaller cases. Therefore, it's safe to apply it for n=9.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).
