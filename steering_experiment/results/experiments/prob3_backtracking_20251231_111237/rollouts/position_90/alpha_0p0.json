Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, it's manageable to compute each one. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that approach to see if I get the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution would be a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized that the entire expression is 3 times a_9, where a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(...), each subsequent term adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count how many times 1+3 appears. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3(...), there are 8 more layers: each time, a new 1+3(...). So that's 9 layers in total, right? Because starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1, then each layer wraps around the previous one, so up to layer 9. So, my computation of 9 layers is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me try a different approach to see if I get the same result. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, we can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also gives me 88572, which confirms my previous result. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the expression, it's similar to 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This can be represented as a sum of a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me try to express L_n in terms of a sum. From the recurrence relation, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which can be expanded as L_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n terms. So, expanding, L_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}. Wait, is that correct? Let me check for n=1: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. According to the sum, it would be 1 + 3^0 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is not matching. Hmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the recurrence relation solution since that worked. Alternatively, another approach is to realize that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, so the value grows exponentially. But since we've already solved it using the recurrence and verified it with step-by-step computation, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Let me just make sure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the step-by-step computation. Let me recompute each layer quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that all checks out. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": ". Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but given that it's only nine layers, maybe it's faster to compute each one. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*a, which can be represented recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, such that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Given f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), we can write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has solution f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution f_p(n) = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers inside the outermost 3. Wait, let me check: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. Wait, actually, in the expression, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So the outermost multiplication by 3 is after Layer 9. So Layer 9 is f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the total expression is 3*(f(9)) = 3*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So that's a good check. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, computing each layer step by step as I did initially also gives the same result, so that's reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a nested multiplication. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression. Let me try expanding the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous. This is a linear recurrence relation, and the solution can be found by recognizing that it's similar to a geometric progression but with an additive constant. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, and a particular solution would be a constant. Let me assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit different. However, the recurrence approach worked well. So, to recap: I broke down the expression into layers, computed each layer step by step, verified the pattern with a recurrence relation, found a closed-form formula, and confirmed the result. Each step built on the previous one, ensuring accuracy. It's a good reminder that even complex-looking expressions can often be simplified by breaking them down into manageable parts. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, as each step checked out, and the formula approach confirmed the result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence relation could give a closed-form formula, but since n is small (n=9), it's easier to compute step by step. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Substitute L_n = A*3^{n} + B, and L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B. So, A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate the terms: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. This might have saved time if the number of layers was larger, but for nine layers, both methods are manageable. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have led to the formula, avoiding repetitive computation. But in any case, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check my multiplication for 3*29524. 29524 *3: Let's compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Correct. So, yeah, I think I did everything right. Each step makes sense, and the formula corroborates the step-by-step computation.

Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Wait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(layer9). So, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. Let me see. Wait, in our earlier computation, layer9 was 29524, and then we multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2 is 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, perhaps we can express the entire expression as 3*a_9, where a_9 is as above. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the answer. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each nested term from the innermost parentheses outward.

For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Let's see: Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract B from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2 So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4: L(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^(10) -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.

So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is layer 9, and then we multiply by 3. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding each layer would give me a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to see that. Let me write out the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 +3 +9=13 Layer 3:1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, actually, Layer 2 is 1 +3*(Layer1)=1 +3*4=13, Layer3=1 +3*13=40, etc. Alternatively, if I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me try to expand this expression. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me expand this step by step:\n\nE =3*(1 +3*A), where A is the next layer: A=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))\n\nSimilarly, A=1 +3*B, where B=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))\n\nContinuing this way, each time we have 1 +3*(next layer). Since there are nine layers, the innermost is 1 +3, then each layer wraps around that.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each layer adds a power of 3, then the entire expression can be represented as a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by 3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, since each a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then E=3*a_9=88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer, and my step-by-step computation confirms it.

The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let me find D. Assume a particular solution is a constant D. Then substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => 0 = 1 + 2D => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.

Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step isn't too bad. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So each layer can be expressed as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. To find A and B, we can use the initial condition and the recurrence. Let's try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, assume the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nPlug into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, left side: A*3^{n} + B.\n\nRight side: A*3^{n} + 3B + 1.\n\nSet equal: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 3B + 1.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4.\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works. So, layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I didn't skip any steps, and I even derived a general formula for the layers, which helped confirm that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to check your work with a different method if possible, especially when dealing with repetitive patterns like this. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, recognizing a pattern that allows us to compute each layer using a recurrence relation. \n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for L9, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

So this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c can be found using the formula for the nth term. Here, k=3, c=1. The solution is a_n = (c/(1 - k)) + (a_0)*(k)^n. Wait, but in this case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so a_0 would be 1. Let me check. If n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0, so a_0 = 1. Then, the general formula would be a_n = (1)/(1 - 3) + (a_0)*(3)^n = (1)/(-2) + (1)*(3)^n = (3^n) - 1/2. Wait, that seems different from what I computed earlier. Let's see: For n=1, a_1 should be 4. Using the formula: (3^1) - 1/2 = 3 - 0.5 = 2.5, which is not 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recall the standard solution for linear recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, with a_0 given. The solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, that might be it. Let me test it. For our case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So k=3, c=1. The solution is a_n = 3^n * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Since a_0 = 1, this becomes a_n = 3^n + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplify: a_n = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent.

Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count: Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1. Then each subsequent 1+3 wraps around it, so each \"(\" adds a layer. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. So the innermost is 1+3, then each next is 1+3*(previous).

So, if I model this as a recurrence relation, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. Then, the number of layers here is 9, so a_9 would be the value of the innermost expression, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, solving this recurrence relation might give a formula, which could be faster for larger numbers of layers, but since we only have 9 layers, computing step by step is feasible. However, for practice, let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, to find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our case, with n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the innermost expression is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check my calculations to be sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, as I did before, digit by digit: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a function of the previous term. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, both methods, step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation, give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process continues until the outermost layer is reached. Using the recurrence relation, we find that the nth layer can be expressed as \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives \\(L_9 = 29524\\).

I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we can see that each term is defined recursively. Then, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. So, to find a_9, which is the innermost term, and then multiply by 3. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let's find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial terms are all positive integers, so maybe this approach isn't directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can solve it using homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = B*3^{n}. The particular solution, as we saw, is C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = B*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = B*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3B - 1/2 => 3B = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => B = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th layer: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Alternatively, I can check if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, maybe a geometric series or something else, but given that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, it's a linear recurrence relation.

The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3. So, the general solution would be a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nTo find A and B, we can use the initial condition and the recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's find B. As n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate unless A is zero. However, in our case, n is finite (up to 9), so we can still proceed.\n\nBut actually, since the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can solve it step by step as I did before, so maybe it's not necessary to go into the general solution here, especially since the number of layers is small (only 9).

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming if there are many layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), with n layers. In this case, n is 9. Let me see if there's a recursive formula or a closed-form solution. Let's denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, the recurrence relation would be: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2 = (3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute the final multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct.

    "text": ". Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about whether this sequence has a pattern. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can express this recursively and find a closed-form solution. The general form is Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Layer n = 3*(Layer n-1), which has the solution Layer n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Layer n = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: Layer 1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: Layer 2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be Layer 9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2, then 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*(Layer 9) = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, or applying the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same final answer of 88572. I think this is solid because multiple methods confirm the same result. So, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). By solving this recurrence, we find that each layer n can be expressed as (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For the given problem with 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could get tedious with so many layers. Let me think if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved here. Each layer seems to be following the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for the 9th layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's a more efficient way to compute it without going through each layer manually.

If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2= 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2= (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's another way to approach it, using recurrence relations. This method seems more efficient because it avoids computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods are manageable. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute the layers again more quickly: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524 Then 3*29524=88572.

And for n=0, perhaps, but since the expression starts at n=1, maybe n=0 isn't applicable. Alternatively, let's assume the recurrence is for n >=1, with a_1 =4. So, solving for A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume solution a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThen, using the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\nA*3^1 + B = 4 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.

For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula approach gives the same result as the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a formula that simplifies the computation. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might save time or reduce the chance of error. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, then L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each layer is indeed 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n, where n is the layer number. Let me consider the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can look for a pattern or find the homogeneous and particular solutions. Alternatively, since it's a simple linear recurrence, I can express it in terms of geometric series. Let me try expanding the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern. L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 9*4 = 1 + 3 + 36 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27*4 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 108 = 121 Hmm, I notice that each L_n can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. Let me write out L1 to L4 in terms of powers of 3: L1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1 L2 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 L3 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 L4 = 121 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 Wait, but 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 is 121? Let me compute that: 1 + 3 = 4, 4 + 9 = 13, 13 + 27 = 40, 40 + 81 = 121. Yes, that's correct. So, each L_n is the sum of the first n+1 powers of 3 starting from 3^0. So, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. But wait, that's the sum of a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series with ratio r \u2260 1 is (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). In this case, r = 3, so L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I've already computed. For L1: n=1, so (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches L1=4. For L2: n=2, (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches L2=13. For L3: n=3, (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches L3=40. For L4: n=4, (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which matches L4=121. Great, so this formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. I know that 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then we multiply that by 3, as the original expression is 3*(...). So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, writing it down: 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer follows the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.

Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me try to find a general formula for Ln. Let's define Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is when we set Ln = r*Ln-1, which gives r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let me check if Layer 9 is indeed (3^(10) - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Yes, that matches what I got earlier. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree, which gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Starting from the innermost layer, each term is multiplied by 3 each time we go outward. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand this, it might resemble a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try expanding it step by step. The innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, if I expand all the layers, it would look like: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me see how many terms there are. Each time we open a new layer, we add another 1 and multiply by 3. So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. As we saw earlier, this results in each layer being (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Therefore, for 9 layers, it's (3^10 - 1)/2, which is 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression as a sum: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Each layer adds a term that is 3^k, but perhaps I need to think more carefully. Wait, actually, when you expand the expression, each 1 inside the parentheses contributes to a term multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. Let me try to see this. Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. But perhaps this approach is complicating it. Alternatively, since I already have a formula for Ln, which is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, and I know that Layer 9 is (3^10 - 1)/2, then E = 3*Layer9 = 3*(3^10 - 1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it in multiple ways now, so I'm pretty confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Suppose I have an expression like x = 1 + 3x. Wait, but in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let x_n be the value of the nth layer, then x_{n} = 1 + 3*x_{n+1}. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for x_n in terms of n. Let me see the values I got: Layer 1: 4 = 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 I can see that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, x_{n} = 3*x_{n-1} + 1. Wait, but actually, looking at the layers, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps it's better to model it as x_{n} = 1 + 3*x_{n+1}, but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, if I reverse the order, starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from x1 = 4, x2 = 1 + 3*x1 = 1 + 12 = 13, x3 = 1 + 3*x2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, in general, x_{k} = 1 + 3*x_{k-1}, where x1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is x_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is x_k^{(h)} = C*3^{k}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution x_k^{(p)} = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is x_k = C*3^{k} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition x1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is x_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, x_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers I computed. For k=1: x1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: x2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: x3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: x4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer k, x_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, x9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, x9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*x9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since x9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*x9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*x9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, same result.

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. This looks like a geometric series or perhaps something that can be modeled with recursion. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n, that would allow me to compute the value for n=9 directly without computing each layer step by step. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, to find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation, we can assume a constant particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1). Let's assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1, which is reminiscent of a geometric series. But since the layers are nested, the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward. Another way to think about it is that each time we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, so it's similar to 3*(previous term +1). So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Wait, actually, let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The solution we found is correct, so I think I'm on the right track. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, recognizing a repeating pattern that can be modeled with a recurrence relation.\n\n1. **Define the layers**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the earlier result.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that can be generalized, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually seems feasible. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for n=1: a1=4. Using the formula: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9 corresponds to a9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3. So a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the final expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check with a different approach to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 =13. Next layer:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Next:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Next:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Next:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Next:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Next:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Next:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad. Alternatively, this might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Layer n is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40.

The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can compute it iteratively since there are only nine layers. Alternatively, I can note that each a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, for a_1 = 4. If n=1, then (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. Let me test that. For n=1: (3^2 - 3)/2 = (9 - 3)/2 = 6/2 = 3. Not 4. Hmm, not matching. Maybe I need to adjust the formula. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write out the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Which matches what I computed earlier. Now, to find a closed-form formula for a_n, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the inner expression evaluates to 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the closed-form formula, I could note that the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the number of layers. The original expression has 9 layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, yes, 9 layers, which we've computed from Layer 1 to Layer 9. Then multiplied by 3. So the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), computing each layer step by step is feasible. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k))*(k)^{n} + c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1. In this case, k = 3 and c = 1. So, plugging in, we get a_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3))*(3)^{n} + 1/(1 - 3). Let me compute that. First, 1 - 3 = -2, so 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Then, a_n = (4 - (-1/2))*(3)^n + (-1/2) = (4 + 1/2)*(3)^n - 1/2 = (9/2)*(3)^n - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^1 - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Wait, but earlier, Layer 1 was 4, not 13. Hmm, that suggests I might have misapplied the formula. Wait, perhaps the indexing is off. Because in the problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which would correspond to a_1 = 4. But according to the formula, when n=1, a_1 = 13. That doesn't match. So maybe my indexing is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. Let me try that. If a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, in this case, the general formula would be for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_0 = 1. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = ( (1) - c/(1 - k) ) * k^n + c/(1 - k). Wait, let me recall the standard solution for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_0 = 1: 1 = A*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = A - 1/2 => A = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=0: (3^{1} -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, correct. n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 40, correct. So, yes, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step.
