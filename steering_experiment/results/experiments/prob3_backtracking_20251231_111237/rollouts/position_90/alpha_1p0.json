    "text": " Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So yes, that's correct. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, another way to approach this might be to recognize that this is a geometric series or something similar, but given the structure, it's a linear recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me check if the pattern holds. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the closed-form expression. Let me see: The total expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute a few layers quickly. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Correct. Alternatively, if I were to write out the entire expression without parentheses, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). Each time, the innermost expression is computed first, so starting from the innermost 1+3, working outward. It's like a chain of multiplications and additions. Another way to think about it is that each time, you're adding 1 and then tripling it, which is similar to a geometric progression with a ratio of 3, but with an added 1 each time. So, each step is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which as we saw, leads to a closed-form solution. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3))...)), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or perhaps something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Wait, this seems to be the same as the layers I computed before. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The solution to this recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, how many layers do we have? Let's see: The original expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, up to a_9, which is the 9th layer. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check the formula again to make sure I applied it correctly. The formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where a_1 corresponds to the first layer. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is correct. And 3^{11} is indeed 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't recognize the pattern, I might have just computed each layer as I did before, which also gave me the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can recognize that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term.

So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, etc., as I computed. So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, perhaps we can find a general formula for L_n. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We can find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution, but perhaps it's easier to compute a few terms and find a pattern. Alternatively, let's compute the first few terms: L_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 L_2 = 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 L_3 = 3*13 + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40 L_4 = 3*40 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121 L_5 = 3*121 + 1 = 363 + 1 = 364 L_6 = 3*364 + 1 = 1092 + 1 = 1093 L_7 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3279 + 1 = 3280 L_8 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9840 + 1 = 9841 L_9 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29523 + 1 = 29524 So, as I computed before, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express this as a geometric series. Let me see. Let me write out L_1 to L_9 in terms of 3^n: L_1 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1\nL_2 = 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 3*(3 + 1) + 1 = 3^2 + 3 + 1\nL_3 = 3*13 + 1 = 3*(3^2 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\nHmm, so it seems like L_n = 3^n + 3^{n-1} + ... + 3 + 1. That's a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n. The sum of such a series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches L_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches L_3=40. So, yes, this formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, since we have 9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could express the entire original expression as 3 * L_9, where L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Also, since the recurrence is homogeneous with a constant term, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let me set L_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572, as before. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but since it's nested, it's more efficient to compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation.

Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Wait, no, actually, L(1) is 1 + 3, which is 4, then L(2) is 1 + 3*L(1), etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming L_p(n) = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. Good, so the formula seems correct. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.

    "text": ". Hmm, let me check the computation of each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120 + 3 = 123? Wait, no, 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. So 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: Let's break it down: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So I think that's correct. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. So, perhaps this is a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated step by step. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Wait, perhaps there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me check if the layers correspond to a known sequence or if there's a formula that can be applied. Let's see: Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 = 4 Layer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 13 Layer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1 = 40 Layer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1 = 121 Layer 5: 364 = 3*121 + 1 = 364 Layer 6: 1093 = 3*364 + 1 = 1093 Layer 7: 3280 = 3*1093 + 1 = 3280 Layer 8: 9841 = 3*3280 + 1 = 9841 Layer 9: 29524 = 3*9841 + 1 = 29524 So yes, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That seems consistent. So, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. If we have a recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4, then the solution can be found using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. Given a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, and a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 a_2 = 3*4 + 1 = 13 = 3^2 + 1 + 3 = 9 + 4 = 13 Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121, which matches a_4=121. So yes, it seems that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, layer n corresponds to a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier for layer 9. So that's consistent. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors when multiplying 29524 by 3. Breaking it down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572. Yep, that looks correct.\n\nAlternatively, to cross-verify, let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method. Let's break 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each calculation, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(Layer 9). So yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should check if I counted the layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost: Each time it's 1+3( something ). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, if I count the number of opening parentheses, it's 9, which would mean 9 layers, right? Let me check: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each time we have a 1+3*(...). So, each layer is one more 1+3*(...). So, starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)=1+12=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40, Layer4:1+3*40=121, Layer5:1+3*121=364, Layer6:1+3*364=1093, Layer7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, perhaps we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer is a_n. So, a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, which matches what I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that also gives the same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations.

So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is computed as such. So, this is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^n + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Therefore, C*3^n + D = C*3^n + 3D + 1. Subtracting C*3^n from both sides: D = 3D + 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, but let me check: Our initial layer was a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote a_n as the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see what this gives us. Let me write out the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Now, the problem is asking for 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe we can solve this recurrence relation more formally. The recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression inside is 29524, and then we multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me try to compute a few layers using the formula to see if it's consistent. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches. Similarly, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula seems solid. Therefore, the computation is correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": ". Alternatively, maybe I should compute it another way. Let me think about it as a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, let me compute a_1 to a_9: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, same result. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. Let me find C. Assume a particular solution is a constant, so a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, if I denote each layer as a term in a geometric series, perhaps I can find a pattern. But I think the recursive approach is clearer here. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in my calculations. Let me recompute a few layers to verify. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct. Alternatively, I can compute 3*29524 step by step: 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've double-checked my work enough times, and each step seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation.

Let's find A and B. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. When n=2, L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then plug A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the general term is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.

So, the number of layers is 9, as I thought before. So, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, in general, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation.

The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When k=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, k=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\n\nk=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which is correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.

    "text": ". Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^{n} + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Wait, but that formula is for when the recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, which is exactly our case. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. First, 3^{10} is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have expressed the entire expression as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2, which is 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, either way, the result is the same. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct, but just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers using the formula to see if they match. For example, Layer 5: (3^{6} - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Which matches what I had earlier. Similarly, Layer 7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. So, the formula is consistent, so using it for Layer 9 is valid. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer (n=9), this gives \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3))...)). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote a_n as the nth term, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recurrence? Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this method also confirms that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's actually a finite nested multiplication. Since it's finite, we can compute it step by step as we did before. Alternatively, if it were infinite, it would converge to a limit, but in this case, it's finite with nine layers. So, I think the step-by-step approach is the most straightforward way. Let me just recap the layers to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 Layer 3:1 +3*13=40 Layer 4:1 +3*40=121 Layer 5:1 +3*121=364 Layer 6:1 +3*364=1093 Layer 7:1 +3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1 +3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1 +3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572 Each step seems correct. Let me verify one of the middle layers, say Layer 5: Layer 4 is 121. 3*121=363. 1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364=1092. 1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:3*1093=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct.

I think that's it. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": ". Hmm, maybe I can think of another way to approach this. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this repeats nine times, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if I can apply this here. The initial condition is a_1 = 4, as we computed earlier. So, plugging into the general solution: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's substitute the general solution into the recurrence to find A and B. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Substitute a_n = A*3^n + B: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 3A + B = 4. Since B = -1/2, we have 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the same result, which confirms the answer is correct. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check if n=9 is correct. Because the innermost layer is a_1=4, then each subsequent layer up to a_9. So yes, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, so that's correct. Alternatively, if I consider that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 threes, then the number of layers is 9, so n=9. Therefore, using the formula, a_9= (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*a_9=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So expanding it, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). If I expand this, it becomes 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^k, where k is the number of layers. Wait, but in our case, the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost. Wait, let me see. If I have a_1=1 + 3, which is 1 + 3^1. Then a_2=1 + 3*a_1=1 + 3*(1 + 3)=1 + 3 + 3^2. Similarly, a_3=1 + 3*a_2=1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2)=1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So in general, a_n=1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... +3^n. Which is a geometric series with ratio 3, n+1 terms. So the sum would be (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct.

Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.

So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that also gives the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I've computed it step by step, checked each layer, and then used a formula to confirm.

    "text": ". Hmm, perhaps I can think of another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each layer is a_n. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This seems to be a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the expression as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3 each time, so perhaps there's a way to represent the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I let the entire inner expression be x, then x = 1 + 3x. Wait, but that's only if it's an infinite series, right? Because if it's finite, each layer has a specific depth. In this case, it's finite with 9 layers, so perhaps the geometric series approach isn't directly applicable here. Alternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 9, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I have a finite number of layers, say n layers, then the value at the nth layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, as before. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, as we found earlier. So, the expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 =177144. Then, 177144 /2 =88572. So that's another way to get the same result. That's reassuring. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same final answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next layer.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. This is similar to a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let's see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a constant particular solution. Let me find C. If a_n = C, then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Wait, but our initial terms are integers, so maybe this approach isn't the best. Alternatively, perhaps we can express it as a_n = (a_1 - C)*3^{n-1} + C. Let me test that. We have a_1 = 4, C = -1/2, so a_n = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2) = (4.5) * 3^{n-1} - 0.5. Let me check for n=1: 4.5 * 3^{0} - 0.5 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: 4.5 * 3^{1} - 0.5 = 13.5 - 0.5 = 13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: 4.5 * 3^{2} - 0.5 = 4.5*9 - 0.5 = 40.5 - 0.5 = 40, which matches a_3=40. Hmm, so this seems to work. So, the general term is a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that: For n=1, (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2, (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. For n=3, (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So yes, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without going through each layer manually, because if there are nine layers, that's a lot of computation. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 Hmm, so each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. So, perhaps I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n, then compute L9 and multiply by 3. Let's try that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L1 = 4. So: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since the original expression is 3*(L9), and L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, then a_{n} = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, left side: A*3^n + B. Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524.

So, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 4 times the previous term minus something. Let me see: L1 = 4 L2 = 13 = 4*3 + 1? Wait, 4*3=12, 12 +1=13. L3=40=13*3 +1=39 +1=40. L4=121=40*3 +1=120 +1=121. So, yes, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, the recurrence relation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, with L1=4. So, for n layers, the value would be... Hmm, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is solving Ln = 3Ln-1, which has solution Ln = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. So, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Wait, let me check for n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can see this as a geometric series with 9 terms. Wait, no, because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, so it's more like a geometric progression with each term being 3 times the previous plus 1. But I think the closed-form approach using the recurrence relation is the way to go here, and it gives me confidence that the step-by-step computation is correct. Therefore, I think the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the pattern Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, leading to the closed-form solution Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For 9 layers, this gives L9 = 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 yields the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth layer. Let's define L(n) as the value of layer n, where L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We know that L(1) = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous, the homogeneous solution is 3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me assume that the particular solution is a constant, say C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Wait, that can't be right because our layers are all positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the particular solution. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the method of solving linear recurrences. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say L_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: L(1) = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches Layer 2. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. So this formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^10 -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So that's correct.

Wait, but that's not correct because 29524 is 2*10000 + 9*1000 +5*100 +2*10 +4*1. So, 2*10000=20000, 9*1000=9000, 5*100=500, 2*10=20, 4*1=4. So, 20000 +9000=29000, +500=29500, +20=29520, +4=29524.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each layer step by step seems manageable. Let me check if there's a recursive formula or a geometric series involved. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then the total is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, this recurrence relation can be solved using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.

The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recursive relation. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for Ln. The recursive formula is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can recognize that it's a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L^p. Substituting into the recurrence: L^p = 1 + 3*L^p. Solving for L^p: L^p - 3*L^p = 1 => -2*L^p = 1 => L^p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be more efficient. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is a_1, then a_2 up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524=88572, which matches our earlier result. So, using the formula, we can see that the answer is 88572 without having to compute each layer manually, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since we had only 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Alternatively, if someone isn't familiar with recurrence relations, they might just compute each layer step by step, which is what I did initially. Either way, the result is the same. So, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a formula to find the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). The innermost term is 1 + 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Outer Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n4. **Formula Verification**: Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, each layer n can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Alternatively, perhaps the original expression has 8 layers? Wait, let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each time 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each time you go out, you add another layer. So how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: There are 9 closing parentheses after the initial 3(...). So that would mean 9 layers? Wait, no, because each 1+3(...) adds one layer, but the initial 3 is outside all of them. Let me think again. The structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with each innermost being 1+3. So the number of layers is equal to the number of times you have 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside the expression. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3. Then moving out, each time it's 1+3*(previous layer). So from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers? Wait, because the expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3. So the innermost is layer 1: 1+3. Then layer 2: 1+3*(layer 1). Layer 3: 1+3*(layer 2). Up to layer 9: 1+3*(layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So that's correct, 9 layers inside, each adding another 1+3*(...). So the computation I did earlier is correct, leading to 88572. Hmm, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error somewhere. Let's go through each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, multiply this by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute this carefully: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the correct way because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct. So the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can model this as a sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define a sequence a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, since we have 9 layers inside. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's another way to arrive at the same answer, using the closed-form formula. This confirms that my earlier step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.

The innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around. So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because after the initial 3(, there are 8 more layers. Wait, no, maybe 9 layers. Wait, let me count the number of times 1+3( occurs. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 1+3( is a new layer.

Because from the first 3(, then each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 of them. So, yes, 9 layers. So, my initial computation was correct with 9 layers, from Layer1 to Layer9. So, computing each layer as I did before, ending up with Layer9 = 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but I just want to make sure that when I computed Layer9, I didn't make a mistake. Let me recompute Layer9: Layer8 is 9841. So, Layer9 = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3=29523.

Wait, but that's not the correct breakdown because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.

    "text": " Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous). So the outermost layer would be a_9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost layer is 29524, and then we multiply by 3, giving 88572. So that seems consistent. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is effectively building a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this as such. Starting from the innermost term: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 Wait, that's 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Hmm, so each a_n is 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^{n} ?\n\nWait, let me check. a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\na_2 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\na_3 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\nSo yes, each a_n is the sum of a geometric series starting from 1 up to 3^n.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r = 3, so S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches our earlier formula. So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as we found before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't recognize the pattern, I could compute each layer step by step as I did earlier, which also gave me 29524, and then multiplying by 3 to get 88572.\n\nI think this is correct.

The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, let's assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. Therefore, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer's value. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the formula: 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see the values at each layer: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then multiply by 3: 88572. Hmm, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's more like a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can model this. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given that a_1 = 4, so plugging n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If we assume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B, then substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me check: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to see it. So, using the formula for the geometric series, we can find the sum without computing each layer individually. That's pretty neat. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we recognize a repeating pattern and compute each nested layer step by step.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Then 3*29524: 29524*3=88572, correct. So I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without doing each layer step by step. Let's see. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since the outermost layer is 3*a_9, let's compute a_9 first. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our previous result. So, using the formula, we can compute it without going through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, both methods work fine. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and work from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, yes, that's the same as before. Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't realize the recurrence, I could have noticed the pattern in the layers: Each a_n is 1 more than three times the previous. So, starting from 4, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. But regardless, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result.

Each one adds a new layer. So, that would mean 9 layers, each starting with 1+3*(previous layer). So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers. Therefore, the computation up to Layer 9 as 29524 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.

Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute each layer without manually computing each step, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually is manageable, though time-consuming. Using the formula is a better approach for more layers or for verification.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, step-by-step computation wasn't too bad. So, just to recap, the expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus three times the next term. By computing each layer from the inside out, I arrived at the innermost value of 4, then built each subsequent layer up to the ninth layer, which gave me 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to find a formula and compute the ninth term directly, which confirmed my step-by-step result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and build up to the outermost layer.

    "text": ". Hmm, alternatively, maybe I should think of this as a geometric series or something. Wait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's see: Let me define a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, is there a formula for a_n? Let me see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Assume a_n = D. Then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check once more with the step-by-step computation: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right.
