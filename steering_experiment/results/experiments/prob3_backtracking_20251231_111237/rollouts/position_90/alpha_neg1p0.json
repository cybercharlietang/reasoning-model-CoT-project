So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it directly, using the formula. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations.

Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which in this case is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + B, where B is a constant. Let's find B by setting a_n = B, then B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial term a_1 is 4, not a_0. Wait, let me check. Wait, in our problem, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4. So, perhaps the recurrence starts at n=1. Let me adjust the formula. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant. To find D, set a_n = D, so D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4, plug in n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 is (3^10 -1)/2, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Same result. So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.

    "text": ". Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to compute each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, etc., up to L9. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let's see. The recursive formula is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So general solution is Ln = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now apply initial condition. At n=1, L1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L9, would be (3^(10) -1)/2. Because n=9, so 3^(9+1)=3^10. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, expanding it all, the innermost is 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), which is 1 + 3 + 9, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27, and so on. So each layer adds another term which is 3^n. So, for Layer 9, it's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + ... + 3^8, because each layer adds one more power of 3. Wait, but in the recursive formula, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, let's see: L1=1 + 3 = 4 L2=1 + 3*(1 + 3)=1 + 3 + 9=13 L3=1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9)=1 + 3 + 9 + 27=40 So yes, each Ln is 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^n, but wait, actually, for L1, it's up to 3^1, for L2 up to 3^2, etc. So, in general, Ln = sum_{k=0}^n 3^k, but wait, no, because L1=4=1 + 3, which is sum_{k=0}^1 3^k=1 +3=4. Similarly, L2=1 + 3 + 9=13, which is sum_{k=0}^2 3^k=1 +3 +9=13. So, in general, Ln = sum_{k=0}^n 3^k. The sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^n r^k = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r -1). So, for r=3, sum_{k=0}^n 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula I found earlier. Therefore, Layer 9 is sum_{k=0}^9 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, that's another way to think about it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern of a geometric series.

Let me recall that for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). In this case, k=3, c=1. So, the solution would be a_n = (4 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1) = (4 + 0.5) * 3^{n-1} - 0.5 = 4.5 * 3^{n-1} - 0.5. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = 4.5 * 3^{0} - 0.5 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4. Correct. n=2: 4.5 * 3^{1} - 0.5 = 13.5 - 0.5 = 13. Correct. n=3: 4.5 * 9 - 0.5 = 40.5 - 0.5 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = 4.5 * 3^{8} - 0.5.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, step-by-step computation is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something similar, but given that each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's more like a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give a formula for a_n, which could then be used to compute a_9 directly. Let me try that approach to verify. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572.

Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. For n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = (3*59048)/2. Let me compute 59048 /2 =29524, then 29524*3=88572, same as before. So, either way, the result is the same. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That is, each layer can be represented recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... and so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step, which would save time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. I think I've got the correct answer here, 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to be sure. So, using the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

It saves a lot of time instead of computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula to check. For example, a_1 should be (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121.

The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9, and then the total is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the formula, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. But in this case, since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step was manageable. But for a larger number of layers, the formula would be more efficient. Anyway, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.

Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Then, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.

The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's find another equation. Let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 3*L_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13. Using the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 13 = 9A + B. Now we have a system of equations: 4 = 3A + B 13 = 9A + B Subtracting the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now plug A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers we computed. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, matches L_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, L_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, L_3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, L_4=121. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Therefore, the total expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Let's see what the general formula is for such a recursive expression. If I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B. To find A and B, we can solve the recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it step by step again, just to catch any possible arithmetic errors. Let me do that. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the calculations. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Layer 6: 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: Let me compute it again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, 2*3=6+1=7, 5*3=15, 9*3=27+1=28, 2*3=6+2=8. So 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, let me check that: 30000 * 3 = 90000. 476 * 3 = 1428. So 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, same result. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, which is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts from 1 at the innermost. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. We have a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 =4, and we have 9 layers. So the outermost layer is a_9. Let me compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can directly compute a_9 as (3^{10}-1)/2, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.

The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursion. Let me think if there's a pattern here. Let me define each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recursive formula. If I can find a closed-form expression for a_n, maybe I can compute a_9 without computing each step. Let's try to find a pattern or a formula. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write out the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with a_1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. a_2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. a_3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which is correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, we can compute it as (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, let's see if we can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10 = 59049, so 3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result.

The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me consider a general case where we have n layers. Let\u2019s denote the value at each layer as a_i, where i is the layer number from 1 to n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 ... and so on, up to a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the total expression is 3*a_n. So, for n=9, we have 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Suppose a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, a_n = A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Comparing both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, let's find A using the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value we got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we also get 88572. That\u2019s reassuring. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was unsure, computing each layer step by step was a good approach to ensure accuracy. Another way to think about this is to consider that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 1, each step is 1 + 3*previous. But since we have nine layers, it's just a matter of applying this operation nine times. Let me try to write out the steps again with the formula: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*a_9 = 88572.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me denote L1 = 1 + 3 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 ... and so on up to L9. Then, the total expression is 3*L9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for Ln in terms of n. Let me see. Let's consider the recurrence relation: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say Lp. Plugging into the recurrence: Lp = 3*Lp + 1. Solving for Lp: Lp - 3*Lp = 1 => -2*Lp = 1 => Lp = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. Plugging n=1: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Let me assume the particular solution is B, then substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Then, using the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer.

Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me consider the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution would be a_n = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. So, starting from L_1=4, each subsequent L is 1 + 3*previous. So, this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous with constant coefficients. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.

So, Layer 8 is 9841. 3 * 9841: Let's compute that. 9841 * 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, 9841 *3: 3, then 12: write 2, carry 1. Then 24 +1=25: write 5, carry 2.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually computing each layer, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable. But just for fun, let me see if there's a pattern here. Looking at the layers: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Hmm, I notice that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each term can be expressed recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * (a_0 + d/(c - 1)) - d/(c - 1). Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be computed as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers using both methods to see if they align. Let's take Layer 4: Using the step-by-step, Layer 4 was 121. Using the formula, a_4 = (3^{5} -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Layer 5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, everything lines up.

Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4. Wait, no. Wait, L1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, etc. So each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. We have L1 = 4, L2 = 13, L3 = 40, etc. Let me write the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = D, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial conditions. Let's take n=1: L1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So for Layer 9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer9 = 3 *29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the first few layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute 3*29524: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. So, I think that's solid.

Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3(...) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on, up to 9 layers. So, yes, layer 9 is the outermost one, and then multiplied by 3. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula to compute it without expanding each layer. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. So, each Li = 1 + 3*Li-1, with L1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: Li = 1 + 3*Li-1. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for Li. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is Li = A*3^i + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug into the recurrence: Li = 1 + 3*Li-1 => A*3^i + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(i-1) + B) = 1 + A*3^i + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^i + B = 1 + A*3^i + 3B. Subtract A*3^i from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L1 = 4. When i=1, L1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Li = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^(i+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(i+1) - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for i=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For i=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For i=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for i=9, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2. Because Li = (3^(i+1) -1)/2, so when i=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, using the method for solving linear recursions. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with our earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, Layer1=4.

Since the expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.

The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives the same result as computing each layer step by step. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this way, after expanding all layers, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_1.\n\nWait, but a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3, so a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, if we expand a_n, it's a sum of a geometric series plus 3^n*a_1.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me try expanding a_2:\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nSo, each a_n is the sum of a geometric series up to 3^{n-1}, plus 3^n*a_1.\n\nWait, but a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3, so 3^1 + 1.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is better. Let me consider the expansion:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) )\n\nSo, each a_n can be written as a sum: 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n+1}*(initial term). But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we derived earlier, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods\u2014the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. It's 9 layers deep, so I think I did 9 layers correctly. So, Layer 1: innermost 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 up to Layer 9, each time 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then multiply the final result by 3. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. This seems like a geometric series or something. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B. Assume a_n = B for all n. Then, B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial condition is a_1 = 4. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is -1/2. So, a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.
