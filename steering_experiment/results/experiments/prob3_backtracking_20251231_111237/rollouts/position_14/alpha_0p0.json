    "text": " Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say:\n\n- Let\u2019s denote the innermost expression as A\u2081 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081.\n\nThen A\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082.\n\nAnd so on, up to A\u2089, since there are nine layers. Finally, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe it's better to think of each layer as starting with 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(innermost result) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute 3*4: 12. Then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13: 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40.\n\nCompute 3*40: 120. Then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121.\n\nCompute 3*121: 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364.\n\nCompute 3*364: 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute 3*1093: Let's see, 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000 + 840 = 3840. Then 1 + 3840 = 3841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3841.\n\nCompute 3*3841: Let's break it down: 3000*3=9000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 9000 + 2400 = 11400; 11400 + 120 = 11520; 11520 + 3 = 11523. Then 1 + 11523 = 11524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*11524.\n\nCompute 3*11524: Let's do 10000*3=30000, 1500*3=4500, 24*3=72. Adding those: 30000 + 4500 = 34500; 34500 + 72 = 34572. Then 1 + 34572 = 34573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(34573).\n\nCompute 3*34573: Let's break it down. 30000*3=90000, 4000*3=12000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Now add them up: 90000 + 12000 = 102000; 102000 + 1500 = 103500; 103500 + 210 = 103710; 103710 + 9 = 103719.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 34573 * 3: 3*3=9, 3*7=21, 3*5=15, 3*4=12, 3*3=9. So writing it out:\n\n34573\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n9 (3*3)\n21 (3*7) but carry over 2, so 1 and carry 2\n15 + 2 = 17 (3*5 + 2)\n12 (3*4)\n9 (3*3)\nSo writing it down:\n\n3*3=9\n\n3*7=21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*5=15 + 2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*4=12 +1=13, write down 3, carry over 1.\n\n3*3=9 +1=10, write down 0, carry over 1. But since there are no more digits, write 10.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting with my previous calculation. Let me do it step by step:\n\n34573 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\n3 \u00d7 7 = 21, write 1, carry 2.\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write 3, carry 1.\n\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9 + 1 = 10, write 0, carry 1. Since there are no more digits, write the 1.\n\nSo the result is 103719.\n\nWait, but when I did the other way, I thought it was 103719, which matches. So that seems correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 103,719.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount each layer:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841? Wait, hold on, earlier I thought 3*3280 was 9840, but when I computed it earlier, I thought it was 3840. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 3280 \u00d7 3: 3000\u00d73=9000, 200\u00d73=600, 80\u00d73=240, 0\u00d73=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. But earlier, I had 3280 \u00d7 3 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought it was 3280 \u00d7 3 = 9840, but in my step-by-step, I had a different number. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step, after 3280, I had:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000\u00d73=9000, 200\u00d73=600, 80\u00d73=240, 0\u00d73=0. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nBut earlier, in my initial calculation, I thought 3*3280 was 9840, but in my first pass, I had 3*3280 as 3840, which is wrong. Wait, that was a mistake. So let me correct that.\n\nSo, starting over from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought the next layer was 1 + 3*3841, which was incorrect. So I think I made a mistake in the layer count. Let me recount the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So how many times does 1+3 appear?\n\nLet me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the outermost. So how many layers? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So from the innermost, there are 9 layers because the expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, but when I started, I thought the innermost was 1+3, then each layer adds another, so the total layers would be 9. So let me try again, carefully.\n\nLet me list each layer step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the result was 103,719, which was wrong because I miscounted the layers. So now, with 9 layers, the final result is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me confirm this by another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had 9 layers, I ended up with 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nBut in my initial calculation, I thought there were 9 layers, but I miscounted and ended up with a higher number.\n\nWait, so to clarify, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost 1+3, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...) terms.\n\nEach time you see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So when I compute up to Layer 9, I get 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought I had 9 layers, I was getting 34573 as the Layer 9 result, which was incorrect because I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"(\" after the initial 3 adds a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the first \"(\" after 3: that's the first layer.\n\nThen each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the initial 3: (1+3(...)) \u2192 1\n\n2. Next \"(\" inside: (1+3(...)) \u2192 2\n\n3. Next: 3 \u2192 3\n\n4. Next: 3 \u2192 4\n\n5. Next: 3 \u2192 5\n\n6. Next: 3 \u2192 6\n\n7. Next: 3 \u2192 7\n\n8. Next: 3 \u2192 8\n\n9. Next: 3 \u2192 9\n\n10. Next: 3 \u2192 10\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me write it with indices to count the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo that's 9 layers inside, plus the outermost 3*(...). So total layers inside are 9, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then 3*29524=88,572.\n\nBut earlier, I thought I had 9 layers, but I miscounted and thought the innermost was 1+3, then each layer adds one, but I actually have 9 layers, so the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p \u21d2 a_p - 3*a_p = 1 \u21d2 -2*a_p = 1 \u21d2 a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing step by step, I thought I had 9 layers, but I was getting a different result. It seems that using the recurrence relation gives me a clear path and confirms that the result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence gives us the value of the innermost expression and each subsequent layer until the final result is obtained.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. This can be modeled as a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence relation**: Define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4 (the innermost expression).\n\n3. **Solve the recurrence**: The solution to the recurrence is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute for n=9**: Since there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3, compute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's say the innermost expression is Layer 1, then the next one out is Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up to the final answer. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 That was easy. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, getting bigger. Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute that: Total = 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, the total is 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. So, 29524 *3 is indeed 88572. Okay, so that seems correct. Let me just go through each layer again quickly to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any step.

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end. So, the final result will be 3 times the value of Layer 9. Let me try to compute Layer 1 first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 equals 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, that seems like a big number. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think my final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each nested expression from the innermost layer outward.

    "text": " Let me assign variables to each nested expression to keep track. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- Let\u2019s call the innermost expression E1: 1 + 3\n- Then the next one out is E2: 1 + 3(E1)\n- Then E3: 1 + 3(E2)\n- And so on, up to E9: 1 + 3(E8)\n\nBut wait, actually, looking at the original problem, the innermost part is 1 + 3, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen moving one layer out:\nE2 = 1 + 3(E1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\nE3 = 1 + 3(E2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait a minute, this seems to be growing quickly. Let me check that again. So, E1 is 4, then E2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then E3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, that's correct. Let me continue this way.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3(E3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3(E4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3(E5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3(E6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3(E7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3(E8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3 times (E9). So, the entire expression is 3*E9. So, E9 is 29524, so 3*29524 would be the final answer.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\nWait, wait, that might be a mistake because I think I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly.\n\nActually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 (tens place) * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n5 (hundreds place) * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 (thousands place) * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 (ten thousands place) * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 87572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0\n\nSo, writing it out: 87572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 = 87572.\n\nBut let me verify this because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute E9 correctly first.\n\nWait, let me check each E step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nStarting again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, E9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3*29524 is 87572, but let me verify that multiplication again.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from the previous result. Oh no, I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, so using this method, 29524*3 is 88572, not 87572 as I thought before. So, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nWait, let's compute 29524*3 again step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0.\n\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But when I broke it down, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Hmm, that means I made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, let's check the breakdown again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 *3 = 60000\n\n9000 *3 = 27000\n\n500 *3 = 1500\n\n20 *3 = 60\n\n4 *3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 29524 *3 should be the same regardless of the method. So, where's the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the digit places. Let me write 29524 as:\n\n2 (ten thousands place)\n\n9 (thousands)\n\n5 (hundreds)\n\n2 (tens)\n\n4 (units)\n\nSo, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding these:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nBut when I did the digit-wise multiplication, I got 87572.\n\nWait, that's a problem. There must be a mistake in one of the methods. Let me try another approach. Let's compute 29524 *3 using the standard multiplication method.\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\n\u00d7         3\n------------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nWait, but in the breakdown method, I got 88572. So, that means I must have made a mistake in the breakdown method. Let me check the breakdown again.\n\nWait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, 20000 + 9000 = 29000, not 87000. Wait, no, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, so 60000 + 27000 is 87000.\n\nThen, 87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the digit-wise multiplication. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-wise multiplication. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 7 5 7 2 \u2192 87572.\n\nWait, but in the breakdown, I have 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be. There's a mistake somewhere. Let me use another method to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet me add:\n\n29524\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 +5 =10, write 0, carry 1\n\n9 +9 =18 +1=19, write 9, carry 1\n\n2 +2=4 +1=5\n\nSo, 29524 +29524=59048.\n\nNow, add another 29524:\n\n59048 +29524.\n\nLet me add:\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 +4=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n4 +2=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0\n\n0 +5=5 \u21925, carry 0\n\n9 +9=18 \u21928, carry 1\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8 \u21928, carry 0\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, so that's different from the digit-wise multiplication. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572, but when I did the digit-wise multiplication, I got 87572.\n\nWait, that means I must have made a mistake in the digit-wise multiplication.\n\nWait, let me try digit-wise multiplication again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 7 5 7 2 \u2192 87572.\n\nBut when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572.\n\nWait, so which one is correct? Let me check with another method.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition method.\n\nLet me try adding 29524 + 29524 + 29524 again.\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524:\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n4 +4=8\n\n2 +2=4\n\n5 +5=10 \u2192 0, carry 1\n\n9 +9=18 +1=19 \u21929, carry 1\n\n2 +2=4 +1=5\n\nSo, 29524 +29524=59048.\n\nNow, 59048 +29524:\n\nAdding digit by digit:\n\n8 +4=12 \u21922, carry1\n\n4 +2=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry0\n\n0 +5=5 \u21925, carry0\n\n9 +9=18 \u21928, carry1\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8 \u21928, carry0\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's consistent. So, why does the digit-wise multiplication give me 87572? There must be a mistake in how I'm performing the digit-wise multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7       3\n   -----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n\nNext digit:5*3=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit:9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nBut when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check using a calculator if possible, but since I can't use one, maybe I can compute 29524 *3 in another way.\n\nWait, 29524 *3: Let's compute 29524 *3 as (30000 - 476) *3 = 30000*3 - 476*3.\n\n30000*3=90000\n\n476*3=1428\n\nSo, 90000 - 1428= 88572.\n\nAh, there we go. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as when I added 29524 three times. So, that means the digit-wise multiplication was wrong.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong in the digit-wise multiplication? Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write 29524 as:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nSo, when multiplied by 3, it should be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the other methods. Wait, perhaps I'm misaligning the digits. Let me write it as:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7       3\n   -----------\n       8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, but when I do it as 29524 *3, the correct result is 88572, as shown by the addition method and the alternative multiplication method.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-wise multiplication by not considering that 9*3 is 27, but when adding the carry, it's 28, so we write 8 and carry 2. Then, the next digit is 2 (ten thousands place) which is multiplied by 3 to get 6, plus the carryover 2, making 8. So, the result should be 8 (ten thousands place), 8 (thousands place), 5 (hundreds place), 7 (tens place), 2 (units place). Wait, that would make it 88572, not 87572.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when we multiply each digit by 3:\n\n- 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0\n- 5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo, writing it from left to right: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 88572. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 87572. Probably, I miswrote the digits.\n\nWait, so the correct result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-wise multiplication, I thought it was 87572, but that must have been a mistake. The correct result is 88572.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is 3*(E9), where E9=29524. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing E1 through E9.\n\nE1=1+3=4.\n\nE2=1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nE3=1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nE4=1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nE5=1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nE6=1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nE7=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nE8=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nE9=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nSo, E9=29524.\n\nThen, 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Let me denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, E3, up to E9, where each E is 1 + 3*(next E). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\n...\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and each time, inside the parentheses, it's another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, each followed by 1 + 3(...). So, there are nine layers, meaning E1 to E9, each defined as above. So, E1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then E2 is 1 + 3*E1, and so on, up to E9, which is the outermost layer, and then the entire expression is 3*E9. So, I need to compute E1 through E9 step by step. Let me start computing each E.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, moving on. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so E3 is 40. Now, E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE4 is 121. Next, E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE5 is 364. Now, E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE6 is 1093. Moving on to E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE7 is 3280. Next, E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE8 is 9841. Now, finally, E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, E9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 29524*3: 29524*3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my computations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting from E1 to E9:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from E1, each E is 1 + 3*E_prev.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for E_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, E1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: E4=(3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

So, if I compute E1 through E9 step by step, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me write this down step by step. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that was simple. Now, moving to E2: E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, that's 13. Next, E3: E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 So, E3 is 40. Now, E4: E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, E4 is 121. Moving on to E5: E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 E5 is 364. Next, E6: E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 E6 is 1093. Now, E7: E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 E7 is 3280. Continuing to E8: E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 E8 is 9841. Finally, E9: E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 E9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, so let's compute that: 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3.

So, E9 = 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward. Now, E8 = 1 + 3*E9 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, E8 = 13. Moving outward, E7 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13 first: 3*10 is 30, plus 3*3 is 9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, E7 = 40. Next, E6 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, E6 = 121. Moving outward again, E5 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, E5 = 364. Next, E4 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, E4 = 1093. Moving outward, E3 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Well, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, adding those together: 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, E3 = 3280. Next, E2 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, E2 = 9841. Finally, E1 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, E1 = 29524. But wait, the original problem is 3*(E1). Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*E1. So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just quickly verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost, E9=4, E8=13, E7=40, E6=121, E5=364, E4=1093, E3=3280, E2=9841, E1=29524, then 3*E1=88572. Each step seems to follow: each E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n+1). I think that's correct. Let me check a couple of the multiplications to be sure. For example, 3*121: 121*3. 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3. 300+60=360, +3=363. Then, 1 + 363=364. That's correct. Another one: 3*1093. 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. And 3*3280. 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Then, 3*9841. 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. That seems right. So, I think I did it correctly. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " Let me denote the innermost expression as Layer 1, then Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1). Layer 3 is 3*(1 + Layer 2), and so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Wait, actually, since the outermost expression is 3*(...), maybe the layers go from 1 to 9, with each layer being 3*(1 + previous layer). Hmm, perhaps I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let's try that approach. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that: 1 + 4 = 5, and then 3*5 = 15. So, Layer 2 is 15. Next, moving out another layer, we have 3*(1 + Layer 2). Layer 2 is 15, so this is 3*(1 + 15). 1 + 15 = 16, and 3*16 = 48. So, Layer 3 is 48. Continuing this process, Layer 4 would be 3*(1 + 48). Let's compute that: 1 + 48 = 49, then 3*49 = 147. Layer 4 is 147. Layer 5 is 3*(1 + 147). 1 + 147 = 148, 3*148 = 444. So, Layer 5 is 444. Moving on to Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444). 1 + 444 = 445, 3*445. Hmm, let me compute that. 400*3=1200, 45*3=135, so 1200+135=1335. So, Layer 6 is 1335. Layer 7 is 3*(1 + 1335). 1 + 1335 = 1336, 3*1336. Let me compute 1336*3. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So, 3000 + 900 = 3900, 3900 + 90 = 3990, 3990 + 18 = 4008. So, Layer 7 is 4008. Layer 8 is 3*(1 + 4008). 1 + 4008 = 4009, then 3*4009. Let me calculate that. 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so 12000 + 27 = 12027. So, Layer 8 is 12027. Finally, Layer 9 is the outermost expression, which is 3*(1 + 12027). Let me compute that. 1 + 12027 = 12028, then 3*12028. Hmm, 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so 36000 + 84 = 36084. Therefore, Layer 9 is 36084. So, the entire expression simplifies to 36084. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct. So, each layer seems to compute correctly. Therefore, the final result is 36084. I think that's the right answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helps prevent mistakes. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer individually, but since it's only nine layers, doing it manually isn't too bad. I wonder if this expression can be generalized or if it's a specific case of a more general formula. For example, if I have an expression like 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...(1 + 3)...))), with n layers, is there a closed-form formula for that? Maybe, but for this problem, since n is 9, computing each layer was manageable. I think I'm confident with the answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is calculated as 3 times (1 plus the result of the previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is found to be 36084.\n\n$\\boxed{36084}$"

    "text": " Let me denote each innermost expression as follows: Let\u2019s define E1 = 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Then E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9, which would be the entire expression inside the first set of parentheses, and then the whole thing multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is 1 + 3*(E8), and so on. So, perhaps I should work from the inside out, computing each Ei step by step. Let me try that. Let's start with the innermost expression, which is E1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's jumping up quickly. Next, E5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 121, so E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6. E6 is 1093, so E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7. E7 is 3280, so E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, E9 = 1 + 3*E8. E8 is 9841, so E9 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841. Well, 9841 times 3. Let me do that step by step. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, and 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.

So, the entire expression is 3*E9. That seems manageable. So, if I can compute E1 through E9 step by step, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me start calculating each E from the inside out. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving outward to E2: E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so E2 is 13. Next, E3: E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so E3 is 40. Let's go on to E4: E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E4 is 121. Now, E5: E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E5 is 364. Next, E6: E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, E6 is 1093. Moving on to E7: E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, E7 is 3280. Now, E8: E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. E8 is 9841. Finally, E9: E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000; 3*9000 is 27000; 3*500 is 1500; 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that multiplication another way to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n---------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers, let me go through the layers again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 12 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 + 39=40\n\nLayer4:1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+29523=29524\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here, perhaps a geometric series or something, but given the time constraints, breaking it down step by step seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I have an expression like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), it's a recursive expression where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps, but since I only have nine layers, computing each step is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for a_n can be expressed as a geometric series.\n\nLet me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1) + a_0*r^{n}, but I might be misremembering.\n\nWait, actually, for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n}*a_0 + c*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1).\n\nIn our case, a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nSo, in this case, r=3, c=1.\n\nThe general solution would be a_n = 3^{n}*a_0 + 1*(3^{n} -1)/(3 -1).\n\nBut wait, our initial condition is a_1 =4, which is when n=1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for n layers, starting from a_1, which is 1+3=4.\n\nThen, a_2 =1 +3*a_1 =1 +3*4=13.\n\nSimilarly, a_3=1 +3*a_2=40, etc.\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution for a_n would be a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 + 2.\n\nWait, let me test that.\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 +2 = (3-1)/2 +2= 1 +2=3, but a_1=4. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach.\n\nLet me write the recurrence as a_n =3*a_{n-1} +1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B =3*B +1 => B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\n(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, a_1=4.\n\nFor n=2:\n\n(3^{3} -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, a_2=13.\n\nn=3:\n\n(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40.\n\nn=4:\n\n(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, a_4=121.\n\nn=5:\n\n(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, a_5=364.\n\nn=6:\n\n(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct, a_6=1093.\n\nn=7:\n\n(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct, a_7=3280.\n\nn=8:\n\n(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct, a_8=9841.\n\nn=9:\n\n(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, a_9=29524.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution. That's probably a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger, but for nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead to the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost one: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3(Layer2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Moving on to Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so Layer3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer4 is 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then Layer6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then Layer7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then Layer8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. So Layer9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: I can break it down as 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So the number is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. So the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just go through each step again quickly to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from Layer1: 1+3=4. Layer2: 1+3*4=13. Layer3: 1+3*13=40. Layer4: 1+3*40=121. Layer5: 1+3*121=364. Layer6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It's a geometric series perhaps? Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, assuming r \u2260 1. Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - r*a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n = A*r^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = c + r*B. Solving for B: B - r*B = c => B*(1 - r) = c => B = c/(1 - r). So the general solution is a_n = A*r^{n} + c/(1 - r). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's see: a_1 = A*r + c/(1 - r). Here, c is 1, r is 3, so a_1 = 4 = A*3 + 1/(1 - 3) = 3A + 1/(-2) = 3A - 1/2. So, 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} + 1/(1 - 3) = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. Simplifying, that's (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For Layer1, n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. Layer2, n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. Layer3, n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Layer4, n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. Layer5, n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. Layer6, n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. Layer7, n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. Layer8, n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. Layer9, n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which simplifies the computation. Applying this formula to the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, E3:\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, E3 is 40. Let's keep going.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, so E9 is 29524. But remember, the entire expression is 3 times E9, right? Because the original problem is 3*(...). So, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, that gives us 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when I do mental math, I might make an error. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 another way.\n\n29,524 * 3 can be broken down as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 476*3.\n\nCompute 476*3: 400*3=1,200; 70*3=210; 6*3=18. So, 1,200 + 210 = 1,410 + 18 = 1,428.\n\nSo, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all my steps because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a calculation mistake. Let me go through each E step again.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically, and the calculations seem accurate. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Maybe recognizing that each E is part of a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expressions:\n\nE1 = 4\n\nE2 = 13\n\nE3 = 40\n\nE4 = 121\n\nE5 = 364\n\nE6 = 1,093\n\nE7 = 3,280\n\nE8 = 9,841\n\nE9 = 29,524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each E is roughly 3 times the previous E plus 1. So, E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1). That's the recurrence relation here.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and such sequences can often be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E(n) = 3*E(n-1), which has the solution E(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say E_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nE_p = 1 + 3*E_p\n\nSolving for E_p:\n\nE_p - 3*E_p = 1\n\n-2*E_p = 1\n\nE_p = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E(n) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, E(1) = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n4.5 = 3C\n\nC = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5\n\nSo, C = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, E(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nE(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nE(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nE(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nE(4)=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nE(5)=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nE(6)=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1,093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nE(7)=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3,280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\nE(8)=(3^9 -1)/2=(19,683 -1)/2=19,682/2=9,841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\nE(9)=(3^10 -1)/2=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Correct.\n\nWow, so the formula works perfectly. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have directly used this formula for E(n) where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, E(9) = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29,524 as computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E(9) = 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nThis alternative method using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's a good reminder of how recognizing patterns and applying mathematical concepts can simplify problem-solving.\n\nBut in this case, since the number of layers isn't too large, both methods work. The step-by-step computation is straightforward and ensures accuracy by verifying each small part, while the formula provides a quick way to compute the result once the pattern is recognized.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), leading to a closed-form solution E(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Applying this for n=9 gives E(9)=29,524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, if I compute each layer step by step, it might be manageable. Let me try that approach. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364.

Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so the final computation is: Final Answer = 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 3 times 29524. Let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6. So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it as (29500 + 24) * 3 = 29500*3 + 24*3. 29500*3: 29,500 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,500*3=28,500. So 60,000 + 28,500 = 88,500. 24*3=72. So 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same as before. So the final answer is indeed 88,572. Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers, let me quickly go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

So I think I did this correctly. It's a bit tedious, but by breaking it down layer by layer, it's manageable. I was worried at first that it might be too complicated, but once I started working through each step, it wasn't so bad. I just need to be careful with each multiplication and addition to avoid any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers towards the end.

Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving to Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. Therefore, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives us 121. So, Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Therefore, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093. So, 3*1093 is... let's compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is... 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... let's compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Therefore, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12.

Each time, it's 1 + 3*something, and the something is the next layer. So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let's see. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this formula applies correctly. Since a_n is defined as the nth layer, starting from a_1 = 4, which is the innermost. So, in the problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9, so a_9 is the innermost? Wait, no, actually, in my earlier approach, a_1 was the innermost, so a_9 would be the outermost. Wait, no, actually, no. Let me think again. Wait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the innermost is (1+3), which is a_1 = 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*a_1, which is a_2 = 13, and so on, up to a_9, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3. So, the expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this using another approach to be absolutely sure. Let's compute each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me denote the innermost part as Layer 1, then moving outward as Layer 2, Layer 3, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is (1 + 3), Layer 2 is 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + Layer 2, and so on. Wait, maybe I should write this more clearly. Let me define each layer step by step. Let's start from the innermost expression: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12. Layer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39. Layer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120. Layer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363. Layer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 1 + 363 = 364. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So, is the answer 1092? Wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(4) = 12.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(13) = 39.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(40) = 120.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(121) = 363.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nOutermost: 3*(364) = 1092.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify each step again because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate.\n\nStarting over:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 3*121 = 363. Let me compute 3*120 = 360, plus 3*1 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n10. Finally, 3*364. Let me compute this again. 364 * 3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to confirm the answer. Let's see, the expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. So, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize that each layer is following a pattern where each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, let's think recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, so f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, for n=1: f(1) = 4.\n\nn=2: f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Wait, but earlier I calculated Layer 2 as 12. Hmm, that's different. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the layers. Let me check.\n\nWait, in my initial approach, Layer 1 was 1 + 3 = 4, Layer 2 was 3*(4) = 12, Layer 3 was 1 + 12 = 13, etc. But if I model f(n) as 3*(1 + f(n-1)), then f(1) would be 3*(1 + f(0)), but f(0) might be 1? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe the function f(n) is defined as the value after n layers. So, for example, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost layer is 3*(f(9)), but perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Wait, no, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers inside. So maybe the function f(n) is the inner expression, and the total expression is 3*f(n). Let me see.\n\nWait, let's try to model this correctly. Let me think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with a total of nine layers. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, for n layers, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. So, perhaps f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed manually, I got f(2) as 12, f(3) as 13, etc. So, perhaps I'm not modeling this correctly. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the function f(n) is defined as the value of the expression with n layers, starting from the innermost. So, for n=1, it's (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nFor n=2, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nFor n=3, it's 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but that's different from my initial computation where I had Layer 3 as 13. Hmm, that's a problem. It seems I'm getting conflicting results. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, let me clarify the structure. The problem is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Wait, so perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer 3 is 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer 4 is 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer 5 is 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer 6 is 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer 7 is 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer 8 is 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer 9 is 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, that's a very different result than my initial 1092. So, now I'm confused because my two methods are giving me different answers. Clearly, I'm making a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem. The problem is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3.\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nSo, each \"3(\" starts a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's nine \"3(\" expressions, so nine layers. So, perhaps in my first approach, I was counting from the innermost as Layer1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, in that case, Layer1 is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought the innermost was Layer1, then each Layer2 was 3*(Layer1), then Layer3 was 1 + Layer2, etc., which gave me 1092. But now, using this recursive function approach, I'm getting 108252, which is way larger.\n\nThis suggests that I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nIn my initial approach, I started with Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(4) = 12.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer4: 3*(13) = 39.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer6: 3*(40) = 120.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer8: 3*(121) = 363.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, 3*(364) = 1092.\n\nBut according to the recursive function approach, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from Layer1 as 4, Layer2 as 15, Layer3 as 48, etc., leading to Layer9 as 36084, and the total expression as 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nSo, where is the discrepancy?\n\nI think the issue is in how I'm defining the layers. In the problem, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Therefore, if I have n layers, the value would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I was alternating between adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which might not be correct. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*36084 = 108252.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I was not following this pattern correctly. I think I mistakenly thought that after each multiplication by 3, I added 1, but perhaps that's incorrect.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the expression correctly. Let's take a smaller version to test.\n\nSuppose I have just 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(4) = 12.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOutermost: 3*(13) = 39.\n\nAlternatively, using the recursive approach: f(1) = 4, f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, f(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, but the actual computation gives 39. So, clearly, the recursive approach is not matching when n=3.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So, perhaps my recursive function is not correctly modeling the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether each layer is 3*(1 + previous) or whether the previous is 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, let's take the small example: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: 3*(4) = 12.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOutermost: 3*(13) = 39.\n\nSo, in this case, there are three layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, if I model f(n) as the value of the inner expression with n layers, then f(1) = 4, f(2) = 13, f(3) = 39.\n\nWait, but according to the recursive approach, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), then f(1) = 4, f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, f(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, which doesn't match the manual computation of 39.\n\nSo, clearly, the recursive function f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)) is not matching the manual computation. Therefore, my initial approach was correct, and the recursive function is not correctly modeling the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how I'm defining the layers. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3*(1 + ...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nLayer3: 1 + Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer4: 3*(Layer3) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer5: 1 + Layer4 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer6: 3*(Layer5) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nLayer7: 1 + Layer6 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer8: 3*(Layer7) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nLayer9: 1 + Layer8 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer10: 3*(Layer9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but in the problem, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of \"3(\" in the expression.\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nSo, each \"3(\" starts a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. 3(1 + 3(...))\n4. 3(1 + 3(...))\n5. 3(1 + 3(...))\n6. 3(1 + 3(...))\n7. 3(1 + 3(...))\n8. 3(1 + 3(...))\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, nine \"3(\" expressions, meaning nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, after computing Layer9, which is 364, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried the recursive approach, I thought that each layer is 3*(1 + previous), leading to f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), which didn't match the manual computation. So, perhaps the correct way is that each layer alternates between 3*(...) and 1 + ...? That seems inconsistent, but when I computed the small example, that's what I did.\n\nWait, in the small example: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 39.\n\nUsing the layer approach:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(4) = 12.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer4: 3*(13) = 39.\n\nSo, four layers: three inner layers plus the outermost. Wait, but in the problem, the outermost is also a 3*(...), so perhaps the number of layers is nine, leading to Layer10 as the outermost.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust my layer counting. Let me try again.\n\nIn the problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: 3*(Layer1) = 12.\n\nLayer3: 1 + Layer2 = 13.\n\nLayer4: 3*(Layer3) = 39.\n\nLayer5: 1 + Layer4 = 40.\n\nLayer6: 3*(Layer5) = 120.\n\nLayer7: 1 + Layer6 = 121.\n\nLayer8: 3*(Layer7) = 363.\n\nLayer9: 1 + Layer8 = 364.\n\nLayer10: 3*(Layer9) = 1092.\n\nSo, the total expression is Layer10, which is 1092.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought of it as a recursive function f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting with f(1) = 4, that approach didn't align with the manual computation because f(3) would be 3*(1 + 15) = 48, but manually, it's 13, then 39. So, that suggests that the recursive function approach is not applicable here because the structure alternates between 3*(...) and 1 + ... in each layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that each pair of layers is 3*(1 + ...), so for each \"3*(1 + ...)\", it's a layer. So, with nine such layers, we have nine sets of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, in the small example with three layers inside the outermost 3*(...), we have:\n\nLayer1: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier layering, it's Layer1: 4, Layer2: 12, Layer3:13, Layer4:39. So, perhaps the number of layers is one more than the number of \"3(\" expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising from how I'm counting the layers. Let me try a different approach. Let me write the expression with indices to make it clearer.\n\nLet me denote E(n) as the expression with n layers. So, E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nE(2) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nE(3) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 4)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but in my manual computation earlier, with three layers inside, I got 39, but according to E(3) as defined here, it's 48. So, that suggests a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that E(n) as defined here includes the outermost 3*(...), whereas my manual computation included more layers. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let's take E(n) as the expression with n layers, each layer being 3*(1 + ...). So, E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nE(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nE(3) = 3*(1 + E(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nE(4) = 3*(1 + E(3)) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nE(5) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but according to this, E(5) is 1092. But in the problem, how many layers do we have? The problem has nine layers inside the outermost 3*(...), so E(9) would be the value.\n\nWait, let me compute E(n) up to n=9:\n\nE(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nE(2) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39.\n\nE(3) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120.\n\nE(4) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363.\n\nE(5) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092.\n\nE(6) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279.\n\nE(7) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9834.\n\nE(8) = 3*(1 + 9834) = 29505.\n\nE(9) = 3*(1 + 29505) = 88518.\n\nWait, but according to my initial manual computation, the answer was 1092, which corresponds to E(5). So, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers in the problem.\n\nWait, the problem is written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"3*(1 + ...)\" expressions.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n9. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nSo, nine \"3*(1 + ...)\" layers, meaning that the entire expression is E(9) as per the recursive function, which would be 88518. But earlier, when I computed manually, I got 1092, which is E(5). So, there's a clear discrepancy here.\n\nThis suggests that I'm miscounting the number of layers in the problem. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let's count how many times we do this.\n\nEach \"3*(1 + ...)\" is a layer. Let's count:\n\nLayer1: 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), and then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, for each \"3*(1 + ...)\", it's a layer. So, if there are nine such layers, then the total expression is E(9) as per the recursive function, which is 88518.\n\nBut in my initial manual computation, I only went up to Layer9 as 364 and then multiplied by 3 to get 1092, which would correspond to E(5). So, clearly, I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the expression is structured with nine layers inside the outermost 3*(...), so the total number of layers is nine, making the entire expression E(9). Therefore, the answer should be 88518.\n\nBut in my initial approach, I thought that after nine layers, I had 364, then multiplied by 3 to get 1092, which is E(5). So, I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to visualize the expression as a tree. The outermost is 3*(1 + ...). The inner part is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), and so on. Each \"3*(1 + ...)\" is a layer. So, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, with nine layers, the value is E(9) = 88518.\n\nBut then, why did my initial manual computation give me 1092? Because I was only computing up to Layer5, perhaps.\n\nWait, let me try to compute E(n) up to n=9 step by step.\n\nE(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nE(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nE(3) = 3*(1 + E(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nE(4) = 3*(1 + E(3)) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nE(5) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nE(6) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279.\n\nE(7) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840.\n\nE(8) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nE(9) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So, E(9) is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check E(5) again: 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092. Correct.\n\nE(6): 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Correct.\n\nE(7): 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Correct.\n\nE(8): 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Correct.\n\nE(9): 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 524*3=1572. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, according to this, the expression with nine layers is 88572.\n\nBut in my initial manual computation, I only went up to Layer9 as 364, then multiplied by 3 to get 1092, which is E(5). So, I think I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I miscounted the number of layers in the expression. Let me try to count the number of \"3*(1 + ...)\" in the problem.\n\nThe problem is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the outermost, each \"3*(1 + ...)\" is a layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n9. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\nYes, nine layers. So, according to the recursive function, E(9) = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial manual computation, I only went up to Layer9 as 364, then multiplied by 3 to get 1092, which is E(5). So, I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that the innermost is Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nLayer4: "

Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me check: The innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9. Then the whole thing is multiplied by 3. So, if I compute each Layer from 1 to 9, I can build up the solution step by step. Let me try that. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Next, Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's interesting. Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Okay, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. That's a big number. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Thus, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. So Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.

    "text": " Let me think: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 3 times the previous result. So, perhaps I can define each layer as a function of the previous one. Let me try to express this step by step. Let's define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me denote the innermost expression as a base case and then build up. Let me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). So, that's 1 + 3, which is 4. Let's write that down: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Now, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay. Layer 3 is 40.

So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Calculating that: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's see: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Calculating that: 3*9841 is... let me do 9841*3. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to miscalculate with such large numbers. Let me verify each layer step by step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

So, the final result is 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. I think that's the correct answer after carefully computing each layer step by step. It's a bit tedious, but breaking it down made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Because this seems like a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake somewhere.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a nested expression where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me see.\n\nThe recurrence relation here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, 3*a_9=3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I also get 88572, which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula without computing each layer, but since the number of layers isn't too large, computing each step by step is manageable.\n\nSo, just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I arrived at the final result of 88572. Additionally, by modeling the problem as a recurrence relation, I derived a formula that allowed me to compute the result without manually calculating each layer, which confirmed the answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, we find the result of each layer and substitute it into the next until reaching the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me define each innermost expression as a variable to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- Let\u2019s call the innermost part as A9: 1 + 3\n- Then the next one out is A8: 1 + 3*A9\n- Then A7: 1 + 3*A8\n- And so on, until A1, which will be the outermost expression.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nA9 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen A8 = 1 + 3*A9 = 1 + 3*4\n\nWait, let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so A8 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, A7 = 1 + 3*A8 = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so A7 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen A6 = 1 + 3*A7 = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so A6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nMoving outward, A5 = 1 + 3*A6 = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so A5 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext, A4 = 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364 is... let me calculate that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Therefore, A4 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nThen, A3 = 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. So, A3 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext, A2 = 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, A2 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nFinally, A1 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is... wait, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123, so 2400 + 123 = 2523. Therefore, 3*9841 is 29523 (Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again.)\n\nWait, maybe I should compute 3*9841 step by step. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Therefore, A1 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3*(A1), right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the entire expression is 3*A1. So, if A1 is 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nA9 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nA2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nA1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check the multiplication for 3*29524.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the A1 to A9 steps.\n\nA9: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA8: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA7: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA6: 1 + 3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA5: 1 + 3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA4: 1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA3: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA2: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA1: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, all the steps seem correct. Therefore, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each A(n) = 1 + 3*A(n-1). This seems like a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me write down the terms:\n\nA1 = 1 + 3*A2\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is A9, so maybe it's better to index them from A1 to A9, with A1 being the innermost. Wait, no, in my initial approach, A9 was the innermost. Maybe I should reverse that for clarity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think. Each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I let x be the innermost term, then each layer is 1 + 3x, where x is the next layer. But since it's nested, maybe I can express it as a sum.\n\nWait, but with nine layers, it's going to be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote A(n) as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, A(1) = 1 + 3. Then, A(2) = 1 + 3*A(1), and so on, up to A(9). But in the original problem, the expression is 3*(A(9)), because the outermost layer is 3*(...). Wait, no, actually, the original expression is 3*(A(9)), but let me check.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is A1 = 4. Then, the next one is A2 = 1 + 3*A1 = 13, and so on, up to A9 = 1 + 3*A8. Then, the outermost expression is 3*A9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(A9). So, in that case, the total value would be 3*A9.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought A1 was the outermost, but now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nIf I start from the innermost, which is the last 1 + 3, that's A1 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is A2 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen A3 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, until A9 = 1 + 3*A8.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A9.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to A1 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But if A9 is the innermost, then A9 is 4, and the expression is 3*A9, which would be 12, which is clearly not the case. So, I must have mislabeled the layers.\n\nI think the confusion arises from how I'm labeling the layers. Let me try again, more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nLet me index them from the innermost to the outermost as L1 to L9.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, starting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's the same result as before, so that must be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand it, the expression would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWhich, when expanded, would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))))))))\n\nBut that seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nIn general, for an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers, the value can be expressed as a geometric series. But in this case, a is 1, and b is 3, and there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and building outward.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as a recurrence relation where each term is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), L(1)=4\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L(n) = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find D by setting L(n) = D, so D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n, and the particular solution is -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and the recurrence relation approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, if I compute each E from E1 to E9, then multiply the result by 3, I should get the answer. Let me compute each E step by step. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. So, E2 = 13. Moving on to E3: E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. E3 = 40. Next, E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. E4 = 121. Now, E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. E5 = 364. Next, E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. E6 = 1093. Moving on to E7: E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. E7 = 3280. Next, E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. E8 = 9841. Finally, E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might be a bit messy.

So, putting it all together: 7, then 7, then 7, then 5, then 2, and finally 2. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should do it more carefully. Let me write it out:\n\n3\n*29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8,7,7,5,7,2.

Let's compute 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524: 4+4=8, 2+2=4, 5+5=10 (carry 1), 9+9=18 +1=19 (carry 1), 2+2=4 +1=5. So, that gives 59048. Then, adding 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 8+4=12, 4+2=6, 0+5=5, 9+9=18, 5+2=7, carryovers: 5+2=7, 9+9=18 (carry 1), 5+2=7 +1=8, 9+9=18 (carry 1), 5+2=7 +1=8, 5+2=7, 5+2=7. Wait, this is getting messy. Maybe I should just do it digit by digit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing E9. Let me double-check E9. E9 = 1 + 3*E8, where E8 = 9841. So, 3*9841: Let me compute 9841*3. 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, starting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2\nBut since there are no more digits, write down the 2. So, it's 29523. Then, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. That seems correct. So, then 3*E9 is 3*29524. Let me compute this using another method. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Starting from the innermost: E1=4, E2=13, E3=40, E4=121, E5=364, E6=1093, E7=3280, E8=9841, E9=29524. Then, 3*E9=88572. That seems correct. Wait, just to be thorough, let me check one or two of the E computations again. For example, E3: E2=13, so E3=1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. E4=1 + 3*40=1+120=121. Correct. E5=1 + 3*121=1+363=364. Correct. E6=1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. E7=1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. E8=1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. E9=1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's the right answer. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the inside out. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Starting with the innermost expression and moving outward, each layer is computed step by step until the final result is obtained.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Define Each Layer**:\n   - Let E1 = 1 + 3\n   - E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n   - E3 = 1 + 3*E2\n   - Continue this pattern up to E9.\n\n3. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - E9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n   - Total = 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Let me number the innermost parentheses as Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, Layer 3, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (no more parentheses inside) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) And finally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1, I can build up to the final result. Let me try that approach. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting, it's increasing by 9 each time? Wait, Layer 1 was 4, Layer 2 was 13 (which is 4 + 9), Layer 3 is 40 (which is 13 + 27). Wait, no, that's not consistent. Maybe it's better to just compute each step without looking for a pattern yet. Let me proceed step by step. Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so total is 300+60+3=363. Then, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those up: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding them: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Therefore, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding up: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. So, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding these: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Therefore, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them together: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's verify that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, I could compute 29524*3 directly: 29524*3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off. Wait, let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8, carry over 0.\nThere are no more digits, so write down the carry over 0 if any, but here it's done.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my initial calculation was right. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me assign each inner expression as follows: Let\u2019s say E1 is the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3 Then, moving outward, E2 = 1 + 3*E1, E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9, which would be the outermost expression. So, the entire expression is 3*E9. Wait, no, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(...), so actually, the entire expression is 3*E9, where E9 is 1 + 3*E8, and so on. Hmm, maybe I should correct that. Let me think again. The outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so if I denote each inner part as E1, E2, etc., starting from the innermost, then E1 = 1 + 3, E2 = 1 + 3*E1, E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on until E9 = 1 + 3*E8. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9. So, I need to compute E1 through E9 step by step. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3. That's simple, 1 + 3 is 4. So, E1 = 4.\n\nNext, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, E2 = 13.\n\nMoving on to E3: E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, E3 = 40.\n\nNow, E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, E4 = 121.\n\nNext, E5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, E5 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, E6 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6. E6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, E7 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7. E7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, E8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, E9 = 1 + 3*E8. E8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, E9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E9, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in breaking it down. Alternatively, I can do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it down: 7 7 5 7 2 4? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me try again:\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7.\n\n5 *3=15, write 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7.\n\n9 *3=27, write 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 *3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, the number is 88572. Wait, that matches what I had before. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that 29524 *3 is indeed 88572. Let me add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524 is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E9. Let me go back through each step again to verify.\n\nE1 = 1 +3=4.\n\nE2=1 +3*4=1+12=13.\n\nE3=1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nE4=1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nE5=1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nE6=1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nE7=1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nE8=1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nE9=1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check E7 again because 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1+3279=3280, correct.\n\nE8: 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840, plus 1 is 9841, correct.\n\nE9: 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1+29523=29524, correct.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each step. Since each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, and there are 9 layers, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can represent E_n after n layers. Let me see if I can find a pattern or derive a formula.\n\nLooking at the values I computed:\n\nE1=4\n\nE2=13\n\nE3=40\n\nE4=121\n\nE5=364\n\nE6=1093\n\nE7=3280\n\nE8=9841\n\nE9=29524\n\nHmm, these numbers seem familiar. Let me check if they follow a geometric progression or something similar.\n\nLooking at E1=4, E2=13, E3=40, E4=121, E5=364, etc. Let me see the ratios between consecutive terms:\n\n13/4=3.25\n\n40/13\u22483.077\n\n121/40\u22483.025\n\n364/121\u22483.008\n\n1093/364\u22483.000\n\nWait, that's interesting. It seems like each term is approaching a multiple of 3. Let me check: 3*E_{n-1} +1 = E_n.\n\nWait, so the recurrence relation is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me try to find the particular solution. Assume E_n = C, a constant. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E1=4. When n=1, E1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2. So, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2. Therefore, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: E1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Since 3^10 is 59049, so E9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since E9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*E9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which gives the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern E\u2099 = 1 + 3\u00d7E\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting with E\u2081 = 4. By iteratively computing each layer up to E\u2089, we find that E\u2089 = 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form E\u2099 = 1 + 3\u00d7E\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting with E\u2081 = 4.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - E\u2081 = 4\n   - E\u2082 = 13\n   - E\u2083 = 40\n   - E\u2084 = 121\n   - E\u2085 = 364\n   - E\u2086 = 1093\n   - E\u2087 = 3280\n   - E\u2088 = 9841\n   - E\u2089 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me define each part as follows: Let\u2019s denote the innermost expression as A9, then the next one as A8, and so on, until the outermost expression is A0. So, starting from the innermost: A9 = 1 + 3 Then, A8 = 1 + 3*A9 A7 = 1 + 3*A8 And so on, until A0 = 1 + 3*A1, and the entire expression is 3*A0. So, if I compute each A from A9 up to A0, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me compute each step one by one. Starting with A9: A9 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving to A8: A8 = 1 + 3*A9 = 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, A8 = 13. Next, A7 = 1 + 3*A8 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Therefore, A7 = 40. Now, A6 = 1 + 3*A7 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So, A6 = 121. Continuing to A5: A5 = 1 + 3*A6 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Thus, A5 = 364. Moving on to A4: A4 = 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Therefore, A4 = 1093. Next, A3: A3 = 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, A3 = 3280. Now, A2: A2 = 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives us 9841. Therefore, A2 = 9841. Moving to A1: A1 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, A1 = 29524. Finally, A0: A0 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 3*29524. Calculating 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives us 88573. So, A0 = 88573. Now, the entire expression is 3*A0, which is 3*88573. Let's compute that. 3*80000 = 240000, 3*8000 = 24000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*70 = 210, and 3*3 = 9. Adding them all together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Therefore, the entire expression equals 265,719. Wait, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to miscalculate. Let me go back through each step.\n\nStarting with A9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nA8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nA7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nA6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nA5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nA4: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192. 900+192=1092. 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nA3: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nA2: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nA1: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nA0: 1 + 3*29524. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. 60000+27000=87000+1500=88500+72=88572. 1+88572=88573. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*A0: 3*88573. Let's compute 88573*3:\n\n- 3*3=9\n- 3*7=21, carryover 2\n- 3*5=15 + 2=17, carryover 1\n- 3*8=24 +1=25, carryover 2\n- 3*8=24 +2=26.\n\nSo writing it down: 265,719. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait a second, but let me do it another way to double-check. 88573 * 3:\n\n88,573 * 3:\n- 3*3=9\n- 3*7=21, write down 1, carryover 2\n- 3*5=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1\n- 3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2\n- 3*8=24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2, but since there are no more digits, write down 2.\n\nWait, that would give 265,719? Wait, let me write it out:\n\nMultiplying 88,573 by 3:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, write 1, carryover 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 +2=26, write 6, carryover 2\n\nBut since we're done with digits, we write the carryover 2 before the rest, so it's 265,719. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 88,573 * 3.\n\n80,000 *3=240,000\n\n8,000 *3=24,000\n\n500 *3=1,500\n\n70 *3=210\n\n3*3=9\n\nAdding them up: 240,000 +24,000=264,000; 264,000 +1,500=265,500; 265,500 +210=265,710; 265,710 +9=265,719. Yes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 265,719.\n\nI guess another way to approach this problem would be to recognize the pattern and see if there's a formula or a geometric series involved. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, starting from x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and so on up to x_9, and then the total expression is 3x_9. Hmm, that might be a way to model it, but since I've already computed each step manually and double-checked, maybe it's not necessary unless I suspect an error in my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps recognizing that each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. Let me consider that. The general form for such a recurrence relation is x_n = a*r^n + b, where a and b are constants. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for x_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation: x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving x_n - 3x_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is x_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution x_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence relation: K = 1 + 3K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is x_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition x_1 = 4. So, when n=1, x_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: x_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: x_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: x_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: x_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: x_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: x_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: x_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: x_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: x_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, that matches perfectly with the values I calculated earlier. So, the closed-form expression is x_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, x_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, hold on, that's different from what I calculated earlier. Wait, no, 3*x_9 would be 3*(29524) = 88572, but earlier I had A0 = 88573, and then 3*A0 = 265,719. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*A0, where A0 = 1 + 3*A1, and A1 = 1 + 3*A2, etc., down to A9 = 1 + 3. So, in the closed-form, x_n is A_{10 - n}? Wait, perhaps I got the indexing wrong.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When I defined A9 as the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3, then A8 is 1 + 3*A9, etc., up to A0 being the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3. So, in terms of the recurrence, A_{k} = 1 + 3*A_{k+1}, starting from A9 = 4.\n\nBut in the closed-form solution, I considered x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, starting from x1=4, which would correspond to A9=4, A8=13, etc., so x_n = A_{9 - (n -1)}? Hmm, maybe it's better to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the closed-form expression gives A_{n} = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n starts at 1. So, A9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which is correct. Then, A0 would be (3^{10} -1)/2 as well? Wait, no, because A0 is computed as 1 + 3*A1, which is 1 + 3*( (3^{9} -1)/2 ). Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.\n\nWait, let me think again. The closed-form solution I derived was for x_n where x1 = 4, x2 =13, x3=40, etc., so x_n corresponds to A_{10 - n} perhaps? Because x1 = A9, x2 = A8, ..., x9 = A1, x10 = A0.\n\nWait, if x_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then x9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which is A1. Then, A0 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*A0 = 3*88573 = 265,719. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, using the closed-form, I can compute A0 directly. Since A0 = 1 + 3*A1, and A1 = x9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. So, A0 =1 + 3*29524 =1 + 88572=88573. Then, the total expression is 3*A0=3*88573=265,719.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each step. Let me see. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is 3*A0, where A0 =1 + 3*A1, A1=1 + 3*A2, and so on until A9=1 + 3. So, if I let the entire expression be E, then E = 3*A0, where A0 =1 + 3*A1, and so on. But since each A is defined in terms of the next, perhaps I can write E in terms of itself. Wait, let's see.\n\nIf I consider E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and notice that the inner part (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) is similar to E/3. Because E =3*(inner expression), so inner expression = E/3. Therefore, E = 3*(1 + 3*(inner expression)) =3*(1 + 3*(E/3))=3*(1 + E). Wait, that seems promising.\n\nLet me write that down: E =3*(1 + 3*(inner expression)). But the inner expression is the same as E/3, because E is 3 times that inner expression. So, substituting, E =3*(1 + 3*(E/3))=3*(1 + E). So, E = 3*(1 + E). Wait, that can't be right because that would imply E =3 + 3E, which would lead to E = -3/2, which is impossible because all terms are positive. Therefore, my assumption that the inner expression is E/3 must be incorrect because the inner expression is actually A0, which is part of E, but E is 3*A0. So, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me denote the entire expression as E =3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and notice that the part inside the first set of parentheses is (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is similar to E/3, but actually, it's A0. Since E =3*A0, then A0 = E/3. But A0 is also equal to1 + 3*A1. So, A0 =1 + 3*A1, but A1 is another similar expression. However, since each subsequent A is similar but with one fewer layer, perhaps I can express A0 in terms of A1, A1 in terms of A2, and so on, but that might not directly help in forming an equation for E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write E in terms of itself by recognizing the repeating structure. Let me try that. Let me consider that the innermost expression is A9=4, then A8=13, etc., but that approach is similar to computing each step manually, which I've already done.\n\nAlternatively, since I have a closed-form expression for A_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then A0 would be (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, but wait, no, that's A1. Wait, I think I'm getting confused with the indices. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom the closed-form, x_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where x1=4, x2=13, x3=40, etc. So, x1 corresponds to A9=4, x2 corresponds to A8=13, and so on, up to x9 corresponds to A1=29524. Therefore, A0 is 1 + 3*A1 =1 + 3*x9=1 +3*(3^{10}-1)/2=1 + (3^{11} -3)/2=(2 +3^{11} -3)/2=(3^{11} -1)/2. Wait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573, which matches my earlier calculation of A0=88573. Therefore, E=3*A0=3*(88573)=265,719.\n\nSo, using the closed-form, I can compute A0 directly without computing each step. That's a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the pattern and finding a closed-form expression, I can compute the value more efficiently. However, since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible, albeit time-consuming and prone to arithmetic errors if not careful.\n\nTo ensure that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, I cross-verified each step, and then I used a different method (recurrence relation and closed-form solution) to arrive at the same result. Both methods gave me E=265,719, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n\nOne thing I might have done differently is to use a calculator for the large multiplications, but since I'm doing it manually, I had to break down each multiplication into smaller parts, which worked fine. It's also a good practice to check each step as I go along, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions.\n\nIn conclusion, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of each result.\n3. Verify each computation to minimize errors.\n4. Optionally, derive a closed-form expression using recurrence relations to compute the result more efficiently.\n5. Cross-validate the result using both methods to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis approach helped me tackle the problem methodically and arrive at the correct solution without getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the expression.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the results are used in the subsequent layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that the closed-form solution for each layer is \\( x_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula, we compute the outermost layer and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{265719}."

Then, the entire expression would be 3*E9. So, I need to compute E1, then E2 using E1, then E3 using E2, and so on, until I get to E9, and then multiply that by 3. That seems manageable. Let me write this out step by step. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so E2 is 13. Next, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. E3 is 40. Moving on, E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, E4 is 121. Then, E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E5 is 364. Next, E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, so E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E6 is 1093. Now, E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so total is 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Therefore, E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E7 is 3280. Continuing, E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Thus, E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E8 is 9841. Finally, E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let me break it down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, E9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. E9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572. So, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from E1 to E9, each step seems correct. E1=4, E2=13, E3=40, E4=121, E5=364, E6=1093, E7=3280, E8=9841, E9=29524. Multiplying E9 by 3 gives 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about that. Each E_n is defined as 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting with E1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E_n. The recurrence relation is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps it's a geometric series. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, we have A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is E_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition E1=4. So, when n=1, E1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. Simplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with E1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. E2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. E3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*E9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to get there without computing each E_n step by step. That might have saved some time, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. But it's good to know the general formula in case the number of layers increases. Anyway, so after computing each layer step by step, and then verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572. I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. We define each nested expression as follows:\n\n- \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( E_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as \\( 3 \\cdot E_9 \\):\n\n- \\( 3 \\cdot E_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me denote the innermost part as Layer 1, then the next one as Layer 2, and so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, looking again, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? So that's the base case, Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the next layer. Let me try to write this down more systematically.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that seems manageable. So, I can compute Layer 1 first, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on, until I get to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nLet me start with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is 1 + 3*4.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nSo, Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving on to Layer 3:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating 3*13:\n\n3*13 = 39\n\nSo, Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that's a big jump from 13 to 40. Hmm, but okay, let's continue.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 = 120\n\nSo, Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWhoa, now that's a significant increase. I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be growing quite rapidly. Let me keep going.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCalculating 3*121:\n\n3*120 = 360, and 3*1 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCalculating 3*364:\n\n3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nOkay, Layer 6 is 1093. Let's do Layer 7:\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCalculating 3*1093:\n\nWell, 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWow, that's a big number. Let's go to Layer 8.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCalculating 3*3280:\n\n3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nAlright, Layer 8 is 9841. Now, onto Layer 9:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCalculating 3*9841:\n\nHmm, let me break this down. 3*9000 = 27,000, 3*800 = 2,400, 3*40 = 120, and 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nSo, Layer 9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nOkay, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute that:\n\n3 * 29,524\n\nCalculating that:\n\nWell, 3*20,000 = 60,000\n\n3*9,000 = 27,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that because 3*29,524 is 88,572? Hmm, let me compute it another way to confirm.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88,572. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors along the way. It's easy to make a mistake with large numbers, especially with so many layers. Let me go back and verify each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, seems like all the layers check out correctly. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Perhaps there's a formula or a pattern that can be generalized for such nested expressions. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous plus particular. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me verify this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is indeed 29,524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step layer computation and the general formula for the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work, and I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the value of the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Subsequent layers build upon this, leading up to Layer 9, which is 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me number them from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking back, the innermost part is Layer 9, right? Because the first parentheses I see is Layer 1, but it's actually the outermost. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which would be Layer 2. And this continues until Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. So, let me define each layer step by step. Let me start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 = 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3. Calculating each part: 20000*3 = 60000 9000*3 = 27000 500*3 = 1500 24*3 = 72 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. So, each layer was computed correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 also checks out. Therefore, the result of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.

Hmm, that's getting bigger. a\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's a jump. a\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, this is growing exponentially, which makes sense because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. a\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, a\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3a\u2089, so I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check the multiplication step again, because that's where I might have made an error.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nNo more digits, so write down the carry over 2 if any, but there isn't one here. Wait, actually, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\nNext: 5*3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\nNext: 9*3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 87572. But earlier, I thought it was 88572. Wait, that's conflicting. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the earlier breakdown. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4*3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n- Hundreds place: 5*3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n- Thousands place: 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n- Ten-thousands place: 9*3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 87572. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. So, which one is correct? Let me add 29524 + 29524 + 29524 to check.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nLet's add:\n\n59048\n\n+29524\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the units:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5, write 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, total is 88572. Wait, but when I multiplied digit by digit, I got 87572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check the digit-wise multiplication again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n\n    *      3\n\n    -----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's the same as adding it up. So, where did I go wrong earlier? Oh, I see. When I did the digit-wise multiplication before, I think I forgot to carry over the 2 from the 9*3 +1. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, when I did the digit-wise multiplication earlier, I had:\n\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572, not 87572. I must have miscounted the digits earlier. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I added 29524 three times, I also got 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, my initial breakdown into place values was incorrect because I miscounted the digits. So, the correct multiplication is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and define a sequence a\u2081 through a\u2089 where each a\u2096 = 1 + 3a\u2096\u208b\u2081.\n\n2. Compute each a\u2096 step by step:\n\n   a\u2081 = 4\n\n   a\u2082 = 13\n\n   a\u2083 = 40\n\n   a\u2084 = 121\n\n   a\u2085 = 364\n\n   a\u2086 = 1093\n\n   a\u2087 = 3280\n\n   a\u2088 = 9841\n\n   a\u2089 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply a\u2089 by 3 to get the final result: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\n4. Verify the multiplication by adding 29524 three times, which also gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computation seems correct. I don't see any errors in the steps now. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By defining a sequence a\u2081 through a\u2089, each term is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous term. Starting from a\u2081 = 4, each subsequent term is calculated step by step until a\u2089 = 29524. Multiplying a\u2089 by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me number them from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 times 3. Let me break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive relation. It's a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. Let me try that. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, where k and c are constants. In this case, k is 3 and c is 1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 + (c)/(k - 1))*(k)^{n-1} - (c)/(k - 1). Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches Layer 3. Good, so the formula seems correct. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. That's the same as Layer 9 that I computed earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572, as I found before. So, both methods agree, which makes me more confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to see this. Let me consider the structure of the expression. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, you're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric series. But in this case, it's a finite nested expression, so it's not an infinite series. Let me see if I can express the entire expression in terms of a sum. Let me denote the innermost expression as E1 = 1 + 3. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1. E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on until E9. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9. So, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4. As I found earlier, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. Then, 3*E9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding it. Starting from the innermost layer: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. Wait, that seems to be a pattern. Each E_n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Let me check: For E1: sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4, correct. E2: sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, correct. E3: sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, correct. So, in general, E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by some coefficients. Let me see. If I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which would result in 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to a certain number of terms. Let me see how many terms there are. Each layer adds another power of 3. Since there are nine layers, the expansion would go up to 3^9. Let me check: Starting from the innermost, E1 = 1 + 3. Then E2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9. E3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. So, each En adds another term 3^n. Therefore, E9 would be sum_{k=0}^9 3^k, but wait, no, because each E_n is sum_{k=0}^n 3^k, but in our case, the outermost expression is 3*E9, which would be 3*(sum_{k=0}^9 3^k) = sum_{k=1}^{10} 3^k. Wait, let's check that. If E9 = sum_{k=0}^9 3^k, then 3*E9 = 3*sum_{k=0}^9 3^k = sum_{k=0}^9 3^{k+1} = sum_{k=1}^{10} 3^k. So, the entire expression is the sum of 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{10}. Let me compute that sum. The sum of a geometric series from k=1 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. So, for n=10, it's (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177,147. So, 177,147 - 3 = 177,144. Then, 177,144 / 2 = 88,572. That's the same result as before. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the expression is equal to the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k, which is (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88,572. So, whether I compute it layer by layer, use the recursive formula, or express it as a geometric series, I end up with the same answer: 88,572. I think that's pretty thorough. I've checked it using multiple methods, and they all confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " Let me denote each innermost expression as E1, then E2, up to E9, where E9 is the innermost one. So, E1 would be the innermost 1 + 3, then E2 would be 1 + 3(E1), and so on, until E9 is the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses. Wait, actually, since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), perhaps I should start from the innermost and work my way out. Let me try that. So, starting with the innermost part: The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that's the next layer. Let me note that down: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. Let me see if this pattern continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Layer 9: 29524 Now, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is Layer 9, which is 29524. Then, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Now, multiplying this by 3: 3*29524. Let's compute this again to be sure. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me denote the innermost expression as Layer 1, then Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. That seems manageable. So, let's compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Next, Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Let me check if this continues. Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final result is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Let me verify Layer 9 again: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is indeed 29523, and 29523 + 1 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each Layer n as L_n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n from 2 to 9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. The formula is L_n = (L_1 - b/(a - 1)) * a^{n-1} + b/(a - 1). Let me plug in the values. Here, a = 3, b = 1, and L_1 = 4. So, L_n = (4 - 1/(3 - 1)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(3 - 1). Simplifying, 1/(3 - 1) is 1/2. So, L_n = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2 = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (7*3^{n-1} + 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (7*3^{0} + 1)/2 = (7*1 + 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (7*3^{1} + 1)/2 = (21 + 1)/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I computed Layer 2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake in the formula? Let me check. Wait, no, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, for n=2, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches my earlier computation. But according to the formula, L_2 should be (7*3^{1} + 1)/2 = (21 + 1)/2 = 11. That's not matching. So, my formula must be incorrect. Let me re-examine the derivation. The standard formula for a linear recurrence L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n-1}*(L_1 + b/(a - 1)) - b/(a - 1). Wait, perhaps I had the formula slightly wrong. Let me derive it step by step. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*a^n. The particular solution, since b is a constant, we can assume L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K*(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). So, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + K. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*a^1 + K => 4 = C*a + K. We know K = b/(1 - a) = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, 4 = C*3 + (-1/2). Therefore, C*3 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n + (-1/2) = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the correct formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 is 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches my earlier computation of Layer 9 = 29524. So, then the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 is 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using a formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer is \\(29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when I look at the original problem, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(...), and there are nine such layers. So, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*L9, where L9 is the result after nine layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I computed up to L9 as 29524, so then the total expression is 3*29524, which would be 88572.\n\nBut let me verify each step carefully because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake here.\n\nStarting from L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check L9 again because when I compute 3*9841, that's 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check L8: 3*3280. Let's compute 3280 * 3. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9840. Then 9840 +1 = 9841. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, L7: 3*1093.

Let me count the number of times I added a layer. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, (1+3), that's one layer, then each additional (1+3(...) adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3.

Inside that: (1+3(...))\n3. Then another: (1+3(...))\n4. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers. Each time I see a \"(\", it's a new layer. So starting from the innermost, let's count the number of parentheses.\n\nWait, maybe I can count how many times I see a \"1+3(\" in the expression. Let me look again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first is 3(1+3(...)), then inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the innermost is the first layer, and each layer outward adds another. So, the innermost is (1+3), which is L1. Then each layer moving outward is L2, L3, etc.\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of layers. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, let's count the number of times we have (1+3(...)).\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), which is one layer.\n- Then, moving out, each time we have (1+3(1+3(...))), so each additional layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(...). Let me count:\n\n- The first \"1+3(\" is the innermost, then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for such a nested expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet me think about this. The expression is a geometric series, perhaps. Each term is 1 + 3*previous term, so it's a recurrence relation.\n\nWait, let me define a recurrence relation where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed nine. Because each \"1+3(\" corresponds to a layer, and the original expression has nine such layers inside the initial 3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each (1+3( adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3( : that's the first layer, L1.\n2. Then, inside that, another (1+3( : L2.\n3. Continuing, each time I see a (1+3(, that's a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count how many times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n- The first is inside the initial 3(1+3(...)), so that's L1.\n- Then, inside that, another (1+3(...)), so L2.\n- This continues until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which I think is nine times. Wait, but in the expression, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the initial 3(1+3(...)), then each subsequent (1+3(...) adds another layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression:\n\n- The first is after the initial 3(, so that's one.\n- Then, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers by the number of closing parentheses. Let me see:\n\nEach layer adds a closing parenthesis, so the number of closing parentheses after the initial 3(...) would indicate the number of layers.\n\nWait, the expression ends with ...))))))).\n\nSo, from the innermost, each layer adds a closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end:\n\nThe expression ends with ...))))))).\n\nThat's nine closing parentheses after the innermost (1+3).\n\nWait, so that would mean there are nine layers, each corresponding to a closing parenthesis. Therefore, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another closing parenthesis, so nine layers in total.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had a_9 as 29524, which would correspond to nine layers. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller number of layers to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have just one layer: 3(1+3). That would be 3*(4) = 12. Correct.\n\nTwo layers: 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let's compute that:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier approach, a_2 = 13, and then the total expression is 3*a_2 = 39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, three layers: 3(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))).\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nWhich matches a_3 = 40, total expression 3*40=120.\n\nSo, this approach seems to work.\n\nTherefore, with nine layers, the result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the arithmetic for each step again, just to be sure.\n\nStarting with L1=4.\n\nL2=1 + 3*4=1+12=13.\n\nL3=1 + 3*13=1+39=40.\n\nL4=1 + 3*40=1+120=121.\n\nL5=1 + 3*121=1+363=364.\n\nL6=1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nL7=1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nL8=1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nL9=1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nTotal expression: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct, and I've checked each step multiple times to ensure there are no arithmetic errors.

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the very outermost is 3*(...), which is Layer 9's result. Let me check again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work our way out. Let me try that. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, actually, maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3 step by step. Let's do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next digit: 2*3=6. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So, 3*29524=88572. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from L1: 1+3=4. L2=1+3*4=13. L3=1+3*13=40. L4=1+3*40=121. L5=1+3*121=364. L6=1+3*364=1093. L7=1+3*1093=3280. L8=1+3*3280=9841. L9=1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me check that. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Let me assume a solution of the form L(n) = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1, so B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=1+3=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this for n=1: (3^(2))/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same as I got before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds. For example, L3 should be 40. Let me compute L3 using the recurrence: L1=4, L2=1+3*4=13, L3=1+3*13=40. Correct. Similarly, L4=1+3*40=121, which matches the earlier computation. So, the pattern is consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a recurrence relation and solving it, we find a closed-form solution which confirms our step-by-step computation. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me number them from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking again, the innermost part is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, maybe it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working outwards, each time substituting the result back into the next layer. Let's try that. Let me start with the innermost expression: Layer 1: (1 + 3) That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12. But wait, actually, looking back, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n+1). So maybe I should define each layer as 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me check that. So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do the multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So that's 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer because it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations, especially with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors. Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. So I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without going through each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, and starting from a_9=4, building up to a_1, which is 29524, then multiplying by 3. So yes, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. That seems manageable. Let me try computing each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. Well, 120*3=360, and 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: Let's break it down. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. Adding those: 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.

    "text": " Let me denote each inner expression as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost one: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. But wait, the problem has nine sets of parentheses, so actually, there are nine layers. Let me check that again. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on, until we have nine layers. So, perhaps each layer is built upon the previous one. Let me write them out step by step. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2: 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, actually, let me do it more carefully: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572? Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d73=27000, 500\u00d73=1500, 24\u00d73=72. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake because the problem starts with 3 times the first layer, but I think I included all nine layers. Let me confirm the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times...))) So, each time, it's 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3=4, then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, Layer 3:1+3*13=40, Layer4:1+3*40=121, Layer5:1+3*121=364, Layer6:1+3*364=1093, Layer7:1+3*1093=3280, Layer8:1+3*3280=9841, Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. It looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a structure. Let's denote the value at layer k as L_k. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. So, each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for L_k is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. Substituting the general solution: A*3^k + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B). Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{k-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^k + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^k + B = 1 + A*3^k + 3B. Subtract A*3^k from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1. So, B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When k=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For k=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for k=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula without computing each layer. Let me try that. Since L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me assign variables to each nested expression to make it easier. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define E\u2099 as the expression at each level n.

Then, the final result is 3E\u2089. So, I can compute each E from E\u2081 to E\u2089 step by step. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, compute E\u2081:\n\nE\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, E\u2082:\n\nE\u2082 = 1 + 3E\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot it. Now E\u2083:\n\nE\u2083 = 1 + 3E\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so each time, I'm multiplying the previous E by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern here or if I need to compute each step individually.\n\nContinuing, E\u2084:\n\nE\u2084 = 1 + 3E\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE\u2085:\n\nE\u2085 = 1 + 3E\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE\u2086:\n\nE\u2086 = 1 + 3E\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE\u2087:\n\nE\u2087 = 1 + 3E\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE\u2088:\n\nE\u2088 = 1 + 3E\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE\u2089:\n\nE\u2089 = 1 + 3E\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, so now I have E\u2089 as 29524. The entire expression is 3E\u2089, so I just need to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me do that multiplication:\n\n3 * 29524\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nWait, but that might not be the best way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that I didn't make any mistakes in computing each E\u2099. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with so many steps.\n\nLet me go back and check each E from E\u2081 to E\u2089.\n\nE\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each E\u2099 is correct up to E\u2089.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me confirm that multiplication again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or have a recursive formula that can be solved more efficiently.\n\nLooking back at the original expression, each E\u2099 = 1 + 3E\u2099\u208b\u2081, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, so perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for E\u2099 and then compute E\u2089 directly.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nE\u2099 = 1 + 3E\u2099\u208b\u2081, with E\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is E\u2099 - 3E\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E\u2099^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say E\u2099^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E\u2099 = E\u2099^h + E\u2099^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, E\u2081=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E\u2099 = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nE\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each n, E\u2099 is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E\u2089 would be (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, E\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, 3*E\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the closed-form expression to compute E\u2089 directly without computing each step, which would have saved time, especially if there were more layers.\n\nBut since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. Still, it's good to know that the closed-form solution exists for future reference.\n\nLet me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Recognized the nested structure and defined E\u2099 for each level.\n\n2. Computed each E from E\u2081 to E\u2089 step by step.\n\n3. Verified each computation to avoid arithmetic errors.\n\n4. Considered an alternative approach using recurrence relations to find a closed-form solution.\n\n5. Applied the closed-form formula to compute E\u2089 directly.\n\n6. Multiplied E\u2089 by 3 to get the final result.\n\n7. Verified the multiplication to ensure accuracy.\n\nSo, after all these steps and checks, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and defining each layer as \\( E_n \\). The expression is computed from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then plus 1 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCalculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: Let's break it down. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then plus 1 is 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCalculating 3*9841: Let me do this step by step. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then plus 1 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. The original problem is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29524.\n\nBreaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12.\n\nAdding them together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nSo the total value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me go back and check each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, +12=1092. 1092 +1=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nThen the outermost multiplication: 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that again: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a specific sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula or a pattern to compute this without calculating each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, these numbers look familiar. They seem like they could be related to powers of 3 or something similar. Let me check:\n\nCompute 3^0 = 1\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nHmm, not quite matching. But let's see the differences between the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*13 + 1\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 3*40 + 1\n\nYes, so each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nGiven a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the known layers:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. Therefore, Layer n is equal to (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.
