    "text": " Let's define each layer as follows: Let me number them from the innermost to the outermost. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I can compute each Layer from 1 to 9, I can substitute each into the next until I reach the final result. Let me try that approach. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 Let me compute 3*13. Hmm, 13*3 is 39. So, Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40 Alright, that's 40. Next, Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 Let me compute 3*40. That's 120. So, Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 Let me compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. So, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364 Got it. Layer 5 is 364. Now, Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Okay, Layer 6 is 1093. Moving on to Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Got it, Layer 7 is 3280. Now, Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 Let me compute 3*3280. Hmm, 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Okay, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break that down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, multiplying each part: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait a second, let me just verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3. Let me do it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. So, the number is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything. I started from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, substituting each result into the next layer. Each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer), and I did this nine times, ending up with Layer 9 as 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result, 88572. I think that's correct. I can also check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let's go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. All the steps check out. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. It might have been possible to recognize a geometric series or some recursive formula, but given the time, I think my step-by-step approach is solid. Let me just think if there's another way. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, L_4 = 121, L_5 = 364, L_6 = 1093, L_7 = 3280, L_8 = 9841, L_9 = 29524. Now, looking at the sequence: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, each term seems to be 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me check: 4*3 +1=13, yes. 13*3 +1=40, yes. 40*3 +1=121, yes. 121*3 +1=364, yes. 364*3 +1=1093, yes. 1093*3 +1=3280, yes. 3280*3 +1=9841, yes. 9841*3 +1=29524, yes. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation, and maybe there's a closed-form solution for it. Let me recall that for such a recurrence, L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Let's number the innermost expression as Layer 1 and work our way out to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute each layer step by step, I can build up the solution. Let's start with Layer 1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so: 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\nFinally, 4 * 3 = 12\nNow, add them all together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me verify each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so Layers 1 through 9 are correct. Then, the final step is 3*29524. Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n29524 * 3:\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8\nSo, writing it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total is 88572. Hmm, but let me think again because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, especially with multiplication, it's easy to miscount the layers or misapply the operations. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1), and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's find A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9, since we have 9 layers.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using a different approach, like expanding the expression step by step without using the formula. Let me try that to cross-verify.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nStart with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait a second, just to make sure, maybe I can compute this using a different method, like expanding all the terms. Let's see.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me write this as E = 3(1 + 3E1), where E1 = (1 + 3E2), and so on, until E9 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3E1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3E2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3E3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3E4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSame result again. Okay, so it seems consistent across different methods.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, we have 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSame result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified this enough times using different methods: computing each layer step by step, solving the recurrence relation, and directly computing the multiplication. All approaches lead to the same result. So, I'm pretty sure that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the ninth layer's result, which is 29524. Multiplying 29524 by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me assign each innermost expression a variable to make it easier. Let's say: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can define a recurrence relation here. Let me denote each expression starting from the innermost as a1, then a2, up to a9, where each a_n represents the nth layer from the inside. So, starting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. So, a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have a2 = 1 + 3*a1. Since a1 is 4, then a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that seems manageable. Next layer out, a3 = 1 + 3*a2. So, a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, getting bigger each time. Let's continue this pattern. a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(a9). So, the entire expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again. 20,000*3=60,000. 9,000*3=27,000. 500*3=1,500. 24*3=72. Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 directly: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3 is 88,572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe I can recognize the pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but maybe I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p =1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Another way to think about it is that each layer is building up a geometric series. But since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit different. However, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula seems to have worked well. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, and it would have led me to the same result. It's always good to check using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially with such a large number of nested operations. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (a\u2081):**\n   \\[\n   a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer (a\u2082):**\n   \\[\n   a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer (a\u2083):**\n   \\[\n   a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer (a\u2084):**\n   \\[\n   a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer (a\u2085):**\n   \\[\n   a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer (a\u2086):**\n   \\[\n   a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer (a\u2087):**\n   \\[\n   a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer (a\u2088):**\n   \\[\n   a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Outermost Layer (a\u2089):**\n   \\[\n   a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost 3 with \\(a_9\\):\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me parse the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first (1+3) is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...).

Each time, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, to compute this, I can compute each layer starting from layer 1 and moving outward, each time substituting the value of the inner layer into the outer one.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, so Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing the innermost layers up to Layer 9, which is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in computing one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3 seems a bit tedious, but let's do it carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStart from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, no carryover.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom, we get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original problem has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(:\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis is followed by 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). So, from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of '1+3(' occurrences:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me parse the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the first 3(, it's 1 + 3(...), and each of those ... contains another 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does 1 + 3( occur? Let's see:\n\n- The first one is inside the first parentheses: 1 + 3(\n- Then inside that, another 1 + 3(\n- And so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3), which doesn't have another 1 + 3( inside.\n\nSo, let me count the number of '1 + 3(' sequences. Each time, it's 1 + 3 followed by a new set of parentheses. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. inside that: 1 + 3(\n3. inside that: 1 + 3(\n4. inside that: 1 + 3(\n5. inside that: 1 + 3(\n6. inside that: 1 + 3(\n7. inside that: 1 + 3(\n8. inside that: 1 + 3(\n9. inside that: 1 + 3(\n10. The last one is (1 + 3))\n\nWait, that's 9 '1 + 3(' occurrences, meaning 9 layers, right? So, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3), and each layer outward is another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, that would mean 9 layers, which is what I computed earlier, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach '1+3(' adds a new layer, and the innermost is (1+3). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1+3(Layer 2)\n...\nLayer 9: 1+3(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, each time 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, my computation seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again for Layer 9. So, Layer 8 was 9841, so Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841:\n\n9841 \u00d7 3:\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 2\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 write down 9, carryover 2\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a 4-digit number, so let's compute it properly:\n\n9841 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write 5, carryover 2\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 write 9, carryover 2\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we add the carryover: 2, so the result is 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 \u00d7 3 once more to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a formula for such a nested expression? Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming, and it's easy to make a mistake, especially with so many layers. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can give me the result without computing each layer individually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis kind of expression is a recursive one, where each term is defined in terms of the previous one. Specifically, each layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(layer n-1). So, starting from layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n = 9, L9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrived at the same result without having to compute each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Correct.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost one: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking back, the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer wraps around it. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, this seems to be a pattern where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems to follow, so I think the calculations are correct. I don't see any arithmetic errors upon reviewing. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

    "text": " Let's define each part as follows: Let\u2019s say the innermost part is Layer 1: (1 + 3) Then Layer 2 would be: 3(1 + 3) But wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So maybe I should define it recursively. Let me try to define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is the 9th layer, but actually, the innermost is the 1st, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). So, 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Continuing this way: Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on. The original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So after computing the innermost layers up to Layer 9, which is 29524, we then multiply by 3. So the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so starting from the innermost, I have to compute nine layers. Let me recount: Starting from the innermost (Layer 1): (1+3)=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, if I compute each layer starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 multiplied by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, it's 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, all these steps seem correct. Each layer was computed by taking the previous layer's value, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving to the next layer. It's a recursive process, each time building on the previous result. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which leads to rapid growth. Let me just check one of the layers again to be sure. Let's pick Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4. Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121=363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88,572. Yep, that's right. I think I did this correctly. So, the final answer is 88,572. I guess another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence relation might give a formula, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Alternatively, the general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to confirm it. Using the formula, I can compute each layer directly without computing all previous layers, but since there are only nine layers, computing step by step is manageable. But for larger numbers of layers, the formula would be more efficient. However, in this case, since it's only nine layers, the step-by-step approach works fine. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (this is the innermost part) Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, if I compute each Layer from 1 to 9, I can substitute each result into the next layer. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so far, so good. Let's go to Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so: Total = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Well, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, actually, maybe breaking it down differently would be easier. 29524 * 3: Let's compute digit by digit. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, that seems off because 29524*3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total is 88,572. Let me just double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. So, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost. \n\n1.

Finally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n   - Total: 3(29524) = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems manageable. So, I can compute each layer starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9 and then multiply the result by 3. Let me start computing each layer step by step.\n\n**Layer 1:**\n1 + 3 = 4\n\n**Layer 2:**\n1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n**Layer 3:**\n1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n**Layer 4:**\n1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n**Layer 5:**\n1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n**Layer 6:**\n1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n**Layer 7:**\n1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n**Layer 8:**\n1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n**Layer 9:**\n1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check these calculations because the numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I haven't made any arithmetic mistakes.\n\nStarting again from Layer 1:\n\n**Layer 1:**\n1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\n**Layer 2:**\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n**Layer 3:**\n1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n**Layer 4:**\n1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.

Let me verify 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\n**Layer 8:**\n1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\n**Layer 9:**\n1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, actually, it's better to compute digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nLet's compute:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading from top: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that seems off because 29524*3 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\nCompute units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nTens place: 2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nHundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nThousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\nTen-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nLet me confirm using another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Maybe I should compute the layers again to be 100% certain.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\n1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\n3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\n4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\n5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\n6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\n7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\n8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\n9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly, and then multiplied by 3. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without expanding each layer, but given that it's only nine layers, expanding step by step seems manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Then, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found as follows:\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2 = (59049)/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, this method also confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a geometric series.\n\nWait, each a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution we found is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that formula.\n\nGiven a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nFrom the general solution above, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by expanding each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I start from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's E1.

Wait, that's 88572. Hmm, but when I did it the other way, I got 88572 as well. So, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method to compute 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, same result. So, I think I did it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each step manually, especially since there are nine layers. Perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the expression: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me define E_n as the nth layer, starting from E1 = 1 + 3. Then, E_{n} = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = E_n^{(h)} + E_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E1 = 4.\n\nE1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: E3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: E4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: E5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: E6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: E7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: E8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: E9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for all computed values. Therefore, I can trust this formula.\n\nTherefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both methods\u2014direct computation and finding a closed-form formula\u2014I arrive at the same result, 88572. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the structure of the expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to the expansion of (3)^n, but with an added constant. The formula we derived, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, is consistent with this idea because it's a geometric series sum.\n\nLet me recall that the sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In our case, the recurrence E_n =1 + 3*E_{n-1} can be seen as each term adding 1 and then scaling by 3. So, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but we also add 1 each time.\n\nBut in our case, the formula we derived is E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's see if that aligns with the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, if I consider E_n as the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, that sum is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, no, the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, yes, that's exactly what we have. Therefore, E_n is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n.\n\nWait, but how does that relate to our recurrence? Let me think.\n\nOur recurrence is E_n =1 +3*E_{n-1}, which is similar to building a sum where each term is 1 multiplied by 3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, let's see: If E_n =1 +3*E_{n-1}, then E_n =1 +3*(1 +3*E_{n-2}) =1 +3 +3^2*E_{n-2}, and so on, until E_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. So, indeed, E_n is the sum of a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio 3, up to n+1 terms.\n\nWait, but in our case, E1 was 1 +3 =4, which is 1 +3 =4, which is 3^0 +3^1. Similarly, E2=1 +3*E1=1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13=1 +3 +9=13, which is 3^0 +3^1 +3^2. So, E_n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. So, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*E9 =3*(sum from k=0 to9 of3^k)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nWhich matches our previous result.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is to recognize that the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to9 of3^k)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nThis is a more efficient way, especially if the number of layers is large, as it avoids computing each E_n step by step.\n\nIn summary, by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can compute the result more efficiently. However, since the problem had only nine layers, computing each step manually was manageable, but it's good to know the general formula for future reference.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying using both iterative computation and the geometric series formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By recognizing this as a geometric series, we can compute the sum efficiently.\n\nThe expression can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Each layer \\( E_n \\) follows the recurrence \\( E_n = 1 + 3E_{n-1} \\) with \\( E_1 = 4 \\).\n2. The general solution for \\( E_n \\) is found to be \\( E_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n3. For the outermost layer \\( E_9 \\), we compute \\( E_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n4. The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " I'll number them from the innermost as Layer 1 up to the outermost as Layer 9. Let me see: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3(Layer 2), etc., up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. But wait, the problem as given has 9 layers? Let me count: Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...): 1. Innermost: (1+3) 2. Next: (1+3(1+3)) 3. Then: (1+3(1+3(1+3))) ... up to the 9th layer. So, yes, there are 9 layers. Therefore, I can compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me define each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where each Lk = 1 + 3*L(k-1), starting from L1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but L1 is just (1 + 3), which is 4. Then L2 is 1 + 3*L1, which is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute each step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2: L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the problem is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it as:\n\n29,524\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0.\n\n5 *3=15 \u21925, carry1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29,524 * 3:\n\n30,000 * 3 = 90,000.\n\nBut 29,524 is 30,000 - 476.\n\nSo 90,000 - (476*3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the layers because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 +29,523=29,524. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7: 3*1093. 1000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So 3,000 +270=3,270 +9=3,279. Then 1 +3,279=3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3,280. 3,000*3=9,000; 200*3=600; 80*3=240. So 9,000 +600=9,600 +240=9,840. Then 1 +9,840=9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9,841. Let's compute 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So 27,000 +2,400=29,400 +120=29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 +29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, each layer seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, writing each layer as I go. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I did this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote the value of the nth layer as a_n. Then, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as we computed.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n^(h) = 3*a_{n-1}^(h), which has the solution a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is a_9, since we have 9 layers.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29,524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, using the recurrence relation, and finding a closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next inner term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

That's straightforward. Now, E\u2082 = 1 + 3E\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to E\u2083: E\u2083 = 1 + 3E\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. E\u2084 = 1 + 3E\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's a jump. E\u2085 = 1 + 3E\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. This is increasing rapidly. E\u2086 = 1 + 3E\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, that's almost 1100. E\u2087 = 1 + 3E\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Hmm, that's over 3000 now.

So, let me define each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Substituting Layer 2's value: 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Substituting 40: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). So, 1 + 3*121.

Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Substituting 9841: 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, substituting Layer 9's value: 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final multiplication: 3*29524. Let me verify that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +72 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's the right answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step builds on the previous one, and the numbers seem to be increasing as expected. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result of the given expression.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the value of the previous layer into the next one. Starting with Layer 1 as 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is calculated as 1 + 3 times the previous layer's value. After computing all layers up to Layer 9, the final result is obtained by multiplying Layer 9 by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:**  \n   Compute the innermost expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   Substitute Layer 1 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   Substitute Layer 2 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   Substitute Layer 3 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   Substitute Layer 4 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   Substitute Layer 5 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   Substitute Layer 6 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   Substitute Layer 7 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   Substitute Layer 8 into the next expression:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:**  \n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me assign variables to each layer to make it easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let\u2019s define a base case where there are no more parentheses. So, the innermost expression is just 1 + 3, right? Wait, no, actually, looking again, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and then each layer wraps around that. Let me check: starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on, until we have nine layers. So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So:\n\n- L1 = 1 + 3\n- L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n- L3 = 1 + 3*L2\n- ...\n- L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so yes, that would be 3*L9.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, that's a big number. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's break it down.\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back step by step to ensure each layer is correct.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. So L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. So L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. So L9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3\" in the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the innermost 1+3:\n\nLooking at the expression: Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 (layer 1)\n\nthen 1+3(1+3) (layer 2)\n\nthen 1+3(1+3(1+3)) (layer 3)\n\nand so on, until layer 9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see: Each time I see a \"1+3\", it's a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3\" terms.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times \"1+3\" occurs as a separate term. Let me parse the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3\" is used as a separate term, excluding the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, inside the outermost 3*(...), there are nine instances of \"1+3*...\", each nested deeper.\n\nWait, so perhaps I have eight layers? Because the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...), so from L1 to L9, that's nine layers, but perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each \"1+3\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost, it's L1=1+3, then L2=1+3*L1, up to L9=1+3*L8, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of times \"1+3\" appears, I think it's eight times, because the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, there are eight \"1+3\" terms. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, inside the first 3*(...), there are eight more \"1+3*(...)\" terms. So, that would be eight layers, meaning L1 to L8, and then the outermost is 3*(L8). Wait, but earlier I thought there were nine layers. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer, so:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...)\n3. And so on.\n\nSo, from the initial 3*(...), how many times does \"1+3\" appear as a separate term? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3\" terms inside:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)\n2. Inside that, 1 + 3*(...)\n3. Inside that, 1 + 3*(...)\n4. Inside that, 1 + 3*(...)\n5. Inside that, 1 + 3*(...)\n6. Inside that, 1 + 3*(...)\n7. Inside that, 1 + 3*(...)\n8. Inside that, 1 + 3*(...)\n\nSo, that's eight \"1+3\" terms inside the initial 3*(...), making a total of eight layers, so L1 to L8, and then the outermost is 3*(L8). Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had nine layers, leading to L9. So perhaps I overcounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each time we have a \"1+3\", it's a new layer, starting from the innermost. So, in the problem, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3\" terms inside the initial 3*(...). Let me count them again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 (L1)\n2. 1+3*(L1) (L2)\n3. 1+3*(L2) (L3)\n4. 1+3*(L3) (L4)\n5. 1+3*(L4) (L5)\n6. 1+3*(L5) (L6)\n7. 1+3*(L6) (L7)\n8. 1+3*(L7) (L8)\n9. 1+3*(L8) (L9)\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), which contains eight layers of \"1+3*(...)\", so maybe I have eight layers, making L1 to L8, and then the outermost is 3*(L8). So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by adding an extra layer. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...), and the number of times \"1+3\" appears is nine times, including the innermost. So, perhaps I have nine layers, L1 to L9, with L9 being the outermost layer before the initial 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the expression more carefully. Let me write it out with indices:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, inside the initial 3*(...), there are eight \"1+3*(...)\" terms, which would correspond to layers L1 to L8, with L8 being the innermost. Then, the initial 3*(...) would be 3*(L8). Wait, that can't be, because in my initial computation, I had L1 as the innermost, which would be 1+3, then L2 as 1+3*(L1), etc., up to L9, which would be 1+3*(L8), and then the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, in that case, the problem's expression would have nine layers, with the initial 3*(L9). So, perhaps my initial computation was correct with nine layers, leading to L9=29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"1+3\" terms inside the initial 3*(...), I see eight instances, each starting a new layer, so perhaps the correct number of layers is nine, including the innermost. So, perhaps my initial computation is correct, leading to the final answer of 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again by computing each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nStarting with L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check L9 again because 3*9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. Then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nThe expression is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this using the formula. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThen, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine layers. But when I used the formula, I considered n=9, which gave me a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572. But let me confirm that the number of layers is indeed nine.\n\nLooking back at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3\" is a new layer, starting from the innermost. Let me count the number of \"1+3\" terms inside the initial 3*(...):\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n2.

    "text": " I'll number them from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, to the outermost, which is the 1st layer. So, starting with the 9th layer: Layer 9: 1 + 3 There's nothing inside the parentheses here, just 1 + 3. That's simple. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out to Layer 8: Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 9) Since Layer 9 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 8 = 13. Next, Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Layer 8 is 13, so 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 7 = 40. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 7) Layer 7 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. Let's see: 3*40 = 120, and 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 6 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 6) Layer 6 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 3*120 = 360, and 3*1 = 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 5) Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 4 = 1093. Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 4) Layer 4 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 3 = 3280. Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 3) Layer 3 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 2 = 9841. Finally, Layer 1: 1 + 3(Layer 2) Layer 2 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, and 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 1 = 29524. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 1. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, and 3*4=12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back step by step. Starting from Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each time, we compute the innermost layer first and work our way out. So, if I have nine layers, each time I'm adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems that each layer's result is being multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added in the next layer. So, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Wait, no, actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. But in my earlier calculation, I had Layer 1 as the outermost, which was 1 + 3*Layer 2, and so on. So, perhaps my layers are numbered differently. Let me clarify: If I number the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2 = 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3 = 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on until Layer 9 = 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation, which might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form formula, I still arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the layers, we can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I expand this, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to write it out step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let's denote S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). So, S is the innermost expression, and each time we go out, we add 1 and multiply by 3. Wait, no, actually, S would be the innermost term, but in our case, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*(1 + 3)))), with nine layers. Let me try to express this as a sum. Each layer adds another term in the expansion. Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. The next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. The next is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, it's a recursive sequence, as I thought earlier. Therefore, using the formula I derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which for n=9 gives 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that. If I expand the expression, starting from the innermost, each layer is multiplied by 3 each time we go outward. So, the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4. The next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. The next is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, if I write out the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). Let me try to expand this step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nEntire expression: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculations. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me compute it again using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if I compute Layer 9, then multiply by 3, that would give me the result. Let me structure this:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Because in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my layers again because I might have miscounted. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3. Let me count the opening parentheses: from the innermost, each 1 + 3 is followed by another ( until the end. So, let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as I had before. So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), up to Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can find a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me define L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nWait, but in this case, L1 is 4, L2 is 13, etc. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let me see.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me compute L(1):\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nL(2): (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nL(3): (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n = 9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Because sometimes when you have a recurrence, the indexing can be off. Let me check for n=1,2,3.\n\nn=1: L(1)=4, formula gives (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2)=13, formula gives (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L(3)=40, formula gives (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula seems correct. Therefore, L(9)=29524, and 3*L(9)=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThus, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29524 *3: Let me compute it again. 29524 *3.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 *3 using another method to confirm. Let's compute 30000*3=90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 30000*3=90000, 476*3=1428. So, 90000 -1428=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each 1 + 3 is followed by another ( until the end. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n\n...\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 appears, excluding the outermost 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 1 + 3 terms inside the parentheses. Let me count them:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the 9th layer. So, yes, 9 layers in total. Therefore, L9 is 29524, and 3*L9=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I compute each layer, I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 29524*3 another way. 29524*3:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and everything seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, starting from the innermost: E1 = 1 + 3 Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 E3 = 1 + 3*E2 ... and so on, up to E9. But wait, in the given problem, the outermost term is 3*(...), so actually, the entire expression is 3*E9, where E9 is the outermost layer. Hmm, maybe I should think of each layer as a function of the previous one. Let me try to compute each step carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so E2 is 13. Next layer out, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. So, E3 is 40. Moving out another layer, E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E4 is 121. Next, E5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 121, so E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E5 is 364. Continuing outward, E6 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E6 is 1093. Next, E7 = 1 + 3*E6. E6 is 1093, so E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E7 is 3280. Moving out another layer, E8 = 1 + 3*E7. E7 is 3280, so E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E8 is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer, E9 = 1 + 3*E8. E8 is 9841, so E9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. E9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3*(E9), right?

Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. \n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 equals 4. \n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.

Therefore, Layer 5 is 364.\n\nMoving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 equals 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating that: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Thus, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Therefore, Layer 8 equals 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), which we've now computed as Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by 29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break that down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. \n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication to be sure. Maybe I made a mistake in adding up the parts. Let me try another way: 29524 * 3. \n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nThere's nothing left, so write down 8. So, reading the digits from top to bottom, we get 88572. Yep, that's correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. \n\nWait, but let me just double-check each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake when dealing with so many layers. \n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. Starting from Layer 1:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives the result:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " I'll number them from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. Wait, actually, let me check: each time I see a 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(that), then 1 + 3*(the previous result), and so on until the outermost layer. So, let me start from the innermost and work my way out. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify the innermost expression. Looking at the original problem, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost layer simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from Layer 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so Layer 2 simplifies to 13. Next layer out is again 1 + 3*(result from Layer 2). So, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, Layer 3 is 40. Moving outward, Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(result from Layer 3). So, 1 + 3*40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(121).\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 5 simplifies to 364. Next, Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(364).\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093.\n\nSo, Layer 6 is 1093. Moving outward, Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(1093).\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 first, which is 3000, then 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280.\n\nLayer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(3280).\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841.\n\nSo, Layer 8 is 9841. Now, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(9841).\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524.\n\nSo, Layer 9 simplifies to 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times this result. So, the final computation is 3*(29524).\n\nLet me compute that. 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572, so adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 3 * 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 3 * 2 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n- 3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 3 * 9 = 27, plus 1 carried over is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 3 * 0 (since there's a zero in the ten-thousands place) = 0, plus 2 carried over is 2.\n- 3 * 2 (the next digit) = 6.\n\nWait, no, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That matches my earlier calculation, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, so I think I did it right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or check if there's a pattern that could have been used to solve it without computing each layer.\n\nWait, another approach: notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, maybe this is a recurrence relation, and I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me think about that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches a_1=4. Good.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches Layer 3. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, there are 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches Layer 9. So, the value inside the outermost multiplication is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which again matches.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step layer method and the recurrence relation method gave the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe break down each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost multiplication:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " I'll number them from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9. Wait, actually, looking again, the innermost part is (1+3), so maybe that's Layer 1, then the next one out is Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9. Let me confirm: Starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then that's multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next layer. So, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost. Wait, but in the original problem, the outermost term is 3*(...), so maybe Layer 9 is the innermost (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). Let me make sure I'm counting correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).

The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me do that step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because that seems a bit high. Let me compute 29524 * 3 more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\nSo, yes, 88572. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the layers because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount how many times 1 + 3*(...) occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n\nThen, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3*(, there's a 1 + 3*(...), and each time, that's another layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. ...1 + 3*(...\n3. ...1 + 3*(...\n4. ...1 + 3*(...\n5. ...1 + 3*(...\n6. ...1 + 3*(...\n7. ...1 + 3*(...\n8. ...1 + 3*(...\n9. ...1 + 3*(...\n\nWait, so there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3*(...\" starting from the innermost. So, that means there are 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost (1+3)=4.\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(...). The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"(\" after the first 3( is another layer. Let me count the number of \"(\" after the first 3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n\nThen each subsequent \"(\" is another layer. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, the first \"(\" is the start of Layer 1: (1+3(...). Then each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer. Let me count how many \"(\" there are after the first 3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n10. ...1+3))))) \n\nWait, that can't be right because the original expression has 9 nested layers. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, excluding the last part. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of closing parentheses at the end. The expression ends with ))))))))))), which is 9 closing parentheses, meaning there are 9 layers. So, that means Layer 9 is the innermost, and the outermost is the initial 3*(...). Wait, no, that's not correct. The number of closing parentheses corresponds to the number of layers. So, each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, if there are 9 closing parentheses, that means there are 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost layer is Layer 9, and the outermost is Layer 1. Wait, that would mean I have to start from Layer 9 as (1+3), then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer9), etc., up to Layer1, which is the innermost, and then the outermost is 3*(Layer1). Hmm, that's a different approach. So, maybe I was counting the layers in reverse earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the expression is 3*(Layer1), where Layer1 is 1 + 3*(Layer2), and so on until Layer9 is (1+3). So, starting from Layer9, which is (1+3)=4.\n\nThen Layer8: 1 + 3*Layer9 = 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Layer1=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, and this repeats 8 more times. Wait, no, actually, starting from a_9=4, then a_8=1+3*a_9, etc., up to a_1=1+3*a_2, and then the total is 3*a_1. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_9=4. So, solving this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant D. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Here, a_9 = 4. So, when n=9, a_9 = C*3^{9} - 1/2 = 4.\n\nThus, C*3^9 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo, C = (9/2) / 3^9 = (9/2) / 19683 = (9)/(2*19683) = 9/39366 = 1/4374.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (1/4374)*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, we need to find a_1, which is the result after 8 more layers beyond a_9.\n\nWait, but actually, in our earlier approach, a_1 is the outermost layer, which is the result after 8 layers beyond a_9. Wait, no, actually, we have 9 layers, starting from a_9=4 up to a_1=29524.\n\nSo, to find a_1, we can use n=1, but we need to adjust the indices correctly. Alternatively, since a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2, and we know that a_9=4, so n=9 corresponds to a_9=4.\n\nSo, a_1 would be when n=1, but that might not align correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the number of layers as starting from a_1 being the innermost. Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me try to compute a_1 using the general formula.\n\nWe have a_n = (1/4374)*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nFor n=9, a_9=4, which checks out: (1/4374)*3^9 - 1/2 = (19683/4374) - 1/2 = (4.5) - 0.5 = 4, which is correct.\n\nNow, to find a_1, which is when n=1: a_1 = (1/4374)*3^1 - 1/2 = 3/4374 - 1/2 \u2248 0.000685 - 0.5 \u2248 -0.499315. That can't be right because our earlier computation showed a_1=29524, which is positive. So, perhaps my indexing is off. Maybe the general solution should be adjusted for the correct number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, starting from a_1 as the innermost. So, if a_1 is (1+3)=4, then a_2=1+3*a_1=13, etc., up to a_9 being the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nBut in our earlier approach, we had 9 layers starting from a_9=4 up to a_1=29524, then multiplied by 3. So, perhaps the general formula is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2, where n starts from 1 as the innermost layer.\n\nThus, a_1=4, which would be when n=1: a_1= C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 =4. Solving for C: 3C=4 + 1/2=9/2, so C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1=4 up to a_9=29524. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the general formula, we can compute the result without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost outwards, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1 (innermost):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9 (outermost before multiplication):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:  \n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me denote each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost. So, starting from the inside: E1 = 1 + 3 Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 E3 = 1 + 3*E2 ... and so on, up to E9. Then, the entire expression would be 3*E9. Let me test this approach. Let me compute each E step by step.\n\nFirst, E1 is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, E1 = 4.\n\nNow, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, E2 = 13.\n\nNext, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, E3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. So, E4 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, E5 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let me compute that: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Therefore, E6 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6. E6 is 1093. So, 3*1093 is... let me calculate that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, adding up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, E7 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7. E7 is 3280. So, 3*3280 is... let's compute that. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, E8 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8. E8 is 9841. So, 3*9841 is... let me calculate this carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, E9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Wait, that seems too high. Let me check my multiplication again because 3*29524 should be 88572? Let me do it another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E9. Let me go back through each E step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. So, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So, 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times...))). So, starting from the innermost, I had E1 up to E9, and then multiplied by 3. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each step. Let me think about that. Each step is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = E_n^h + E_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\nE1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: E4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: E5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: E6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: E7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: E8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: E9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, E9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*E9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} =177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again without using the formula, just to confirm.\n\nE1=4\n\nE2=1 +3*4=13\n\nE3=1 +3*13=40\n\nE4=1 +3*40=121\n\nE5=1 +3*121=364\n\nE6=1 +3*364=1093\n\nE7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nE8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nE9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that each time you add a layer, you're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me think about that. Each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. So, starting from E1=4, each subsequent E is built by multiplying the previous by 3 and adding 1. So, E2=1 +3*4=13, E3=1 +3*13=40, etc.\n\nThis is similar to the expansion of (3^{n} -1)/2, which we saw earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) nine times. So, maybe I can express it as a sum.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to stick with the step-by-step computation since the number of layers isn't too large.\n\nAlternatively, I could write the expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLet me try to expand the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nE1 =1 +3 =4\n\nE2=1 +3*E1=1 +3*(4)=13\n\nE3=1 +3*E2=1 +3*13=40\n\nE4=1 +3*E3=1 +3*40=121\n\nE5=1 +3*E4=1 +3*121=364\n\nE6=1 +3*E5=1 +3*364=1093\n\nE7=1 +3*E6=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nE8=1 +3*E7=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nE9=1 +3*E8=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more step manually.\n\nFor example, E7=3280. Let me compute E8 again: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE9=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute 29524*3 again:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n9\u00d73=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method, like breaking down the multiplication:\n\n29524 \u00d73\n\n= (20000 +9000 +500 +20 +4) \u00d73\n\n=20000\u00d73 +9000\u00d73 +500\u00d73 +20\u00d73 +4\u00d73\n\n=60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12\n\n=60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each inner expression as \\( E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_9 \\) where \\( E_1 \\) is the innermost and \\( E_9 \\) is the outermost.

    "text": " Let me assign a variable to each nested expression to make it easier. Let's say: Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me denote the innermost expression as A\u2081, then the next one as A\u2082, and so on, up to A\u2089, since there are nine layers. So, starting from the innermost part: A\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081. A\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082, and so on, until A\u2089. Then the entire expression is 3*A\u2089. Wait, let me confirm. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, yes, each A\u1d62 is 1 + 3*A\u1d62\u208b\u2081, starting from A\u2081 = 1 + 3. So, let me compute each A step by step. Starting with A\u2081: A\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, A\u2082 = 13. Next, A\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, A\u2083 = 40. Moving on to A\u2084: A\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, A\u2084 = 121. Now, A\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 3*121 is 363. Then, 363 + 1 = 364. So, A\u2085 = 364. Next, A\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 = 1093. So, A\u2086 = 1093. Moving on to A\u2087: A\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. So, A\u2087 = 3280. Next, A\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. So, A\u2088 = 9841. Now, A\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, A\u2089 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Wait, maybe breaking it down differently would be better. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3. Let's compute each digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify this with another method to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by breaking it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches the previous result. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each A\u1d62 step. Let me go through each step again quickly:\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nA\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*A\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. Each step seems correct, so I think the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about it. Each A\u1d62 is defined as A\u1d62 = 1 + 3*A\u1d62\u208b\u2081. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for A\u2099 where n is the number of layers. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nA\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, with A\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is A\u2099 - 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3\u207f.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is A\u2099 = C*3\u207f + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, A\u2081=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3\u00b9 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is A\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, A\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1:\n\nA\u2081 = (3\u00b2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nA\u2082 = (3\u00b3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nA\u2083 = (3\u2074 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nA\u2084=(3\u2075 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\nA\u2085=(3\u2076 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\nA\u2086=(3\u2077 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\nA\u2087=(3\u2078 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\nA\u2088=(3\u2079 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\nA\u2089=(3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for n=9, A\u2089=(3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2=29524, as computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to calculate each A\u1d62 step by step. That might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, both methods are manageable.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was unsure at first, computing step by step was a safer approach to avoid mistakes.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each nested expression and verifying each step, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can compute each layer step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form solution to efficiently compute the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(...), repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Define a sequence**: Let A\u2099 represent the value of the nth nested expression, starting from the innermost layer.\n\n3. **Recurrence relation**: Each term is defined as A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, with A\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n4. **Compute each term**:\n   - A\u2081 = 4\n   - A\u2082 = 13\n   - A\u2083 = 40\n   - A\u2084 = 121\n   - A\u2085 = 364\n   - A\u2086 = 1093\n   - A\u2087 = 3280\n   - A\u2088 = 9841\n   - A\u2089 = 29524\n\n5. **General solution**: Using the recurrence relation, derive a formula: A\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2. For n=9, A\u2089 = 29524.\n\n6. **Final computation**: Multiply A\u2089 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " I'll label them from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, which is Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1, we get 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let's compute that: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct result. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern initially, computing each layer step by step is also a valid approach, albeit more time-consuming. It's reassuring that both methods lead to the same answer. I think I've covered all the steps and verified my calculations, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, Layer 1 = 4. **Layer 2:** Now, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, and then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. **Layer 3:** Next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. **Layer 4:** Moving on to Layer 4, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, and 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 = 121. **Layer 5:** Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. Well, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. **Layer 6:** Now, Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. Breaking it down: 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093. **Layer 7:** Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let me do this step by step: 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280. **Layer 8:** Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280. Well, 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841. **Layer 9:** Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. **Final Step:** Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just quickly verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

But actually, looking again, the innermost part is 1 + 3, but it's multiplied by 3 in the next layer. Hmm, maybe I need to compute each layer step by step. Let me try to compute each layer from the inside out. Starting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Let me list each layer clearly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems a bit high. Let me verify each step because I might have made a mistake in multiplication somewhere. Let me go through each layer again carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let's compute that: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524  \n*       3  \n________  \nCompute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.  \n2*3=6 +1=7.  \n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.  \n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.  \n2*3=6 +2=8.  \nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3=4, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So yes, Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach works. For example, if the expression was just 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), how would that compute?\n\nLet's compute that smaller version:\n\nStart with innermost: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nOutermost: 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, computing step by step:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))  \n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))  \n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 12))  \n= 3(1 + 3*13)  \n= 3(1 + 39)  \n= 3*40  \n= 120.\n\nYes, that works. So applying the same method to the larger problem should be correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the result to be 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer (Layer 1)**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\n4. **Final Multiplication**:\n   - The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Let me go back through each layer step by step to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or some recursive pattern, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the simplest approach. Alternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation where each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let's see, if I let a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, it seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n without computing each term. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for a_9, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or reasoning. Each step builds on the previous one, and the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. So, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Hmm, that might be a good approach. Let me try computing each layer step by step. Let's start with Layer 1.\n\n**Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that was straightforward. Layer 1 is 4.\n\n**Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\n**Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\n3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40.\n\n**Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\n**Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\n**Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364 is... let me compute that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\n**Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\n**Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\n3*3280: Let me compute this. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\n**Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nNow, 3*9841: Let's compute this. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nWait, actually, breaking it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 another way to confirm.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but given the small number of layers (nine), computing each step manually is feasible. However, if there were more layers, a formula might be more efficient. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 1 + 3*13\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 1 + 3*40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like each layer is following the recurrence relation:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nWith L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the numbers get large quickly, I think computing each layer step by step is manageable here.\n\nAlternatively, I can express L(n) as L(n) = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, let me test this.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIf I have L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nLet me compute L(2):\n\nL(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nIf I plug n=2 into (3^2 - 1)/2: (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which is not 13. So that formula doesn't hold.\n\nWait, perhaps another formula. Let me try to find the closed-form solution for this recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 3*L_p + 1\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nL(4)=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nGiven that, since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Good, so that's consistent.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, both methods work.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). If I expand the entire expression, it would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try expanding it step by step, although that might get messy.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStart with 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, perhaps it's best to stick with the step-by-step computation or the closed-form formula.\n\nGiven that, I think I've confirmed the result in multiple ways, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer starting from the innermost part:\n\n- **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let's define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1, I can build up to the final answer. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 is... let me compute that. 9841*3. Well, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original problem is 3*(Layer 9). Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 9. So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but maybe I should check the multiplication again.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the structure of the problem. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, and then adding 1 again, and so on. So each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So my approach of computing each layer step by step seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, since each layer is similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula that represents each layer.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think: Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = D, where D is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) =88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the final result is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. That matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's a good check.\n\nSo, to summarize, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I arrived at the final value of 88572. Additionally, by recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation, I confirmed that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost, we find the final result to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Okay, moving on.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nHmm, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, a\u2085 is 364.\n\nThen, a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12, so 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, a\u2086 is 1093.\n\nNext, a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, a\u2087 is 3280.\n\nMoving on, a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, a\u2088 is 9841.\n\nNow, a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, a\u2089 is 29524.\n\nWait, let me double-check that computation because 3*9841 is a big number. Let me compute it another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me break down 9841 into 9000 + 800 + 40 + 1, then multiply each by 3:\n\n- 3*9000 = 27000\n- 3*800 = 2400\n- 3*40 = 120\n- 3*1 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nSo, now, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- 3*20000 = 60000\n- 3*9000 = 27000\n- 3*500 = 1500\n- 3*20 = 60\n- 3*4 = 12\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that because sometimes breaking it down can lead to errors. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I did it the other way, I got 88572, which matches, so that's good.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies down to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my a_i computations because if I messed up any step, the final answer would be wrong. Let me go through each a_i again to double-check.\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after carefully going through each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the structure, each a_i is defined as a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a\u2081 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_i = c + r*a_{i-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The general solution is a_i = (c*r^{i} - c)/(r - 1). Let me verify that.\n\nWait, actually, the standard solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_i = r*a_{i-1} + c is a_i = r^{i}*(a\u2080) + c*(r^{i} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, perhaps I should derive it.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence: a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies a_i = 3*a_{i-1}, which has the solution a_i^{(h)} = A*3^{i}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_i^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_i = A*3^{i} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4. So, when i=1, a\u2081 = 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^{i} - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for i=1: a\u2081 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor i=2: a\u2082 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor i=3: a\u2083 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have a\u2089, which is the 9th term in this sequence. So, a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula approach also gives the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each a_i is following a geometric progression and used the formula directly without computing each term, which might have saved time, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad.\n\nIn summary, by either iteratively computing each nested expression or by recognizing the pattern and applying the formula for the linear recurrence, I arrived at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by recognizing the repeating pattern and work from the innermost parentheses outward. We define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one:\n\n1. Define \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n2. Compute each subsequent term using the recurrence relation \\( a_i = 1 + 3a_{i-1} \\).\n\nWe compute each term step by step:\n\n- \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we compute the entire expression by multiplying the outermost term by 3:\n\n- \\( 3a_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me denote each innermost expression as E1, then E2, all the way up to E9, where E9 is the outermost expression. But actually, since each layer is similar, maybe I can compute them step by step without needing to label each one. Let's try that. Starting from the innermost part: The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, and then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so the second innermost layer gives us 13. Moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, and then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer gives us 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here, maybe? Let me see if I can find a formula or a way to generalize this. Each time, we're computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I denote each step as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each term step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about solving this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying this, we can write it as a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer, the value is given by a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me see: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Yes, that's another way to write it. So, for each layer, starting from the innermost (which is n=1), each subsequent layer increments n by 1. Since there are nine layers, the outermost expression is a_9. So, let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. I know that 3^5 = 243, so 3^10 = (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243*243. Hmm, 243*200 = 48,600, 243*40 = 9,720, and 243*3 = 729. Adding them together: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320; 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. So, 3^{10} = 59,049. Therefore, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. So, the value of the innermost nine layers is 29,524. But wait, the original problem is 3 times that expression, right? Let me check the original problem again: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, actually, the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the result of the innermost expression. Wait, hold on. Let me clarify. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*a_1 = a_2 = 13. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = a_n. So, the outermost expression is a_9, which is 29,524. But the entire original expression is 3*a_9. Wait, no. Let me parse the original expression correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, that's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), where the innermost part is 1 + 3. So, the outermost operation is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the value of the inner expression. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, that's 3*(a_9), because a_9 is the value of the inner expression starting from 1 + 3. Wait, but when I computed a_9, I included the initial 1 + 3*... So, is the original expression 3*a_9 or a_10? Let me see. Let me try to index the expressions properly. Let me denote E1 as the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 40. And so on, up to E9 = 1 + 3*E8. Then the original expression is 3*E9. So, the value we're looking for is 3*E9. Since E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524, then the original expression is 3*29,524. Let me compute that: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000*3 = 60,000; 9,000*3 = 27,000; 500*3 = 1,500; 24*3 = 72. Adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify this because I might have confused the layers. Let me recount: The innermost layer is E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093. E7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280. E8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841. E9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524. Then the original expression is 3*E9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then 3*a_9 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer manually step by step, in case I made a mistake in the formula. Starting from the innermost: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. E7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. E8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. E9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Then the original expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that's consistent with the formula method. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I had not noticed the pattern and tried to compute each layer step by step without a formula, I would have arrived at the same result. It's always good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially with nested expressions that can get quite large quickly. So, in summary, by recognizing the recursive pattern and solving the recurrence relation, I was able to find a formula that allowed me to compute the value of the innermost expression efficiently, and then multiplied it by 3 to get the final result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Let me number them from the inside out. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is the ninth layer. Then, moving outward, each layer wraps around the previous one with another 1 + 3(...). Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n... and so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nBut wait, actually, looking back at the original problem, the expression starts with 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So, maybe I should think of each layer as being inside another multiplication by 3. Let me try to parse the structure correctly. Let's see: the entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (...))). So, each time, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which suggests that each layer is 3*(previous layer). Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my approach. Let me try to compute each nested part step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer is 3*(4) = 12. Then, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 12 = 13. Then, the next layer is 3*(13) = 39. Then, next layer: 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Next, 1 + 120 = 121. Then, 3*121 = 363. Next, 1 + 363 = 364. Then, 3*364 = 1092. Next, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then, 3*1093 = 3279. Next, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then, 3*3280 = 9840. Finally, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then, 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check my steps again because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is the last set of parentheses, that's the first layer. Then, each time we move outward, we add another layer. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3)\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n4. 3*(1 + ...)\n5. (1 + 3*(...))\n6. 3*(1 + ...)\n7. (1 + 3*(...))\n8. 3*(1 + ...)\n9. (1 + 3*(...))\n10. 3*(1 + ...)\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), each multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, layer 8: 3*(4) = 12.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(13) = 39.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(40) = 120.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(121) = 363.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, but the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), so after layer 1, we have 3*(364) = 1092.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted. Let me try to list each step clearly, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me number the innermost parentheses as step 1, then work outward.\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Compute the next layer: 3*(Step 1 result) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nStep 3: Compute (1 + Step 2 result) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 4: Compute 3*(Step 3 result) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nStep 5: Compute (1 + Step 4 result) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 6: Compute 3*(Step 5 result) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nStep 7: Compute (1 + Step 6 result) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 8: Compute 3*(Step 7 result) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nStep 9: Compute (1 + Step 8 result) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 10: Compute 3*(Step 9 result) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine layers, so perhaps I have an extra step here. Let me check the original problem again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is the ninth layer, and then each layer is 3*(...). So, perhaps the correct way is to have eight multiplications by 3, since the outermost is 3*(...). Let me try again, counting each layer correctly.\n\nLet me consider each nested part as follows:\n\nStart with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 3*(previous result). So:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092.\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3*(...), each multiplied by 3. So, perhaps the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), which would be Layer 10. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds a 3*(...) and a 1. Let me try to compute step by step, starting from the innermost:\n\nCompute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, moving outward: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but that seems too many steps. Let me recount how many times I'm doing this. Each time I go outward, I'm adding another layer. The original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3*(...)), so I should have nine layers. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check my calculations again. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in the number of layers. Let me try a different approach. Let me define each step more carefully.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me denote a_1 as the innermost expression.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but when I first thought through it, I got 29523, but now I'm getting 88572. I must have miscounted earlier. Let me check the original problem again to make sure I'm computing the right number of layers.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, counting the number of 1+3(...), starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to nine times.\n\nSo, a_1 is (1+3) =4.\n\na_2 is 1 +3*4=13.\n\na_3=1+3*13=40.\n\na_4=1+3*40=121.\n\na_5=1+3*121=364.\n\na_6=1+3*364=1093.\n\na_7=1+3*1093=3280.\n\na_8=1+3*3280=9841.\n\na_9=1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 29523, but that was when I didn't multiply by the outermost 3. So, perhaps the correct answer is 88572. But let me check this again step by step to be sure.\n\nCompute a_1: 1 +3=4.\n\na_2: 1 +3*4=13.\n\na_3:1 +3*13=40.\n\na_4:1 +3*40=121.\n\na_5:1 +3*121=364.\n\na_6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\na_7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\na_8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\na_9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me verify this with a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help me compute this without manually calculating each step, especially since this could be time-consuming and prone to error.\n\nI notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for this recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought the answer was 29523, I was only computing a_9, not multiplying by the outermost 3. So, 3*a_9 is indeed 88572.\n\nLet me just confirm once more by computing a few layers with the formula.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nThus, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, if I compute Layer 1 through Layer 9 step by step, I can find the value of the entire expression. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that was simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So substituting Layer 1:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 4 is 121. Now Layer 5:\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5 is 364. Layer 6:\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6 is 1093. Layer 7:\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7 is 3280. Layer 8:\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.

Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so let's compute that:\n\nTotal expression: 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up:\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. Sometimes when I break it down, I might make a mistake in the addition.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 step by step:\n\n3 * 20,000 = 60,000\n3 * 9,000 = 27,000\n3 * 500 = 1,500\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nAdding these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers, let me go back and check each layer's computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2705\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2705\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2705\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2705\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2705\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2705\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2705\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2705\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2705\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2705\n\nHmm, all the layers check out. So, I think I did this correctly. It's a bit tedious, but since each step depends on the previous one, it's crucial to compute each layer accurately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nLet me consider the recursive formula:\n\nLayer 1 = 4\n\nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, each Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = r*a_{n-1} + c\n\nWhere r is the common ratio and c is the constant term.\n\nIn this case, r = 3 and c = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} + c/(1 - r)\n\nWait, let me recall the standard solution for a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - r*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{hom} = A*r^n.\n\nThen, a particular solution can be found. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (c=1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{part} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = r*K + c\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r)\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*r^1 + c/(1 - r)\n\nPlugging in r=3 and c=1:\n\n4 = A*3 + 1/(1 - 3) = 3A + 1/(-2) = 3A - 1/2\n\nSo,\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2705\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2705\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2705\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2705\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2705\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2705\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2705\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2705\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2705\n\nPerfect! The formula works for each layer. So, Layer n is indeed (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the innermost layer, Layer 1, is 4, and Layer 9 is 29524, as I computed earlier.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me see if I can compute the total expression using the formula as well. Since the expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, then:\n\nTotal expression = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, using the formula, I can directly compute the total expression without having to calculate each layer. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is defined recursively. By recognizing the pattern, I could derive a formula to compute the value of each layer, which saved me from manually computing each one step by step. This approach is not only faster but also reduces the chance of making arithmetic errors.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the derived formula\u2014give the same result. So, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me denote each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work my way out, computing each step as I go. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let's identify the innermost expression. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. So, let's compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let's compute that.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so now we have 13 as the result for the second layer. Moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 13. Let me compute that.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so that's 40. Let's keep going.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Got it.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I'm computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this outermost result, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing up to 29524, which is the result of the innermost expression, each layer outwards multiplies by 3 and adds 1, but the very outermost layer is multiplied by 3. Wait, no. Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, when I computed up to 29524, that's the result of the innermost expression, but each layer is built upon that. Wait, no, the innermost is (1+3), which is 4, then each layer outwards is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after 9 layers, the outermost expression is 1 + 3*(result of the 8th layer). Then, the entire expression is 3 times that outermost result. So, let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: The first 3 is outside, then inside it's 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). Each time, it's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) [That's the first layer inside the first 3]\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think that each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each time we go out, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n\nThen, moving out, we have 1 + 3*(4) = 13 (Layer 2)\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(13) = 40 (Layer 3)\n\n1 + 3*(40) = 121 (Layer 4)\n\n1 + 3*(121) = 364 (Layer 5)\n\n1 + 3*(364) = 1093 (Layer 6)\n\n1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 (Layer 7)\n\n1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 (Layer 8)\n\n1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), so yes, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was the result of 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside. So, each time, we compute each layer, starting from the innermost. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so yes, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nNow, let me compute 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n- 2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8\n- 0*3=0\n- 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8\n\nWait, maybe it's better to do it step by step.\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carryover 0\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 0\n\nThe next digit is 9 (from 29524, which is 2 9 5 2 4). Wait, no, 29524 is 2 digits: 2,9,5,2,4. Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from units:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 (tens) *3 =6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n\n5 (hundreds)*3=15 \u21925, carryover1\n\n9 (thousands)*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2\n\n2 (ten thousands)*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carryover0\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524*3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add them:\n\n29524\n\n+29524\n\n=59048\n\nThen, 59048 +29524.\n\n59048 +29524:\n\nAdding units: 8 +4=12 \u21922, carryover1\n\nTens:4 +2=6 +1=7 \u21927\n\nHundreds:0 +5=5\n\nThousands:9 +9=18 \u21928, carryover1\n\nTen thousands:5 +2=7 +1=8\n\nSo, 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nWait, hold on. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12 \u2192900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093.\n\n1093 *3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9 \u21923000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280.\n\n3280 *3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0 \u21929000+600=9600 +240=9840. So, 1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841. Compute 3*9841.\n\n9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3 \u219227000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So, 1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check the original problem again. It says: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of layers is 9, right? Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and there are nine of them, starting from the innermost (1+3). So, that would mean that after computing Layer9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then moving out, each time we have another 1+3(...). Let me count:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 Layer1\n2. 1+3(1+3) \u2192 Layer2\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer3\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u2192 Layer4\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) \u2192 Layer5\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u2192 Layer6\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u2192 Layer7\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 Layer8\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2192 Layer9\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, each time, we compute Layer1 to Layer9, and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, after computing Layer9 as 29524, I multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29524*3=88572. Let me confirm that with another method.\n\n29524*3: 29524 +29524=59048; 59048 +29524=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3*A = 1 \u2192 -2A=1 \u2192 A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.

    "text": " Let me number them from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. Wait, actually, starting from the innermost, which is the last one, so maybe Layer 1 is the innermost and Layer 9 is the outermost. Let me try that. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) Wait, no, that's not right because each layer is 1 plus 3 times another layer. So, perhaps each layer is built from the previous one. Let me think again. Maybe it's better to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. So, let's consider the innermost part first. The innermost expression is 1 + 3(...). Wait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left, I see 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), so each time there's a new (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times this happens. Let's see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of layers. The first layer is 3(...), then inside that is another 3(...), and so on. So, how many 3s are there? Let me see: 3, then 3, then 3, up to the ninth one. Wait, no, actually, each 3 is part of a term, so perhaps there are nine layers. Let me check by counting the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time there's a new opening parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, actually, I think there are nine layers because each 3 is followed by a new (1 + 3(...)), and this happens nine times. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I should index the layers from the innermost to the outermost. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, starting from Layer 1, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write this down:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each Layer computation was correct. Let me go through each layer again quickly to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me verify Layer 8 again because 3*3280 is 9840, right? 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. So, Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct.\n\nThen 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 is 29,524.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just think again if I've counted the layers correctly. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), which is another layer. Let me count how many times I have (1 + 3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = Layer 2.\n\n3. Then, (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = Layer 3.\n\nContinuing this way, up to Layer 9.\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers, each building upon the previous one. Therefore, the computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or follows a pattern that can be expressed recursively.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each layer step by step as I did earlier is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have nine layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, both methods, step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula, give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute this another way. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula approach to verify the result. I also double-checked each layer's computation to ensure there were no arithmetic errors. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

    "text": " I'll number them from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9, with Layer 9 being the outermost. Let's see:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)  \n... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n\nWait, but looking back, the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so actually, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 times something). So, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Hmm, perhaps I should adjust my numbering to include the outermost 3 as Layer 10? Or maybe just keep it as 9 layers, with each layer being the inner expression, and then the final result is 3 times Layer 9. Let me clarify. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So starting from the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent 3 adds another layer. Let me count them: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, total layers from inner to outer: Layer 1: 1 + 3  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n...  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)  \nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, I can compute Layer 1 through Layer 9, each time using the result from the previous layer, and then multiply the final result by 3. That seems manageable. Let's start computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3  \nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nWe just found Layer 1 is 4, so 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \nLayer 2 is 13, so 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)  \nLayer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)  \nLayer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)  \nLayer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)  \nLayer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)  \nLayer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)  \nLayer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524:  \nFirst, 29524 * 3.  \nLet me break it down:  \n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3  \n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3  \n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12  \nNow, adding them up:  \n60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524  \n\u00d7     3  \n-------  \nLet's compute digit by digit from right to left:  \n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.  \n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.  \n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.  \n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.  \n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.  \nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me just go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a layer which propagates the error through all subsequent layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f  \nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLooks like each step checks out. So, I think the final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could represent this.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4. This seems like a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n, which would allow me to compute it without going through each step.\n\nLet me try to model this recursion. Let's define Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer(n-1) = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C  \nC - 3C = 1  \n-2C = 1  \nC = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)  \n4 = 3A - 1/2  \n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f  \nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works for each layer. So, Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3  \n3^2=9  \n3^3=27  \n3^4=81  \n3^5=243  \n3^6=729  \n3^7=2187  \n3^8=6561  \n3^9=19683  \n3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 = (3^10 -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's see: 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572.\n\nSame result. So, another way to compute it is (3^11 -3)/2, which is 88572.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding all the terms, but that might be tedious. Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I expand each term, it's equivalent to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nBut as I saw earlier, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, so expanding it all would just lead to the same computation as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize that this expression is similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added 1 each time. So, it's not a standard geometric series because of the added 1s. However, the recursive formula we found earlier allows us to compute it efficiently.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3 times the previous plus 1.\n\nWait, actually, no. Wait, in the formula Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a linear transformation: each step is scaling by 3 and then adding 1. So, the entire process is a linear recurrence, which we've already solved.\n\nBut just to confirm, let's compute Layer 1 through Layer 9 again using the formula:\n\nLayer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nSo,\n\nLayer 1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4  \nLayer 2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13  \nLayer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40  \nLayer 4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121  \nLayer 5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364  \nLayer 6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093  \nLayer 7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280  \nLayer 8: (3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841  \nLayer 9: (3^10 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nYep, all correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and the repeating pattern.\n2. Start computing from the innermost layer, working outward.\n3. After computing each layer, use its result to compute the next layer.\n4. Once all layers are computed, multiply the outermost layer by 3.\n5. Verify each step to ensure accuracy.\n6. Optionally, derive a closed-form formula to compute the result directly, which corroborates the step-by-step computation.\n\nThis methodical approach helps prevent errors and ensures that each part of the expression is handled correctly. It's easy to see how a single miscalculation in one layer could throw off all subsequent layers, so careful step-by-step computation is essential here.\n\nAnother thing to note is the exponential growth of the values. Each layer is growing by a factor of 3, which is why the numbers increase so rapidly. This is a characteristic of expressions with repeated multiplication, leading to very large results even with a moderate number of layers.\n\nIn summary, breaking down the problem into manageable layers and computing each step methodically leads to the correct solution. It's a good example of how recognizing patterns and using recursive relationships can simplify what initially appears to be a complex problem.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final value.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let's define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s say the innermost part is Layer 1: 1 + 3 Then Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) And so on, up to Layer 9, which would be the outermost one, and then multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, perhaps I should compute Layer 1 first, then Layer 2 using Layer 1's result, and so on until I reach Layer 9, and then multiply that by 3. Let me try that. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. Well, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify that multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should write it out vertically:\n\n     29524\n   x      3\n   --------\n     88572\n\nYes, that's correct. 29524 multiplied by 3 is indeed 88572. So, all my steps check out, and I didn't make any calculation errors. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me number them from the innermost to the outermost. So, the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 is 3*(Layer1), Layer 3 is 1 + Layer2, Layer 4 is 3*(Layer3), and so on. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of each layer as a separate expression. Let me try that. Let me denote each innermost expression as a variable. Let me define a sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let's say a\u2081 = 1 + 3. Then a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081. Then a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082, and so on, up to a\u2089. Then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089. That might be a good approach because it breaks down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. So, let's compute each a\u2081 through a\u2089 step by step. Starting with a\u2081: a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving on to a\u2082: a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081. Since a\u2081 is 4, then a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that's 13. Next, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082. a\u2082 is 13, so a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, 40. Continuing, a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083. a\u2083 is 40, so a\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, 121? That seems like a big jump, but okay. Let's proceed. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084. a\u2084 is 121, so a\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Wow, that's getting large. Next, a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085. a\u2085 is 364, so a\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Okay, 1093. Then a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086. a\u2086 is 1093, so a\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. That's a big number. Moving on, a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087. a\u2087 is 3280, so a\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Wow, that's almost 10,000. Finally, a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088. a\u2088 is 9841, so a\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let me calculate that: 9841 * 3. 9000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So a\u2089 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089, so that would be 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3*a\u2089 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me verify that I didn't make any calculation errors along the way, because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication. Let me go through each step again to check. Starting with a\u2081: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. a\u2082: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. a\u2083: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. a\u2084: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. a\u2085: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. a\u2086: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. a\u2087: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. a\u2088: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. a\u2089: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Finally, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29,524. Let me compute that again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern that allows me to compute it without calculating each term individually. Let me explore that possibility because it might be a more efficient method and could also help verify my answer. Looking at the sequence a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083, ..., a\u2089, each term is defined by the recurrence relation a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a\u2099. The general solution for such a recurrence is a\u2099 = C*3\u207f + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find C and D. When n=1, a\u2081=4: 4 = C*3\u00b9 + D = 3C + D. When n=2, a\u2082=13: 13 = C*3\u00b2 + D = 9C + D. Now, we have a system of equations: 3C + D = 4, 9C + D = 13. Let's subtract the first equation from the second: (9C + D) - (3C + D) = 13 - 4 => 6C = 9 => C = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute C back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + D = 4 => 9/2 + D = 4 => D = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the closed-form solution is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2. Simplifying, that's a\u2099 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a\u2081 = (3\u00b2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a\u2082 = (3\u00b3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a\u2083 = (3\u2074 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3\u00b9\u2070 is 3^10. I know that 3^5=243, so 3^10=(3^5)^2=243^2. Let me compute 243^2. 243*243. Let me compute that: 200*200=40,000, but that's not the right way. Wait, 243*243. Let me compute it step by step. 243*200=48,600. 243*40=9,720. 243*3=729. Now, add them together: 48,600 + 9,720 = 58,320; 58,320 + 729 = 59,049. So, 3^10=59,049. Therefore, a\u2089=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a\u2089=29,524. Then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089=3*29,524=88,572, which is the same as before. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result, which gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this step by step, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, since each a\u2099 is 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, and we've already found a closed-form expression, perhaps that's the most efficient way. But just to explore, let me consider expanding the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let me write out each step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis matches what I got earlier, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach.\n\nEach term inside the parentheses is 1 plus 3 times another term. So, if I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try to see if this forms a geometric series.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But notice that the inner expression is similar to E, except it's missing the outermost 3*(...). Wait, no, not exactly. Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(next term). So, perhaps I can express E in terms of itself. Let me try that.\n\nWait, but in this case, the expression is finite, with nine layers. So, it's not an infinite series, but a finite nested expression. So, perhaps using the closed-form formula is better than trying to express it as an infinite series.\n\nBut for completeness, let me see if I can model it as a finite geometric series.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me see.\n\nIf I consider each layer as a term in the series, then each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, perhaps the sum S = a\u2081 + a\u2082 + ... + a\u2089, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, considering the recursive formula a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, which we've already solved, so perhaps that's the most straightforward approach.\n\nIn any case, I've computed the value step by step, checked it using a closed-form formula, and both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and define a sequence a\u2099 where each term depends on the previous one.\n\n2. Compute each a\u2099 from a\u2081 to a\u2089.\n\n3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula for a\u2099 and compute a\u2089 directly.\n\n4. Multiply the final a\u2089 by 3 to get the result.\n\nBoth methods led to the same answer, 88,572, so I'm confident that's the correct solution.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and defining a sequence \\(a_n\\) where each term depends on the previous one. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define the sequence \\(a_n\\) as follows:\n- \\(a_1 = 1 + 3\\)\n- \\(a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) for \\(n \\geq 2\\)\n\nWe compute each term step by step:\n\n1. \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. \\(a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. \\(a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. \\(a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. \\(a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3a_9\\):\n\n\\[ 3a_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
