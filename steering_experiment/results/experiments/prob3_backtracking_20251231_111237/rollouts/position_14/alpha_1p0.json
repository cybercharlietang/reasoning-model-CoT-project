    "text": " Let me number them from the inside out. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 3 times the next layer. So, maybe I can denote each layer as follows: Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward. Let me write this down.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, that would be:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 times 29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me check if I computed each layer correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check that again because sometimes when you do a lot of steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3 another way. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\n3 * 4 = 12\n\nNow, add all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, 3 * 29524 is indeed 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern, to confirm the result.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(the next layer). Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series or something similar. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which we found to be 29524.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works for the first few layers. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, which is Layer 9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can express the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. But in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit different, but the closed-form solution we found earlier still applies.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and verifying with a closed-form formula, we arrived at the result of 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different methods (step-by-step computation and closed-form formula) both lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward and verifying with a closed-form formula, the result is found to be 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next nested term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Coefficient:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 (since it's the innermost) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... and so on up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, that might be a better way to approach it. So, starting from Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That was easy. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Okay, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*524 = 1572. Wait, maybe it's easier to do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27. Wait, that seems messy. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers.

Then, 3*29524=88572, as I computed earlier. So, I think I did it correctly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, maybe the structure is:\n\nTotal expression = 3 * E9, where E9 = 1 + 3*E8, and E8 = 1 + 3*E7, etc., down to E1 = 1 + 3.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can compute each E starting from E1 and moving outward. So, E1 is the innermost: E1 = 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, that was easy.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each E is defined as E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for E_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is E_n = a + b*E_{n-1}, where a=1 and b=3 in this case.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The solution for such a recurrence is E_n = C*b^{n} + (a/(b-1)), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, let me recall: For a recurrence relation like E_n = a + b*E_{n-1}, the solution is E_n = (a*b^{n} - a)/(b - 1). Wait, maybe I should double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution comes from solving E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution E_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (a=1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, E1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nGiven that, since we have 9 layers, E9 would correspond to n=9.\n\nSo, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nThis confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(E9), and E9 is (3^{10}-1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( E_n = 1 + 3E_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( E_1 = 4 \\). Using this recurrence relation, each subsequent \\( E_n \\) is calculated until \\( E_9 \\), which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Innermost Expression:**\n   - Start with \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Subsequent Layer:**\n   - \\( E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( E_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply the Outermost Layer by 3:**\n   - Total expression = \\( 3 \\times E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me define each part as follows: Let\u2019s denote the innermost expression as A1, then moving outward as A2, A3, up to A9. So, A1 = 1 + 3. Then A2 = 1 + 3*A1. A3 = 1 + 3*A2, and so on, until A9 = 1 + 3*A8. Then the entire expression is 3*A9. Wait, but in the original problem, the outermost term is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, actually, A1 is the innermost, and each subsequent A is built by 1 + 3*A_previous. So, starting from A1, let's compute each step. A1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, A2 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that's 13. Next, A3 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's 40. A4 = 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That's correct. A5 = 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 363 + 1 = 364. So, A5 is 364. Moving on to A6 = 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 = 1093. So, A6 is 1093. Next, A7 = 1 + 3*A6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. So, A7 is 3280. A8 = 1 + 3*A7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. So, A8 is 9841. Finally, A9 = 1 + 3*A8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, A9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*A9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, because this seems like a big number and I want to be accurate. Starting from A1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. A2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. A3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. A4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. A5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. A6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. A7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. A8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. A9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that this expression is a geometric series. Let me see. Each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each time, it's 1 + 3*A_previous. So, starting from A1 = 4, A2 = 13, A3 = 40, etc. So, each term is 1 + 3*A_previous. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for An. The recurrence is An = 1 + 3*A(n-1), with A1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for An. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving An - 3*A(n-1) = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the equation: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is An = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition A1 = 4. So, when n=1, A1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is An = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. So, An = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: A1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: A2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, A9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*A9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By breaking down each layer from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we can systematically compute each step. Using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution confirms the result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, actually, maybe I should work from the innermost outwards, so perhaps starting with the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? So that's 1 + 3, which is 4. Let's compute that first. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, the next layer out is 13.

Next layer: A\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: A\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: A\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: A\u2089 = 1 + 3*A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but the original problem is 3*(A\u2089), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing A\u2089 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because 29524 * 3. Maybe I should compute it directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly. Because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. Let me go back through each step to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. A\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\n2. A\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. A\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. A\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. A\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. A\u2086 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 \u00d7 3: 300\u00d73=900, 60\u00d73=180, 4\u00d73=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. A\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 \u00d7 3. 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. A\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280 \u00d7 3: 3000\u00d73=9000, 280\u00d73=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. A\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 \u00d7 3: 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nThen layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(layer2)\n\nAnd so on, until we have 9 layers because each time we add another (1 + 3(...)), and the original expression has 9 such layers after the initial 3*(...).\n\nWait, but when I computed A\u2081 to A\u2089, that was 9 layers, each corresponding to one of these. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the computation of each A_i. Let me go through each step again:\n\n1. A\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. A\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. A\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. A\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. A\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. A\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. A\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. A\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. A\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again just to be sure. Maybe I can compute it another way.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as:\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n3 \u00d7 5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n3 \u00d7 9 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n3 \u00d7 2 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the final answer is 3*29524, which is 88,572. So, that should be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach time, we have an expression of the form 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as A_n = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}, with A_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is A_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nSo, let's solve A_n = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is A_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume A_n^{(p)} = D, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1\n\n-2D = 1\n\nD = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is A_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition A_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, A_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2\n\nSo, 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u2192 9/2 = 3C \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is A_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: A_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: A\u2081 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: A\u2082 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: A\u2083 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: A\u2084 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: A\u2085 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: A\u2086 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: A\u2087 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: A\u2088 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: A\u2089 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, using the formula, A_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, A\u2089 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A\u2089 = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since A\u2089 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*A\u2089 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThus, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. That's a more efficient way, especially if the number of layers is large, but in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing step by step wasn't too bad.\n\nIn summary, the problem required computing a deeply nested expression with a repeating pattern. By recognizing the recurrence relation and either computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula, we arrived at the final answer of 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we can compute each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). After computing each layer, we multiply the final result by 3.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88,572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me define each part as follows: Let\u2019s denote each innermost expression as E1, then moving outward as E2, E3, and so on up to E9. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nAnd so on, until E9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(...), so yes, that would be 3*E9.\n\nBut let me check the problem again. It's 3(1 + 3(...)). So, if I work from the innermost, each step would be 1 + 3*(previous step). Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4. So, E1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one step out, we have 1 + 3*(E1). So that's 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, E2 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(E2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. E3 = 40.\n\nContinuing outward: E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, E6 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. E7 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. E8 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. E9 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E9, so 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems pretty big. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9841 is 9000 + 800 + 40 + 1. So, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding all together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n24 * 3 = 72.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count:\n\nFrom the innermost: 1+3 is the first layer, then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds another. Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3(, there are 8 more 1+3( expressions. Wait, let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the first 1+3(...):\n\n1. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2014 that's the first layer, E1.\n\nThen, inside that, another 1+3(...), so E2.\n\nContinuing, each time, so how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3( in the entire expression.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3(1+3(...)), so the first 1+3 is the innermost, then each layer adds another. Let me count the number of 1+3( after the initial 3(...)).\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me parse the expression properly.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3 is a layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nFrom the innermost, the first 1+3 is 1+3, then each next is 1+3(...), so how many?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...):\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3( occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3(1+3(...))\n2. 1+3(1+3(...))\n3. 1+3(1+3(...))\n4. 1+3(1+3(...))\n5. 1+3(1+3(...))\n6. 1+3(1+3(...))\n7. 1+3(1+3(...))\n8. 1+3(1+3(...))\n9. 1+3(...)\n\nWait, so starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of 1+3( after the initial 3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each time we have a 1+3(...), it's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, so let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is E1.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1+3*(E1) = E2.\n\nThen, 1+3*(E2) = E3.\n\nContinuing until E9, which would be the outermost layer before the final 3*(E9).\n\nWait, but in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is 1+3*(E8).\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I had E1 to E9, each being 1+3*(previous). So, that would mean there are 9 layers, each adding another 1+3*(...). So, the initial E1 is 1+3, then E2 is 1+3*E1, and so on until E9.\n\nBut when I computed E9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if I have 9 layers. Let me count the number of 1+3( in the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, E1 is 1+3, E2 is 1+3*E1, up to E9. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but when I initially thought of E1 to E9, I had 9 layers, but when I counted the number of 1+3( in the expression, it's 9 layers. So, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each E step again.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing it another way, perhaps using a formula instead of step by step, to see if I get the same result.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is E_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nGiven E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: E_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply initial condition E1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, since E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nThat's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula, and it gives the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation, we compute each layer step by step. \n\nUsing the recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, we find that the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, layer 1 is (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2), and so on. So, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let me define each layer as follows: Layer 1: (1 + 3) Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) ... up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute Layer 9 and then multiply it by 3. Let me compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: Layer 5 = 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: Layer 6 = 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: Layer 7 = 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: Layer 8 = 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's see: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Wait, but that seems a bit off because 3*29524 is actually 88572, right? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, each layer checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I let the entire expression be S, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nBut wait, the inner part is similar to S/3, because S = 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the inner part is (S/3 - 1)/3? Hmm, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression.\n\nBut since we've already got the closed-form solution, maybe that's the most straightforward way.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead to the same conclusion. So, I think the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Start from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 =4.\n\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n3. Compute each layer up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524.\n\n4. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 for the ninth layer, then multiplying by 3.\n\nEither way, the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms each step. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the ninth layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let me define each innermost expression as a variable to make it easier. Let me denote:\n\nLet me think... Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, I can compute each step. So, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, the next layer is 3 times that plus 1, and so on. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is just (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer becomes 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first, which is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, this seems like a pattern is emerging. Let me see if I can find a pattern or if it's just a coincidence.\n\nSo, let's list out the results as we go out each layer:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. Each time we have 3(1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Wait, maybe I should count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside, and then the outermost 3 times that. So, the innermost is layer 1, and then each subsequent layer adds another, up to layer 9, and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, let's make sure I didn't skip any steps.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing the innermost 9 layers, we have 29524, and then we multiply that by 3. So, let's compute 3*29524.\n\n3 * 29524: Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. I didn't make any calculation errors in the intermediate steps. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me just think about whether there's a formulaic way to approach this instead of computing each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented by a geometric series or some recurrence relation, which might save time if the expression were longer. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, let me see:\n\nFrom Layer 1 to Layer 2: 4 * 3 + 1 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFrom Layer 2 to Layer 3: 13 * 3 + 1 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFrom Layer 3 to Layer 4: 40 * 3 + 1 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's a pattern. So, each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me recall how to solve such recursions.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is given by:\n\na_n = k^n * (a_0 + c/(k - 1)) - c/(k - 1)\n\nWait, but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the nth term is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers inside, so n=9. So, the innermost expression after 9 layers is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression after 9 layers is 29524, and then we multiply by 3 as per the outermost operation: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms our earlier step-by-step computation using a formula.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to write the entire expression, it would be 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\n3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, another way to compute it is to recognize that the entire expression simplifies to (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nBut regardless of the method, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, correct. So, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThen, (177147 - 3) = 177144.\n\nDivide by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572. Perfect, that's consistent.\n\nSo, whether I compute step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and I've cross-verified using different methods. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Next Layer**:  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Outermost Layer**:  \n    Multiply the result by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting from E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use here instead of computing each step manually, just to verify.\n\nLooking at the structure, each Ei = 1 + 3*E(i-1). This is a recursive relation. It's a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general form is Ei = a*E(i-1) + b, where a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is Ei = a^i * E0 + (b/(a - 1))*(a^i - 1), where E0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, in this case, E1 is the first term, which is 4. So, maybe E0 isn't defined here. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the homogeneous solution is Ei^h = C*3^i, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution Ei^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Ei = C*3^i - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, Ei = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Ei = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with E1:\n\nE1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the formula holds for each Ei. That's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, because 3*E9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nBut 3^{11} is 177147, so:\n\n(177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The step-by-step computation and the use of the recurrence relation both led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( E_i \\) where \\( E_i = 1 + 3E_{i-1} \\) starting from \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   E_1 &= 1 + 3 = 4, \\\\\n   E_2 &= 1 + 3E_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13, \\\\\n   E_3 &= 1 + 3E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40, \\\\\n   E_4 &= 1 + 3E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121, \\\\\n   E_5 &= 1 + 3E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364, \\\\\n   E_6 &= 1 + 3E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093, \\\\\n   E_7 &= 1 + 3E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280, \\\\\n   E_8 &= 1 + 3E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841, \\\\\n   E_9 &= 1 + 3E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n2. The entire expression is \\( 3E_9 \\):\n   \\[\n   3E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, the entire expression is 3 times Level 9. Let me write this down step by step. Starting with Level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Level 2 would be 1 + 3*(Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Level 2 is 13. Now, Level 3 is 1 + 3*(Level 2). Level 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, Level 3 is 40. Moving on to Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3). Level 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Level 4 is 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Level 5 is 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Level 6 is 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Level 7 is 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Level 8 is 9841. Finally, Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8). 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, Level 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Level 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that again because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 29524 * 3 by adding 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them step by step. 29524 + 29524: 24 + 24 is 48, 52 + 52 is 104, 9000 + 9000 is 18000, and 20000 + 20000 is 40000. Wait, that's not the right way. Maybe it's better to compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.

    "text": " Let me define each nested expression as a separate variable to make it easier. Let me denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, E3, and so on, up to E9. So, E1 = 1 + 3. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1. E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, until E9 = 1 + 3*E8. Then the entire expression is 3*E9. Wait, no, actually, looking back at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, maybe the innermost expression is E1 = 1 + 3, then E2 = 1 + 3*E1, E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, until E9 = 1 + 3*E8. Then the entire expression is 3*E9. Hmm, that might not be accurate because the original expression has nine layers inside the first 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside: Each \"1 + 3(\" starts a new layer. So starting from the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses after that, meaning 9 layers. So, yes, we have 9 layers of nesting. Therefore, the innermost expression is E1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*E_previous. So, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each E step by step. E1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. E2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. E3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. E4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. E5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. E6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. E7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. E8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. E9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*E9 = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, the next term is 1 + 3(...). Each time, inside another set of parentheses, so each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: The first layer after 3 is 1 + 3(...), which is E1. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...), which is E2, and so on until the innermost is E9. So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, my calculation of E1 through E9 should be correct, leading to the final result of 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which is a recursive relation. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it more formally. The general form of such a recurrence is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, which in this case, a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is E_n = a^n * E_0 + (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) * b, where E_0 is the initial term. Wait, let me check that formula. For a linear recurrence of the form E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, the solution is E_n = a^n * E_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). But in our case, E_1 = 1 + 3*E_0, where E_0 would be 1, I think. Wait, no, in our case, E1 = 1 + 3, so E0 might not be defined that way. Let me think again. Let me define E_1 = 1 + 3*E_0, where E_0 is 1. Wait, no, because E1 is 1 + 3, so E0 would be 1, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the recurrence starting from E1. Let me try to model it properly. Let's say E1 = 1 + 3. E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. So, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4. So, in general, E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4. So, to find E9, which is the ninth term, we can use the recurrence relation. The solution to this recurrence is E_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me try to derive it. The recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms: E1 = 4. E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. E9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Now, let's see if there's a pattern or formula for E_n. Let's write down the values:\n\nn | E_n\n1 | 4\n2 | 13\n3 | 40\n4 | 121\n5 | 364\n6 | 1093\n7 | 3280\n8 | 9841\n9 | 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I can try to see if they fit a geometric progression or some other pattern. Let's see:\n\nE1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1? 3 + 1 = 4. Yes.\n\nE2 = 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.\n\nE3 = 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40.\n\nE4 = 121 = 3^4 + 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 81 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 121.\n\nWait, that seems to fit. So, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula for E_n is E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm using the formula. Since E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3^{10} is 59049, so E9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the pattern, I could have just computed each E step by step, as I did earlier, and arrived at the same result.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time, we're adding another layer of 1 + 3*(previous total). So, each layer is contributing a power of 3 multiplied by 1, but because of the nesting, it's a geometric series where each term is 3^k, and the sum is (3^{n} -1)/2, as we've found.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying the pattern, the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step. Recognizing the pattern, we find that each layer follows the formula E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you compute step by step, you might make an error. Let me go back through each E step.\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. So E6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. E7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. E8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then E9 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*29,524.

Let me count again.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3 is E1, then each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So from E1 to E9, that's nine layers. So, my calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each step, but since it's only nine layers, the step-by-step approach is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say E_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = E_n^h + E_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, E1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's test this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each step. Therefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern that fits a recurrence relation, we can find a formula to compute the result efficiently. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Define each nested expression E_n where E1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}.\n3. Compute each E from E1 to E9:\n   - E1 = 4\n   - E2 = 13\n   - E3 = 40\n   - E4 = 121\n   - E5 = 364\n   - E6 = 1093\n   - E7 = 3280\n   - E8 = 9841\n   - E9 = 29524\n4. Multiply E9 by 3 to get the final result: 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me start from the innermost part and work my way out. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3(...). Let me see how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each time I see a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count: starting from the first 1, then each 1 + 3(...) adds another layer. So, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... ))), with nine layers. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's start from the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of the innermost). Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of the previous layer), and so on, until I reach the outermost layer. Then, the entire expression is 3 times the result of the outermost layer. So, let me define this step by step.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nLet\u2019s define E_n as the expression at the nth layer. So, E_1 is the innermost expression: E_1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2\n\nAnd so on, up to E_9, and then the entire expression is 3*E_9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the entire expression is 3*E_9, where E_9 is the 9th layer. But actually, in the original problem, the first term is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost expression is 3 times E_9, where E_9 is the 9th layer. So, let me compute each E_n step by step.\n\nStarting with E_1:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E_9, so:\n\nTotal = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+\" terms after the initial 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nWait, actually, each time you add another layer, you're adding another \"1+3\". So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3\" appears, excluding the initial one. Let me see: the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3\" inside each parenthesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of closing parentheses. Each time we have a closing parenthesis, it's the end of a layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses after the first 3. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another closing parenthesis.\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3) is the first closing parenthesis.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another closing parenthesis. So, the number of closing parentheses is 9. Therefore, there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed up to E_9, which would be the 9th layer, and then multiplied by 3. So, that seems correct. But let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with E_1:\n\nE_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check E_8 again. E_7 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That seems correct.\n\nE_9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check using another method. Alternatively, I can compute the entire expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, so that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E_n.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me substitute into the recurrence:\n\nE_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}\n\nAssume E_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, E_{n} = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, equate:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition E_1 = 4.\n\nE_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nE_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for E_1, n=1:\n\nE_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, E_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, E_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, E_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't make any mistakes:\n\n1. Recognized the nested structure and decided to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Defined E_n as the expression at each layer, starting with E_1=1+3=4.\n\n3. Computed each subsequent E_n up to E_9, each time using the formula E_n=1+3*E_{n-1}.\n\n4. Alternatively, recognized the recurrence relation and solved it to find a closed-form formula E_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\n5. Applied the formula for n=9 to find E_9=29524.\n\n6. Multiplied by 3 to get the final result: 88572.\n\n7. Verified each step and the calculations, ensuring that each multiplication and addition was correct.\n\nI don't see any errors in the reasoning or calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step. The expression is:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWe define each layer as $E_n$, where $E_n = 1 + 3 \\times E_{n-1}$, starting with $E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4$. We compute each layer up to $E_9$ and then multiply by 3.\n\n1. **$E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4$**\n2. **$E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$**\n3. **$E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$**\n4. **$E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$**\n5. **$E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$**\n6. **$E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$**\n7. **$E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$**\n8. **$E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$**\n9. **$E_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$**\n\nFinally, the entire expression is:\n\n$3 \\times E_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me denote each inner expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost one. So, E1 = 1 + 3. Then, E2 = 1 + 3(E1). E3 = 1 + 3(E2), and so on, until E9. Then, the entire expression is 3(E9). So, let me compute each E step by step. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, E1 = 4. Now, moving out one layer, E2 = 1 + 3(E1). Since E1 is 4, E2 = 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, E2 = 13. Next, E3 = 1 + 3(E2). E2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, E3 = 40. Moving on to E4 = 1 + 3(E3). E3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. So, E4 = 121. Now, E5 = 1 + 3(E4). E4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives us 364. So, E5 = 364. Continuing, E6 = 1 + 3(E5). E5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let's compute that. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, E6 = 1093. Next, E7 = 1 + 3(E6). E6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me calculate that: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, E7 = 3280. Moving on to E8 = 1 + 3(E7). E7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them: 9000+600=9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, E8 = 9841. Finally, E9 = 1 + 3(E8). E8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let's calculate that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, E9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3(E9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000+27000=87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from E1 to E9, each step seems correct. E1=4, E2=13, E3=40, E4=121, E5=364, E6=1093, E7=3280, E8=9841, E9=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each step manually, but since the expression is finite and only nine layers deep, computing each step was manageable. I don't recall a specific formula for this kind of nested expression, but maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1). So, it's a recursive relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for E(n). The recurrence relation is E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is E(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence relation: E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1). Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B). Let's simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition E(1) = 4. E(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, E(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with E1: E(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. E(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. E(3) = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems valid. Therefore, E(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, E9 would be (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as I got earlier. So, E9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute E9 using the formula: E9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3(...).

    "text": " Let me number the innermost expression as layer 1, then the next one as layer 2, and so on, up to layer 9. So, layer 1: 1 + 3. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer 2). And so on, until layer 9. Wait, actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by something, which is (1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps I should consider each layer as the expression inside each set of parentheses, starting from the innermost. Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, starting with L1: L1 = 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 is 4. So, L1 = 4. Now, moving out one layer, L2 is 1 + 3*(L1). Since L1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, L2 = 13. Next, L3 is 1 + 3*(L2). L2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, L3 = 40. Moving on to L4: 1 + 3*(L3). L3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. So, L4 = 121. Now, L5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, L5 = 364. Next, L6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, L6 = 1093. Now, L7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, L7 = 3280. Next, L8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, L8 = 9841. Finally, L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding these up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, L9 = 29524. Now, the original expression is 3*(L9). So, that's 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, let me break it down more carefully: 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from L1 to L9, each step seems correct. Each time, I multiplied the previous layer's result by 3 and added 1. Then, finally, I multiplied the last layer's result by 3 to get the final answer. Hmm, let me verify L9 again. L9 = 1 + 3*L8. L8 was 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3 again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. That's correct. Then, 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did that right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. So, if I let x = 1 + 3x, but that might not apply directly here because each layer is a bit different. Wait, actually, each layer is similar, so perhaps it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence where each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as I computed earlier. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is correct. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Now, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. This confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, using the formula, I could have directly computed a_9 and then multiplied by 3 to get the answer. This might be faster for larger numbers of layers, but for nine layers, both methods are manageable. Let me just recap what I did: I first approached the problem by computing each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Then, I recognized the pattern as a recurrence relation and derived a closed-form formula to compute the nth layer directly. This not only confirmed my initial step-by-step answer but also provided a more efficient method for similar problems with more layers. It's interesting how recognizing patterns and applying mathematical concepts like recurrence relations can simplify what initially seems like a tedious computation. I think this problem was a good exercise in both careful step-by-step computation and in identifying mathematical structures that can be analyzed with more advanced techniques. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer or using the derived formula, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times another layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and then multiply the outermost result by 3. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula to compute the nth layer directly, which confirms our step-by-step result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " Let me define each nested expression as a separate term. Let me denote the innermost part as A, then work my way outwards. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first: A = 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*A. Since A is 4, that would be B = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so B = 1 + 12 = 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*B. B is 13, so C = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so C = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here, but let me keep going to see if it becomes clearer. Next layer: D = 1 + 3*C. C is 40, so D = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, that's a big jump. Let me check my calculations so far: A = 1 + 3 = 4. B = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. C = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. D = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. That seems correct. Let me continue. Next layer: E = 1 + 3*D = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so E = 1 + 363 = 364. Wow, that's growing really fast. Next layer: F = 1 + 3*E = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3. Let's do 300*3 = 900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So F = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Wow, this is getting huge. Next layer: G = 1 + 3*F = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So G = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Moving on to the next layer: H = 1 + 3*G = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Therefore, H = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Next layer: I = 1 + 3*H = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So I = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the next layer is the outermost one: the entire expression is 3*(I). Since I is 29524, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait a minute, that seems really large. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me go back and verify each step because sometimes when numbers get large, it's easy to make an error. Starting from the innermost: A = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. B = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. C = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. D = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. E = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. F = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. G = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. H = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. I = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. It looks like each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me denote each term as a_n, where n is the layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers. Wait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count: 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), etc. So, each layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is nine, because the original problem has nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's one layer. Each time we go outward, we add another layer. So, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3). Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1). Layer3: 1 + 3*(layer2). Up to layer9: 1 + 3*(layer8). Then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, yes, nine layers. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation where a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n from 2 to 9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Substituting the general solution: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. So, we have C*3^{n} + D = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, I could have computed it directly without going through each layer, which would have been more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, step-by-step wasn't too bad, though it was time-consuming and required careful calculation to avoid errors. I think I did it correctly, as both methods gave me the same result. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's see:\n\nFrom the expression, I can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1+3 followed by another (.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then moving outward, each layer is 1+3*(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we can go from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 8 layers because after the initial 3, there are 8 more (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is one.\n- Then, each subsequent ( inside adds another.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, we have:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so inside that first (1+3(...)), there are 8 more (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the expression being 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers of 1 + 3*.\n\nWait, because each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), and the number of such layers is 9.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is the first layer.\n- Then, inside that, another (, which is the second layer.\n- Continuing until the innermost part.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, and there are 9 of them.\n\nBut when I computed V1 to V9, I ended up with V9 being 29524, and then 3*V9 = 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), which is V1.\n2. Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 1 + 3*Vn.\n\nWait, so in my earlier computation, I had V1 = 4, V2 = 13, up to V9 = 29524.\n\nBut if the expression only has 8 layers after the initial 3, then perhaps I went one step too far.\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then: (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, so each time, we add another layer. Let me see how many times this happens.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- The first ( after 3 is the start of the first (1+3(...))\n- Then, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's 8 layers because the first (1+3 is the first layer, and then each subsequent ( adds another.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2.

The first ( after 3 is one.\n2. Then, inside that, another (, so two.\n3. Continuing, each ( adds another.\n\nWait, but I can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: because each \"1+3(\" adds one, and the last one is \"1+3)\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 such instances.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to V9, I ended up with 88572, which seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't go one step too far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 8, and I should stop at V8, which is 9841, and then 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, that would make sense too.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers.\n\nLet me write the expression as:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's the first layer.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer adds another 1 + 3*.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3* inside the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3*, there are 9 instances of (1 + 3*...).\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3*\" appears.\n\nWait, each \"1 + 3*\" is followed by another expression, so each one adds a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8 because after the initial 3*(1 + 3*...), there are 8 more layers.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider that each time I have a term like 1 + 3*(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nLet me count the number of such layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer 1) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer 2) \u2192 Layer 3\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9, which would mean 9 layers. Wait, but when I computed up to V9, I got 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 8 because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 8 layers inside the initial 3*.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the expression being 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, until Layer 9 is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, in that case, there are 9 layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nTherefore, my initial computation where I went up to V9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, would be correct.\n\nBut to make sure, let me try to compute the expression with a smaller number of layers to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let's compute that manually.\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, the outermost: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, using my method:\n\nV1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nV2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*V2 = 39.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), that would be three layers.\n\nCompute innermost: V1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nV2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nV3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, entire expression: 3*40 = 120.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, in the original problem, with nine layers, my computation up to V9 = 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572, should be correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it again step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. V1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. V2 = 1 + 3*V1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. V3 = 1 + 3*V2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. V4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. V5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. V6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. V7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. V8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. V9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*V9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it as 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each step, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

    "text": " Let me define each nested expression as a term. Let me call the innermost part as E1, then moving outward, E2, E3, up to E9, and then the outermost 3 times that. So, E1 = 1 + 3. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1. E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9, and then the final result is 3*E9. That seems manageable. So, let's compute each E step by step. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3. That's simple, right? 1 + 3 is 4. So, E1 = 4. Now, moving outward to E2: E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, E2 = 13. Next, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, E3 = 40. Now, E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Therefore, E4 = 121. Moving on to E5: E5 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Thus, E5 = 364. Next, E6 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. So, E6 = 1093. Now, E7 = 1 + 3*E6. E6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me calculate that: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, E7 = 3280. Next, E8 = 1 + 3*E7. E7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Hmm, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Therefore, E8 = 9841. Now, E9 = 1 + 3*E8. E8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let me compute that step by step. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, E9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from E1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. E2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. E3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. E4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. E5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. E6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. E7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. E8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. E9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each step manually, but since the nesting isn't too deep (only nine layers), step-by-step computation is manageable. It looks like each En is following a pattern where En = 1 + 3*E(n-1), starting from E1 = 4. This kind of recursive relation can sometimes be expressed using a geometric series or a formula, but for just nine terms, computing each step is straightforward. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe recognizing a geometric progression or something similar. Each En is 1 + 3*E(n-1), which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is En = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works here. Given En = 1 + 3*E(n-1), the homogeneous solution is En^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume En^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is En = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition E1 = 4. When n=1, En = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, En = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, En = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each n, En is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: E2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: E3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: E4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, En = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have E9, which is the ninth term, we can compute E9 using this formula. Plugging n=9: E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each step manually or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct. I think I've thoroughly checked the problem and the solution. There doesn't seem to be any mistake in the calculations, and the formula approach corroborates the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is defined recursively. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each term follows the pattern En = 1 + 3*E(n-1). Using this recursive relation, we compute each term up to E9, which results in 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, E1 = 1 + 3 (but wait, actually, looking again, each expression is 1 + 3 times another expression. So, the innermost one is 1 + 3, but then the next one is 1 + 3 times (1 + 3), and so on. Wait, actually, let me correct that. The innermost expression is just 1 + 3, right? Because the innermost parentheses are (1 + 3). Then, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(E1), where E1 is 1 + 3. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(E2), where E2 is 1 + 3*(E1), and so on. So, in general, each En = 1 + 3*E(n-1), starting from E1 = 1 + 3. Let me confirm that. So, E1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then E2 is 1 + 3*(E1), E3 is 1 + 3*(E2), and so on up to E9. But wait, in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(E9). So, the total expression is 3*(E9). So, maybe I can compute E1 through E9 step by step. Let me write that out. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, that's not the right way. Actually, 29524 is 29,524. So, 3*29,524. Let's compute it step by step: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000, 9,000*3=27,000, 500*3=1,500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each En again to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. E1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. E2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. E3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. E4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. E5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. E6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. E7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. So, E7 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. E8: 1 + 3*3,280. Let's compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9,000 + 600 = 9,600 + 240 = 9,840. So, E8 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. E9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 3*9,841: 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then E9 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems right. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 29,524 * 3 again. Let's do it digit by digit: 29,524 \u00d7 3.\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the expression had nine layers, but when I counted the parentheses, I saw nine opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me double-check how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the outermost, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. The innermost is (1+3), then each layer out adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let me see: The innermost is (1+3). Then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There's one after the first 3, then each subsequent layer adds another. So, the structure is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of times 1+3 is enclosed by parentheses. Each time we have a new (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost: (1+3), then (1+3(...)), and so on. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: There are nine closing parentheses after the initial 3, so that would mean nine layers. So, E1 to E9 as I did before. So, nine layers, each En = 1 + 3*E(n-1). So, my calculation of E1 through E9 should be correct, leading to E9=29,524, and then 3*E9=88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute E9 again. E1=4, E2=13, E3=40, E4=121, E5=364, E6=1,093, E7=3,280, E8=9,841, E9=29,524. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, since each layer is a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. The recurrence is En = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is En = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. The homogeneous solution is En^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution En^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is En = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition E1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is En = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, En = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: E1 = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, E9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, E9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*E9 = 3*29,524=88,572. So, that confirms my earlier result using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Yes, correct. So, E9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Correct. So, 3*29,524=88,572. That's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). If I expand it, each layer adds another term. Let me try expanding it step by step to see if it forms a geometric series.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as S. So, S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But wait, the inner expression is similar to S itself, but scaled. Wait, actually, no. Let me think: If I let E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )), then E = 1 + 3*E. But in our case, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(... )). So, perhaps I can model it as S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), where the inner expression is similar to E, but with one fewer layer. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding it.\n\nLet me consider the innermost expression first: E1 = 1 + 3. Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, etc. Alternatively, each En can be written as 1 + 3*E(n-1). So, as I did before, the closed-form is En = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for n=9, E9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29,524. Then, S = 3*E9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see the expansion as a sum: Each time you expand a layer, you're adding another term that's 3^k. Let me try to see if the expression can be written as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nLet me write out the expression step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nSo, each En is 1 + 3*E(n-1). So, the closed-form formula is En = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, as I found earlier.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3*E9 = 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways, both iteratively and using the closed-form formula, and both give the same result. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by recognizing the repeating pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is defined as \\( E_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_{n-1} \\) with the innermost layer \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( E_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot E_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The outermost expression is \\( 3 \\cdot E_9 \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me number them from the innermost to the outermost. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then the next layer out is 3 times that plus 1, and so on. Maybe if I compute each layer step by step, it'll be manageable. Let me write this down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let me define each step as a variable to keep track. Let me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n- Let\u2019s start with the innermost expression: Let\u2019s call it A1 = 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. Then, moving outwards, each subsequent layer will be 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, A2 = 1 + 3*A1, A3 = 1 + 3*A2, and so on, up to A9, since there are nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*A9. Wait, no, actually, looking back at the problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so it's 3 multiplied by the first layer. So, maybe I should compute each A1 through A9, and then multiply the final A9 by 3. Let me try that approach. So, let me compute each A step by step.\n\nStarting with A1:\nA1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, A2 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*A6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*A7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nA9 = 1 + 3*A8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so A9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*A9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*A1, but no, wait, actually, in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost layer is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*A1, but in our numbering, A1 was the innermost. Hmm, maybe I got confused with the numbering. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the outermost expression as the first step. Let me try a different approach. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(4) + 1 = 13\n3. Next: 3*(13) + 1 = 40\n4. Next: 3*(40) + 1 = 121\n5. Next: 3*(121) + 1 = 364\n6. Next: 3*(364) + 1 = 1093\n7. Next: 3*(1093) + 1 = 3280\n8. Next: 3*(3280) + 1 = 9841\n9. Next: 3*(9841) + 1 = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so maybe there are nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous), and then the outermost is 3 times that. Let me recount the layers in the problem.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Each time we add another layer, so let's see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each step adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does 1 + 3 appear? Let me count the opening parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3). Then moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as the number of 1+3 terms. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1+3), then each time we have another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Each time we go out, another 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many times does 1 + 3 occur? Let me count the number of times \"1+\" appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of \"1+\", each followed by a \"3(...)\". So, that would mean there are 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous). Then, the entire expression is 3*(result of the 9th layer). So, in my earlier calculation, I computed A1 to A9, where A1 was 4, A2 was 13, up to A9 being 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*A9, which would be 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me verify that because when I counted the layers earlier, I thought A9 was 29524, which would make the final answer 3*29524 = 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me go through each step again:\n\nA1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nA2 = 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*A6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*A7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nA9 = 1 + 3*A8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nA1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nA9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I feel like 88572 might be the correct answer, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each step manually. I remember that expressions of the form a + r*(a + r*(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using a formula for geometric series or recursive relations.\n\nIn this case, each layer is defined as A_n = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}, with A_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is A_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is A_n = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}, with A_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: A_n - 3*A_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A_n^p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is A_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, A_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is A_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: A_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, A_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, A_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Good, so that checks out.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that 3^{10} is indeed 59049. Let me compute 3^10 step by step:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, A_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could express the final answer as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms it again.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me recompute the multiplication: 3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nFinally, 2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdd them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to recap, the problem was to compute:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nWe broke it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, verified the calculations, and then used a general formula for the recurrence relation to confirm the result. Both methods led us to the same answer, so I'm pretty sure that 88572 is correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me recount the layers once more to ensure that I didn't miscount the number of times to apply the recurrence.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" terms after the initial 3.\n\nEach time, we have a \"1+3(\" which opens a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...).\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let me count:\n\n- After the initial 3(1+3(...)), each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...).\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which is 9 times. So, we have 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous). Therefore, A1 to A9 as computed earlier, and then 3*A9.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 9 layers, leading to A9=29524, then 3*A9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since n=9, A9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*A9=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. The answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each expression is 1 + 3 times the previous one. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the outermost layer. So, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost, we have to multiply it by 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Let me do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic.\n\nSo, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down digit by digit:\n\n2 (ten thousands place): 2*3=6\n\n9 (thousands place): 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5 (hundreds place): 5*3=15 + 2 (carryover) =17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2 (tens place): 2*3=6 + 1=7, write down 7.\n\n4 (units place): 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the units digit is 4, so 4*3=12, so we write 2 and carryover 1 to the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the previous calculation, I think I may have made a mistake in the order. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4*3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5*3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9*3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2*3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in my previous breakdown, I thought of 29524 as 2 9 5 2 4, but when multiplying by 3, we go from right to left. So, 4*3=12, 2*3=6+1=7, 5*3=15, 9*3=27+1=28, 2*3=6+2=8. So, the digits are 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 layers of (1+3(...)), right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside it's (1+3(...)), then inside that another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of times I see (1+3(...)):\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, but when I started computing, I went up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is the first layer.\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(...)), which is the second layer.\n\nContinuing this way, each time I see a (1+3(...)), that's a new layer.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the outermost layer, and then I multiplied by 3, which was the initial 3 outside. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more by computing each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds upon the previous one, and the arithmetic checks out.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute Layer 9 again:\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a four-digit number, so:\n\n9841\n\n*    3\n\n--------\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 before the 9. Wait, that would make it 29523.\n\nWait, so 9841 *3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to see if there's a quicker way, but since the number of layers is manageable (only 9), computing step by step is feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps recognizing this as a geometric series or something similar could help. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, that's a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recursive relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\nCompute (3^{1+1} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, as we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. It's faster and avoids step-by-step computation, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since it's only 9 layers, both methods work.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the general formula. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThe solution I found was a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test it for n=4: a_4 should be 121.\n\nCompute (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I considered both step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form formula to verify the result. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

    "text": " Let me define each part step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Let me denote each level as follows: Let\u2019s say the innermost expression is Level 1: Level 1: 1 + 3 (but wait, actually, in the given problem, the innermost is 1 + 3, but it's followed by another 1 + 3, so maybe I should consider each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer). Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. So, starting from the innermost parentheses, which is the last (1+3). Let me compute that first. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one level out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(Level 1). So, Level 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. That's Level 3: 40. Next layer out: Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, 121. Then, Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5: 364. Moving on, Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 364*3 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 6: 1093. Next, Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 7: 3280. Then, Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3280*3 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 8: 9841. Finally, the outermost layer, Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's see, 9841*3. I can break this down: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. So, 3*9841=29523. Therefore, Level 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the innermost expression evaluates up to 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, the final step is to compute 3*(29524). Let me calculate that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. So, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because this seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Level n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see, the general form is Level n = a*Level(n-1) + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is Level n = a^n * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but in this case, a=3, so the homogeneous solution is 3^n * C, and the particular solution is a constant since the nonhomogeneous term is constant.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation:\n\nLevel n = 3*Level(n-1) + 1, with Level 1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, in my earlier breakdown, Level 1 was 4, but in the problem, the innermost expression is 1+3, which is Level 1=4. So, the recurrence starts at Level 1=4.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to adjust the indices so that Level 1 is the innermost, which is 4, and then Level 2 is 13, Level 3 is 40, etc., up to Level 9=29524.\n\nSo, the recurrence is Level k = 3*Level(k-1) +1, with Level 1=4.\n\nBut let's solve this recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is Level_h(k) = C*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution, say Level_p(k) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A +1.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A =1\n\n-2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Level(k) = C*3^k -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition Level(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 =3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Level(k)= (3/2)*3^k -1/2 = (3^(k+1))/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Level(k)= (3^(k+1) -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor k=1: (3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, matches Level1=4.\n\nFor k=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, Level2=13.\n\nFor k=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, Level3=40.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, Level(k)= (3^(k+1) -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Level9, which is the outermost expression, we can compute it as:\n\nLevel9= (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Level9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. But let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes in the exponentiation.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nThen, 29524*3=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward, each time computing the value step by step. Using the recurrence relation and a closed-form formula, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524, and multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can think of each inner expression as a function or a value that I can compute step by step. Let me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E9 is the innermost one. So, E9 = 1 + 3. Then, E8 = 1 + 3*E9, E7 = 1 + 3*E8, and so on, until E1, which is the outermost expression, and the entire problem is 3*E1. That seems manageable. So, let's define E9 first. E9 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, E8 = 1 + 3*E9. Since E9 is 4, E8 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Now, E7 = 1 + 3*E8. E8 is 13, so E7 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let's keep going. E6 = 1 + 3*E7. E7 is 40, so E6 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, this is increasing rapidly. E5 = 1 + 3*E6. E6 is 121, so E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E4 = 1 + 3*E5. E5 is 364, so E4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E3 = 1 + 3*E4. E4 is 1093, so E3 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E2 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 3280, so E2 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E1 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 9841, so E1 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*E1, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. I can break this down. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from E9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. E8: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. E7: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. E6: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. E5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. E4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. E3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. E2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. E1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this problem as a geometric series or something similar, but given the nested structure, working from the inside out seems more straightforward. Each step is just multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can generalize this to see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the result without computing each step, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad. Let me see if there's a pattern in the values I got: E9 = 4, E8 = 13, E7 = 40, E6 = 121, E5 = 364, E4 = 1093, E3 = 3280, E2 = 9841, E1 = 29524. Looking at these numbers, each term is roughly three times the previous term plus 1. So, each E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n+1). This is a linear recurrence relation, and I know that the solution to such a recurrence is of the form E(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a general formula. The recurrence is E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n+1), with E(9) = 4. Wait, actually, in my earlier calculation, E9 was the innermost term, which corresponds to n=9, and E1 corresponds to n=1. So, maybe it's better to index it from n=1 to n=9, with E1 being the outermost. Let me redefine it as E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n+1), with E(9) = 4. Then, we can solve for E(n) in terms of E(n+1). Let's write the recurrence relation as E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n+1). To solve this, we can rearrange it as E(n+1) = (E(n) - 1)/3. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is E(n+1) = (E(n))/3, which has the solution E_h(n) = C*(1/3)^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (-1/3), we can assume a constant particular solution E_p(n) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = (K - 1)/3. Multiply both sides by 3: 3K = K - 1. Subtract K: 2K = -1. So, K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is E(n) = C*(1/3)^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. Wait, but our initial condition is E(9) = 4. So, when n=9, E(9) = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*(1/3)^9 - 1/2. Let's solve for C: C*(1/3)^9 = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2) * 3^9. Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, C = (9/2)*19683 = (9*19683)/2. Let's compute 9*19683: 10*19683=196830, subtract 19683: 196830 - 19683 = 177147. So, C = 177147 / 2 = 88573.5. Therefore, the general solution is E(n) = 88573.5*(1/3)^n - 1/2. Now, we need E(1), which is the outermost expression. Let's compute E(1): E(1) = 88573.5*(1/3)^1 - 1/2 = 88573.5*(1/3) - 1/2 = 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, E(1) = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*E(1) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the recurrence relation method also gives the same result. This makes me confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series, but since each term depends on the next, it's a bit different. However, using the recurrence relation approach worked well. So, in summary, by either expanding each nested expression step by step or by solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the inner result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is multiplied by 3. The detailed computation shows that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The homogeneous solution is E_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_p(n) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is E(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: E4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: E5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: E6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: E7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: E8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: E9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula holds. Therefore, E(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since E(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*E(n) = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*E9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified this enough ways. Each step seems consistent, both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations. Both methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation approach, a closed-form solution confirms the result. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Substitute into next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue substituting each layer outward until the outermost expression is reached.\n4. The final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me denote each inner expression as E1, E2, E3, etc., where each E is 1 + 3*(next E). So, starting from the innermost, which is E1: E1 = 1 + 3*(nothing inside) because the innermost expression is just 1 + 3. Wait, no, actually, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, so that's E1 = 1 + 3. Then the next one out would be E2 = 1 + 3*E1, then E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, up to E9, which would be the outermost expression, and then the entire original expression is 3*E9. Hmm, that might help. So, let me define E1 to E9 as follows:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nAnd the original expression is 3*E9.\n\nSo, if I compute E1 first, then E2, and so on, each time plugging the previous E into the next one, I can work my way up to E9, and then multiply by 3 to get the final answer. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with E1:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that was simple enough. Now, moving to E2:\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, E2 is 13. Now, E3:\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE3 is 40. Next, E4:\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE4 is 121. Now, E5:\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE5 is 364. Moving on to E6:\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nE6 is 1,093. Now, E7:\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nE7 is 3,280. Next, E8:\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nE8 is 9,841. Finally, E9:\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nSo, E9 is 29,524. Now, the original expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29,524. Let me compute that:\n\n3*29,524. Let's break it down:\n\n3*20,000 = 60,000\n\n3*9,000 = 27,000\n\n3*500 = 1,500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 29,524 times 3. Let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom to top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing E1 to E9. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nE1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3*E9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the steps check out. So, I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each step, which might be faster or provide a better understanding. Let me think about that.\n\nEach E is defined as E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. This looks like a recurrence relation. Specifically, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe general form of a linear recurrence is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, where a and b are constants. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by E_n = (E_0 - b/(1 - a)) * a^n + b/(1 - a), assuming a \u2260 1.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence of the form E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, the solution is E_n = a^n * E_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), if a \u2260 1.\n\nWait, let me check that. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: E_n^{(h)} = C * a^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution, say E_n^{(p)} = K, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = a*K + b \u21d2 K - a*K = b \u21d2 K*(1 - a) = b \u21d2 K = b/(1 - a).\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = C*a^n + K.\n\nUsing the initial condition, say E_0. Wait, in our case, E1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. Let me adjust the indices.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index the recurrence starting from n=0. Let me see.\n\nWait, in our problem, E1 = 4, E2 = 13, etc. So, E1 corresponds to n=1.\n\nSo, maybe E_n = C*3^n + K.\n\nUsing E1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + K \u21d2 4 = 3C + K.\n\nWe also have the particular solution K = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Wait, because in the particular solution, K = b/(1 - a) where a=3, b=1, so K = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2.\n\nSo, substituting K = -1/2 into 4 = 3C + (-1/2):\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check this formula with n=1: E1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: E4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: E5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: E6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2,187 - 1)/2 = 2,186/2 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: E7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6,561 - 1)/2 = 6,560/2 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: E8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19,683 - 1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince our problem has E9, which is when n=9, so E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524, as we calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives us the same result as computing each step manually. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each E_n is one more than three times the previous E, leading to a geometric progression, but since each step depends on the previous, the formula approach is more efficient.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and recognizing the pattern, I was able to compute each layer step by step and then apply the final multiplication by 3 to get the result. Additionally, by solving the recurrence relation, I confirmed that the result is consistent, which adds confidence in the answer's correctness.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each value step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows us to derive a formula, confirming the result. The final computation gives the answer as 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4.\n2. **Compute each layer sequentially**:\n   - E1 = 4\n   - E2 = 13\n   - E3 = 40\n   - E4 = 121\n   - E5 = 364\n   - E6 = 1,093\n   - E7 = 3,280\n   - E8 = 9,841\n   - E9 = 29,524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me define the innermost expression as a base case and then build outward. Let's say the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Because that's the first one without any more parentheses. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3*4 = 12, and then 1 + 12 = 13. So, the second innermost expression is 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that. 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, the third layer is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me write down the results so far to see if I can spot a pattern or maybe find a formula. Innermost layer (layer 1): 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times this result, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, after computing layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Sometimes when I do multiple layers, it's easy to slip up. Let me recheck each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That's correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Yep, that's right. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Yes, that's accurate. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Right. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. The general form is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The standard form is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4, we can find C. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, we have 9 layers, right? Let me check that. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1, and going out to layer 9. So, n=9. Therefore, the value would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Wait, that's exactly what I got for layer 9 earlier. So, that checks out. Therefore, the innermost 9 layers give 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572, which is 3*(29,524). Alternatively, if I use the formula for the entire expression, which is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). Let's compute that: 3*(59,048/2) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and use it in the next. The final result is obtained by multiplying the innermost value by 3, leading to the answer 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That's straightforward. Then, E2 = 1 + 3(E1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that's E2. Then E3 = 1 + 3(E2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let's keep going.

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check E7 again because 3*1093 is 3279, right? 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Correct. Then E7=1+3279=3280. Correct. E8=1+3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then E8=1+9840=9841. Correct. E9=1+3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute that again. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 +3=29,523. Then E9=1 +29,523=29,524. Correct. Then 3*29,524: Let me compute 29,524*3 again. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify each step once more. E1: 1+3=4. Correct. E2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. E3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. E4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. E5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. E6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. E7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. E8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. E9:1+3*9841=1+29,523=29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. Correct. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, I think I've computed it correctly. But wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E_n. Let me think about it. The recurrence is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)}=A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)}=C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is E_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition E1=4: E1= A*3^1 -1/2=3A -1/2=4. So, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is E_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, E_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: E1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: E2= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, E_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have nine layers, E9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, E9= (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29,524=88,572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula also leads me to the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding one, but in this case, since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's a bit different. But the formula approach definitely confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) another similar expression. By breaking down each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each term step by step. \n\n1. **Innermost Layer (E1):**  \n   \\( E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n2. **Next Layer (E2):**  \n   \\( E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times E_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n\n3. **Next Layer (E3):**  \n   \\( E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times E_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n\n4. **Next Layer (E4):**  \n   \\( E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times E_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n\n5. **Next Layer (E5):**  \n   \\( E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times E_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n\n6. **Next Layer (E6):**  \n   \\( E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times E_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n\n7. **Next Layer (E7):**  \n   \\( E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times E_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n\n8. **Next Layer (E8):**  \n   \\( E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times E_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n\n9. **Outermost Layer (E9):**  \n   \\( E_9 = 1 + 3 \\times E_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times E_9\\):  \n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me number the innermost parentheses as Layer 1, then the next one as Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) ... and so on until Layer 9. So, I can compute each layer step by step, using the result from the previous layer. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 equals 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 equals 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let's compute that: 364*3. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute that: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let's calculate that: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let's compute this carefully. 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400, plus 120 is 29,520, plus 3 is 29,523. So, 3*9841 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Layer 9 = 29,524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, we need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these together:\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29,524 * 3 should be 88,572? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Hmm, that's correct. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29,524. Let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the previous steps.\n\nLet me go back through the layers step by step to ensure each computation is correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, multiplying 29,524 by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) and so on, with nine sets of parentheses. So, when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then we multiply by 3. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard approach to solving such equations is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3*A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, a_9 is indeed 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, whether computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation formula, the result is 88,572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this. Each step makes sense, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. The final result is computed by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Innermost of the outer expression):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n10. **Final Computation:**  \n    Multiply the result by 3:  \n    \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the computed value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, starting from the inside:\n\nInnermost: A = 1 + 3\n\nThen moving outward: B = 1 + 3A\n\nNext: C = 1 + 3B\n\nAnd so on, until I reach the outermost expression. Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I might need to compute nine terms, each depending on the previous one. Let me write this out step by step.\n\nFirst, compute A = 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, A = 4.\n\nNext, compute B = 1 + 3A. Since A is 4, that's 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. So, B = 13.\n\nThen, compute C = 1 + 3B. B is 13, so 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. So, C = 40.\n\nContinuing this way, compute D = 1 + 3C. C is 40, so 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. D = 121.\n\nNext, E = 1 + 3D. D is 121, so 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E = 364.\n\nThen, F = 1 + 3E. E is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, F = 1093.\n\nNext, G = 1 + 3F. F is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093: 1093*3. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Therefore, G = 3280.\n\nContinuing, H = 1 + 3G. G is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, H = 9841.\n\nNext, I = 1 + 3H. H is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, I = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? So, starting from the innermost, we have A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I. So, that's nine layers, each building on the previous. So, after computing I, which is the ninth layer, we then have the outermost expression, which is 3 times I. Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire inner expression. So, after computing the innermost, we go up each layer, and after nine layers, we have the term inside the outermost parentheses, which is 1 + 3*(...). But actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, if I computed up to I, that would be the innermost part, and then each layer outwards is 1 + 3*(previous result). But perhaps I've gone too far. Let me recount the number of layers.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), so each time there's another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections.\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The first inner part is (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another (1 + 3(...))\n4. Continuing, up to the innermost which is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does (1 + 3) appear? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, that's 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to I = 29524, which is Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, yes, after computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, maybe I made a miscalculation in the layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the number of times we have (1 + 3(...) is 9, starting from the innermost (1 + 3). So, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, as I computed earlier, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, up to Layer 9 being 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, which is correct. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, in my earlier computation, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount how many layers you've computed.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first one is (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent one is another (1 + 3(...)). So, let me count the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)):\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then, inside that, (1 + 3*(...))\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, let's see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3*, there are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. So, that would mean 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But I'm concerned that perhaps I miscounted the layers because sometimes the number of layers can be off by one.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me write down each layer with their corresponding computations to ensure I haven't missed any.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer builds on the previous one, and after nine layers, we reach 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by computing a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say we have a simpler version with fewer layers, like 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute that manually and see if my method works.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nFirst, compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, outermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, let's compute it step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, the outermost: 3*(40) = 120\n\nAlternatively, compute the entire expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nWhich is correct. So, using the same method, the result is 120.\n\nSimilarly, if I compute it with my method for the smaller case, it works. So, that gives me confidence that my approach is correct for the larger problem.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just cross-verify this with another method, perhaps using a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me see if I can model this problem as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*(3)^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nTo solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I computed earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThus, using the recurrence relation method, I also arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is scaled by 3 and an additional constant is added.\n\nBut in this case, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward and confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. After computing nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final value.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinal step: Multiply by 3  \n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then A8 = 1 + 3*A9, A7 = 1 + 3*A8, and so on until A1 = 1 + 3*A2. Then the entire expression is 3*A1. Wait, actually, looking back at the problem, the outermost expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), which would correspond to A1 as I just defined. So, perhaps it's better to compute each An starting from A9 and moving outward. Let me try that. Let's compute A9 first. A9 = 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. So, A9 = 4. Now, moving outward to A8: A8 = 1 + 3*A9. Since A9 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, A8 = 13. Next, A7 = 1 + 3*A8. Since A8 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, A7 = 40. Moving on to A6: A6 = 1 + 3*A7. A7 is 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. A6 = 121. Next, A5 = 1 + 3*A6. A6 is 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. A5 = 364. Then, A4 = 1 + 3*A5. A5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. A4 = 1,093. Moving outward to A3: A3 = 1 + 3*A4. A4 is 1,093, so 3*1,093 is 3,279, plus 1 is 3,280. A3 = 3,280. Next, A2 = 1 + 3*A3. A3 is 3,280, so 3*3,280 is 9,840, plus 1 is 9,841. A2 = 9,841. Then, A1 = 1 + 3*A2. A2 is 9,841, so 3*9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. A1 = 29,524. Finally, the entire expression is 3*A1, which is 3*29,524. Let me compute that: 3*29,524. Breaking it down, 3*20,000 is 60,000; 3*9,000 is 27,000; 3*500 is 1,500; 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; plus 1,500 is 88,500; plus 72 is 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.

So, let me compute each E step by step. Starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, E2 is 1 + 3 times E1, so E2 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, E2 = 13. Next, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. Since E2 is 13, 3*13 = 39, and then 1 + 39 = 40. So, E3 = 40. Moving on to E4: E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. E4 = 121. Now, E5 = 1 + 3*E4.

Starting from the innermost, each time we have a new 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...): 1. 1+3 2. 1+3(1+3) 3. 1+3(1+3(1+3)) 4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) 5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) 6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) 7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) 8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) 9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) So, actually, there are nine layers here. That means starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, if I can compute each a\u2081 through a\u2089, then the entire expression is 3 times a\u2089. Let me write that down:\n\n- a\u2081 = 1 + 3\n- a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081\n- a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082\n- a\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083\n- a\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084\n- a\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085\n- a\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086\n- a\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087\n- a\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * a\u2089. So, I can compute each a step by step.\n\nStarting with a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, a\u2089 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times a\u2089, so 3 * 29524. Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Let me think. Each a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a\u2099 - 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a\u2099 + c\u2081a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + ... = f(n). In this case, it's a\u2099 = 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + 1.\n\nSo, the homogeneous solution is the solution to a\u2099 = 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, which is a constant multiple of 3\u207f. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a\u2099 = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a\u2081 = 4 = A*3\u00b9 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3\u00b9\u2070: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by defining a sequence where each term is built from the previous one.

Let me think: Let\u2019s denote the innermost expression as E1, then the next one as E2, and so on, up to E9, which is the outermost expression.

Let me compute each E step by step.\n\nStarting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nGot it. Now, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yep, that's correct.\n\nMoving on to E4: E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems right.\n\nNext, E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHold on, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That seems correct.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Okay.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLet me check that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841: let me compute that again to make sure. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, E9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, so that would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that multiplication another way to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation.\n\nStarting from E1 to E9:\n\nE1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2:1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3:1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4:1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5:1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6:1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7:1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8:1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9:1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each step manually, which could be error-prone. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the expression, each E is defined as E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1=4.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation. The general form is E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, which is a linear recurrence. In this case, a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation can be found using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. The formula is E_n = (E_1 - b/(a-1)) * a^{n-1} + b/(a-1).\n\nWait, let me verify that. For a recurrence relation E_n = a*E_{n-1} + b, the solution is E_n = a^{n-1}*(E_1) + b*(a^{n-1} - 1)/(a - 1).\n\nWait, let me think again. The homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*a^{n}, and the particular solution can be found as a constant. Let's suppose E_n^p = K. Then, substituting into the recurrence: K = a*K + b => K - a*K = b => K(1 - a) = b => K = b/(1 - a). So, the general solution is E_n = C*a^{n} + K.\n\nApplying the initial condition E_1 = 4: E_1 = C*a^{1} + K = C*a + K = 4.\n\nSo, C = (4 - K)/a.\n\nSince K = b/(1 - a), and here a=3, b=1, so K = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nThus, E_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying E_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is E_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with E1: n=1, E1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nE2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nE3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nE4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nE5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nE6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nE7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nE8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nE9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as we calculated earlier.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can see that E_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, E9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, and the final result is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, whether I compute each step manually or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me try that. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So Layer 1 is 4. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13: that's 39. So 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.

So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. So adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So the total value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. It's easy to slip up with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = 88,572. Let me check 3*29524 again. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's it. Each layer built upon the previous one, and by carefully computing each step, I arrived at the solution without making any errors. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the innermost parentheses first and working outward. Each layer is computed step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me think of each \"1 + 3(...)\" as a term. So, the innermost term is the ninth one: 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the ninth layer is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the eighth layer would be 1 + 3*(ninth layer). Since the ninth layer is 4, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, the eighth layer is 13. Now, the seventh layer would be 1 + 3*(eighth layer). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, the seventh layer is 40. The sixth layer is 1 + 3*(seventh layer). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. The sixth layer is 121. The fifth layer is 1 + 3*(sixth layer). So, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. The fifth layer is 364. The fourth layer is 1 + 3*(fifth layer). So, 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. The fourth layer is 1093. The third layer is 1 + 3*(fourth layer). So, 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. The third layer is 3280. The second layer is 1 + 3*(third layer). So, 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. The second layer is 9841. Finally, the first layer, which is the outermost one, is 1 + 3*(second layer). So, 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841 first. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let me do that step by step: 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400; 29,400 + 120 is 29,520; 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. So, 3*9841 is 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29,524. So, the first layer is 29,524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times that first layer, right? Because the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, I need to compute 3*29,524. Let me calculate that: 29,524*3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3 is 60,000; 9,000*3 is 27,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 20*3 is 60; and 4*3 is 12. Adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500; 88,500 + 60 is 88,560; 88,560 + 12 is 88,572. So, 3*29,524 is 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4, then each subsequent layer was computed correctly by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Each step seems to follow logically, and when I got to the outermost layer, I multiplied by 3 again. It all adds up, so I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the inner result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": " Let me denote each inner expression as E1, E2, E3, etc., from the innermost to the outermost. So, the innermost part is E1 = 1 + 3. Then, moving outward, E2 = 1 + 3*E1, then E3 = 1 + 3*E2, and so on, until E9, which would be the outermost expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9. Hmm, that might make it easier to compute each step. Let me try that. So, starting with E1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving outward, E2 = 1 + 3*E1. Since E1 is 4, then E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Now, E3 = 1 + 3*E2. E2 is 13, so E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me keep going. E4 = 1 + 3*E3. E3 is 40, so E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's a jump. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*E9, so that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572, so adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check that multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. That seems correct. So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Each Ei is 1 + 3*E(i-1). This seems to form a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each step, just for verification. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). There are nine layers here, each adding another 1 + 3*... So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a function of the previous term. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I did earlier. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, to find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation, we can look for a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is our E9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, E9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the result. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. It's always good to verify the result using different methods to be sure. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 1 +3*4=13. Then, 1 +3*13=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121. Then, 1 +3*121=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1093. Then, 1 +3*1093=3280. Then, 1 +3*3280=9841. Then, 1 +3*9841=29524. Finally, 3*29524=88572. Each step seems correct, and the formula also gives the same result. So, I think I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. \n\nWe denote each inner expression as \\(E_i\\) where \\(i\\) ranges from 1 to 9.
