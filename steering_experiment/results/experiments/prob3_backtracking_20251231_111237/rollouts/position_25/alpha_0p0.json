Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, 29524*3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524*2 first: 29524*2 = 59048. Then add 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then 79048 + 9524 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, I arrive at the total value of 88572. I don't think I made any calculation errors because each step built on the previous one, and I double-checked each multiplication. It's a bit time-consuming, but since each layer only depends on the previous one, it's manageable. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer manually. Maybe recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar? Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. This is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added 1 each time. Wait, actually, it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built using the previous one. So, the sequence would be: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n... and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each term step by step. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. First, let's write the homogeneous recurrence: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's check this formula with the first few terms to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer manually or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition.

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572 Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplication part. Let's verify Layer 9 first: Layer 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523, then adding 1 gives 29524. That seems correct. Then 3*29524: Let's compute it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my final answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me recount the layers and ensure I didn't skip any or compute incorrectly. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Each step seems correct: 1 + 3*previous layer.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(a_1), where a_1 = 1 + 3(a_2), and a_2 = 1 + 3(a_3), and so on, until a_9 = 1 + 3(a_10), but wait, actually, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3. Then a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9, which is the innermost expression. Wait, no, actually, the outermost expression is 3 times a_9, where a_9 is 1 + 3(a_8). So, there are nine layers inside the initial 3(...). Hmm, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can compute a_2, a_3, ..., a_9 using this formula. Let me compute them again using the recurrence relation to verify: a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n in the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a general solution for this recurrence. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Let me just recap: the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(...).

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when you carry over, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, yes, 88572 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. It's easy to get lost in so many layers. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is indeed 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, and each time, the numbers are getting larger as expected. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier calculation. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think I've arrived at the correct answer by both iterative computation and using the recurrence relation formula. It's always good to check using a different method to ensure that the answer is consistent.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and identify the recurrence relation.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step starting from the innermost.\n\n3. Alternatively, solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression.\n\n4. Compute the final result by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nBoth methods led to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure and identifying the recurrence relation. Each layer is defined by the expression \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer step by step starting from the innermost one.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the outermost layer (Layer 9) as 29524, we multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Wait, no. Let me check the original problem again. It starts with 3*(...), so the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So, the inner expression is up to Layer 9, which is 29524. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60,000 9000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572.

So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's it.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to verify.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that again: 3*29524.\n\nLet me do this multiplication step by step:\n\n3 * 20000 = 60000\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000\n\n3 * 500 = 1500\n\n3 * 24 = 72\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 directly.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I feel like 88572 might be a bit large. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI think I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3) is the first layer.\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1+3(...)\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nWait, actually, each time we have a new set of parentheses, so let me count the number of \"1+3(...)\" sections.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first (1+3(...)), each time it's a new layer. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, each time it's (1+3(...)), so let's count:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\nLayer 3: (1+3(Layer2))\nLayer 4: (1+3(Layer3))\nLayer 5: (1+3(Layer4))\nLayer 6: (1+3(Layer5))\nLayer 7: (1+3(Layer6))\nLayer 8: (1+3(Layer7))\nLayer 9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, and then the outermost is 3*(Layer9). So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers. So, the result is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but I feel like that's a very large number, and sometimes these problems have a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer. Let me think if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is known. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula:\n\na_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^n - 1)/(k - 1)\n\nIn this case, k=3, c=1, and a_0=4 (Layer1). Wait, no, actually, Layer1 is the first term, so perhaps a_1=4, a_2=13, etc. Let me adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nThe general formula for a linear recurrence a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1)\n\nBut in our case, a_1=4, so a_0 would be the term before a_1, which is not part of our layers. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of it starting from n=1.\n\nAlternatively, let me model it as starting from n=1: a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc.\n\nThen, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1: a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the outermost layer is Layer9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the formula because I might have made a mistake in the general formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThe solution we found is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nYes, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is similar to a geometric series.\n\nBut regardless, since both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern of a linear recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from this recurrence, we determine that the value of the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again. 29524 * 3: Let's do it step by step. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go back:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, so each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait a second, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part is 1 + 3. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after computing all layers up to Layer 9, which is 29524, and then multiplying by 3, I get 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is linear and non-homogeneous. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the closed-form expression, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f. So, that's another way to compute it directly. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form solution. Each layer \\(a_n\\) follows the formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final step would be: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, the final result should be 88,572.

Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm, so maybe I didn't make a mistake. But just to be thorough, let me check Layer 9 again. Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Correct.

So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me think about this again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we're adding 1 and then tripling the result. So, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without having to compute each layer manually. Let me see if I can find a pattern or perhaps a recursive formula.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n=1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for L_n. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nLooking at the recursion: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let's assume the particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, after verifying with both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Correct. Layer 6: 3*364=1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093=3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Okay, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n, which would save time instead of computing each layer. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4=3C -1/2. Solving for C: 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just cross-verify with another approach. Maybe expanding the expression step by step. Let's try to compute the innermost parentheses first and work our way out. Starting with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4)=1 +12=13. Next layer: 1 +3*(13)=1 +39=40. Next:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Next:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Next:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Next:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Next:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Next:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After evaluating all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer's result, which equals 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, we have: 3*(29524) = 88572 Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct.

Finally, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me check the multiplication: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, each layer was computed correctly, and the final result is 88572. I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula that could have gotten me there without computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in one of the steps. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Suppose L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction. But all our layers have integer values. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check again. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let's try to solve it using the standard method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which is correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct again. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since our expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got when I computed Layer 9 manually. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, same as before. So, using the formula confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. I think this problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It's cool how a seemingly complex expression can be broken down into manageable steps or even solved with a formula once you identify the pattern.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

So, the final computation would be: 3 * (Layer 9) = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 3 times 29524. Hmm, let's break that down: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = (20000*3) + (9000*3) + (500*3) + (20*3) + (4*3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate. Let me verify each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern that allows me to compute it more quickly, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually isn't too bad. However, if the number of layers were larger, maybe there's a formula I could use. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 here. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = (L_0 - b/(1 - a)) * a^n + b/(1 - a). Wait, let me check that formula. For a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Hmm, but in our case, L_1 is given as 4, so maybe L_0 would be 1? Let me think. If n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is L_1 = 1 + 3, which would correspond to L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0, where L_0 = 1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_0 = 1. Then, the solution to this recurrence is L_n = (L_0 - c) * a^n + c, where c = b/(1 - a). Wait, maybe I should derive it step by step. Let me solve the recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_0 = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_0 = 1: 1 = A*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = A - 1/2 => A = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^{10} = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524.

Okay, so each step checks out. I think I did this right. It's interesting how each layer builds upon the previous one, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers. It's almost like a geometric progression, where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. But since each term is 1 plus three times the previous term, it's a bit different. Let me think about whether there's a formula for such a sequence. Suppose we have a recursive formula where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each term is defined based on the previous one. Solving such a recurrence relation might give a closed-form formula, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually is manageable. However, if there were more layers, we might need a different approach. But in this case, nine layers are okay to compute step by step. So, I think my approach was correct, and the answer is 88,572.

Hmm, let me calculate that. 3 times 29524. Let me break it down: 3*29524 = 3*(29000 + 524) = 3*29000 + 3*524. 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. So adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, which is a geometric progression of sorts. It's similar to expanding a series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. In fact, if I think about it, this is a recursive expression where each term is defined as a function of the previous one. Let me try to model this with a general formula. Suppose I define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches the layers I computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I know that such relations can often be solved using standard techniques. The general form of a linear recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c=3 and d=1. The solution to such a recurrence is given by a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c). Plugging in the values, a_1 = 4, c=3, d=1. So, a_n = (4 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Simplifying the denominator: 1 - 3 = -2, so 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. Therefore, a_n = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^{2} - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^8 is 6561. So, (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let's compute 9*6561: 6561 * 9. 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. Adding those together: 54000 + 4500 = 58500, 58500 + 540 = 59040, 59040 +9=59049. So, (9/2)*6561 = 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, I could have thought of this expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the sum of a geometric series. Let me see if I can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. Starting from the innermost term, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's denote the innermost term as x = 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each term is 1 + 3*x, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*x), and so on. But since I've already broken it down into layers, and each layer can be expressed using the recurrence relation, I think the approach I took earlier is more straightforward. However, it's good to know that both methods lead to the same result. Another way to think about it is that each layer is a term in a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost term, which is 4, each subsequent term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This kind of recursive structure is common in problems where each step depends on the previous one, and it's often useful to work from the inside out. I also remember that for such linear recursions, the closed-form solution can be found using the formula I used earlier, which avoids having to compute each term step by step. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each term wasn't too bad, and it gave me a concrete understanding of how the numbers build up. So, just to recap, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This is repeated nine times, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3 one final time. The result after computing all nine layers is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer, and I've verified it using both step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation. So, I feel confident that the result is accurate.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, this seems to be growing quite quickly. Let me continue this process for each layer. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9), so I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. Well, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this correctly. Each step built upon the previous one, and the numbers got larger each time because each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer, which leads to exponential growth. So, the final result is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident about this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus three times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is multiplied by 3. The step-by-step evaluation leads to the final answer of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. Wait, 9841 is 9000 + 841, so 3*9841=27000 + 2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3.

So, the result of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can write it in the form a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula that directly relates to the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think about that. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Each time, it's a 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*...). Since there are nine layers, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, perhaps this can be modeled as a geometric series. Let me try to see that. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Let me try to express E in terms of itself. Wait, but since each layer is similar, perhaps I can find a relationship. Let me see: If I denote the innermost part as x, then x = 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*x, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*x), and so on. But this seems similar to the recursive approach I took earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each time expanding the innermost term first. Let me write out the expansion step by step. Let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express each Layer n as a function of n. As I found earlier, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression E as a sum. Let me try expanding E:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try expanding this step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out one layer:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\n1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer:\n\nE = 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer adds a term that is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of powers of 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost term:\n\nAt Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*1 + 3*3 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nSimilarly, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3*1 + 3*3 + 3*9 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Hmm, but 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40? Let me check: 1 + 3 is 4, plus 9 is 13, plus 27 is 40. Yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\n\nWait, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121? Let me add them up: 1 + 3 is 4, +9 is 13, +27 is 40, +81 is 121. Correct.\n\nSo, each Layer n is the sum of 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4\n\nSo, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, which is a geometric series.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWhich matches the formula I found earlier: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression E is 3 times Layer 9, so E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of multiple powers of 3. Let me try to write out E:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nStarting with the innermost 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express E as a sum of powers of 3, but I'm not sure if that's necessary since I already have a formula and the step-by-step computation gives me the same result.\n\nLet me try to compute E directly by expanding all the parentheses. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, and there are nine layers, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers.\n\nIf I expand this, each 1 will be multiplied by 3 multiple times depending on its depth. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost 1, it's multiplied by 3 eight times before being multiplied by the outermost 3. So, the innermost 1 contributes 1*3^9.\n\nSimilarly, the next 1 is multiplied by 3 seven times, so it contributes 1*3^8.\n\nContinuing this way, the outermost 1 (just before the outermost 3) is multiplied by 3^0 (since it's only multiplied once by the outermost 3) and then multiplied by the outermost 3, so it's 1*3^1.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each 1 is inside n layers, so it's multiplied by 3^{n} times, where n is the number of layers above it. Since there are nine layers, the innermost 1 is inside eight layers, so it's multiplied by 3^8, then the next 1 is inside seven layers, so multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is inside zero layers, so multiplied by 3^0.\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, no. Because each 1 is being added and then multiplied by 3 each time. So, perhaps it's better to model it as a sum where each 1 is multiplied by 3^{number of layers above it}.\n\nWait, let me try again. Let me consider each 1 in the expression:\n\n- The innermost 1 is at depth 9 (counting from the inside out), so it's multiplied by 3^8, because it's inside eight layers of multiplication by 3.\n\n- The next 1 is at depth 8, so multiplied by 3^7.\n\n- This continues until the outermost 1, which is at depth 1, so multiplied by 3^0 = 1.\n\nBut then, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). Wait, but let me verify.\n\nWait, the innermost 1 is at depth 9, so it's multiplied by 3^8, then the next 1 is at depth 8, so 3^7, and so on, until the outermost 1 is at depth 1, so 3^0.\n\nTherefore, the sum inside the parentheses is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, E = 3*(sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k).\n\nThe sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k is (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, n=8, so sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nThen, E = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, that's not matching the earlier result. Wait, this can't be correct because earlier I had E = 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm modeling it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in my earlier step-by-step computation, the outermost layer was Layer 9, which was 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524, and then E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut according to this sum approach, I'm getting E = 3*9841 = 29523, which is different. So, I must have made a mistake in this approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is nine, so the sum should be from k=0 to k=9, not k=0 to k=8.\n\nWait, let me think again. The innermost 1 is at depth 9, so it's multiplied by 3^8, because it's inside eight layers. The next 1 is at depth 8, so multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is at depth 1, so multiplied by 3^0.\n\nTherefore, the sum inside the parentheses is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, because there are nine terms (from k=0 to k=8). So, sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nThen, E = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the earlier result of 88572. So, I must be making a mistake in how I'm modeling the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the way I'm counting the layers is incorrect. Let me count the number of 1s in the expression.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a 1, so starting from the innermost, there are nine 1s. So, each 1 is at a different depth, with the innermost being depth 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed step by step, I had Layer 1 as 1 + 3, Layer 2 as 1 + 3*(Layer 1), etc., up to Layer 9, which gave me Layer 9 = 29524, and then E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, when I tried to model it as a sum, I got E = 3*9841 = 29523, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the sum approach. Let me think again. Let me try to write out the expansion step by step, but in terms of powers of 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nEach time, the value is 1 + 3*(previous value).\n\nIf I expand this all the way, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nSo, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers.\n\nIf I expand this, each 1 is multiplied by 3 a certain number of times. Let me try to compute how many times each 1 is multiplied by 3.\n\nThe innermost 1 is multiplied by 3 eight times (since it's inside eight layers) and then by the outermost 3, making it 3^9.\n\nWait, no. Let me think carefully. Each time you go out a layer, you multiply by 3 once. So, the innermost 1 is inside eight layers, so it's multiplied by 3 eight times, and then by the outermost 3, making it 3^9.\n\nWait, but when I computed it step by step, the innermost 1 was contributing 3^8, because it was inside eight layers, but in the final E, it's multiplied by 3 again, making it 3^9.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the confusion. Let me see.\n\nIn the step-by-step computation, each layer's 1 is multiplied by 3 a certain number of times. For example, Layer 1's 1 is multiplied by 3^8, because it's inside eight layers, and then by the outermost 3, making it 3^9.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 2's 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to Layer 9's 1, which is multiplied by 3^0 (since it's not inside any layers beyond its own).\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had Layer 9 as 29524, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I model E as 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k), then sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841, and then E = 3*9841 = 29523, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to compute E directly by expanding all the terms.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nNext:\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer:\n\nE = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model E as a sum of 3^{n} terms.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Each time you have 1 + 3*(...), it's equivalent to 1 + 3*(previous sum). So, perhaps each layer is adding another term in a geometric progression.\n\nWait, if I consider each layer as adding a new term, then after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see that each 1 in the expression contributes 3^{k}, where k is the number of layers above it.\n\nSo, the innermost 1 is in the ninth layer, so it's multiplied by 3^8, then the next 1 is in the eighth layer, so 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is in the first layer, so 3^0.\n\nThus, the sum inside the outermost parentheses is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, which is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841.\n\nThen, E = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier result of 88572.\n\nWait, I must be making a mistake in the way I'm counting the layers or the exponents.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is that the sum inside the outermost parentheses is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k, and then multiplied by 3, so E = 3*(sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k) = 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 ) = (3^{10} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: (3^{10} - 3)/2 = (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523.\n\nBut that's not matching the step-by-step result of 88572.\n\nWait, so there's a discrepancy here. I must be missing something in how I'm modeling the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each 1 is being multiplied by 3 a different number of times. Let me try to model it correctly.\n\nLet me consider each 1 in the expression and how many times it's multiplied by 3 before being added.\n\nStarting from the innermost 1:\n\n- The innermost 1 is inside eight layers, so it's multiplied by 3 eight times, then by the outermost 3, making it 3^9.\n\n- The next 1 is inside seven layers, so multiplied by 3 seven times, then by the outermost 3, making it 3^8.\n\n- This continues until the outermost 1, which is inside zero layers, so multiplied by 3^0, then by the outermost 3, making it 3^1.\n\nTherefore, the sum inside the parentheses is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^{k+1} = 3*sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k.\n\nWait, that's 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k). So, sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is (3^9 - 1)/2 = 9841, then multiplied by 3 gives 29523, and then multiplied by the outermost 3 would give E = 3*29523 = 88569, which is close to 88572 but not exactly.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier step-by-step gave me 88572. There's a discrepancy of 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a miscalculation. Let me compute (3^{10} - 3)/2 again.\n\n3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 - 3 = 59046. Divided by 2 is 29523. Then, 3*29523 = 88569, which is 3 less than 88572.\n\nWait, that's odd. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of terms.\n\nWait, let me go back to the step-by-step computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, according to this, E = 88572.\n\nBut according to the sum approach, I'm getting E = 3*(sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k) = 3*(9841) = 29523, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the sum approach. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the step-by-step, the sum inside the outermost parentheses is Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nBut according to the sum approach, sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is 9841, which is Layer 9.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 3*9841 + 1? Wait, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Oh! That's it.\n\nSo, the sum inside the parentheses is sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k = 9841.\n\nBut Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the sum approach gives me the value inside the parentheses as 9841, but Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I think the confusion was that the sum from k=0 to 8 of 3^k is 9841, which is Layer 9 without the outermost 1 + 3*... part. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, and then E is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, both methods agree when properly applied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but I need to be careful about how the layers are structured.\n\nIn any case, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute the multiplication:\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. To solve it, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2.

Let me compute each layer step by step, keeping track as I go.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by this Layer 9 result. So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with so many digits. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17. Write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7, 7, 2, 7, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3 = ?\n\nLet me compute it as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n represent the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula\u2014I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think this is correct. Let me just double-check the closed-form formula to make sure I applied it correctly.\n\nGiven a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9, that's (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression without breaking it into layers. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nCompute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n\nFinally: 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with both methods. I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) step by step, but in a more compact way.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define the innermost as term1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nterm2 = 1 + 3*term1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nterm3 = 1 + 3*term2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nterm4 = 1 + 3*term3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nterm5 = 1 + 3*term4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nterm6 = 1 + 3*term5 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nterm7 = 1 + 3*term6 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nterm8 = 1 + 3*term7 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nterm9 = 1 + 3*term8 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*term9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, all methods point to the same result.\n\nI think I've got this. The answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me calculate that: 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Now, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Hmm, but I have a feeling that maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count them: 1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first 3, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sections: Starting after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, the first layer is the innermost: 1+3, then each step out adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the opening parentheses after the initial 3: 1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first opening parenthesis after 3 is the start of the first innermost layer. Then, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count how many \"1+3(\" there are after the initial 3: 1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears after the initial 3. Let's see: After 3, we have (1+3(...)), then inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting after the initial 3, each \"(\" is a new layer. Let's count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3, the number of opening parentheses is 9. Wait, let me count: 1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first \"(\" after 3 is layer 1, then each subsequent \"(\" is another layer. So, the number of layers is 9. Therefore, I correctly computed up to layer 9, resulting in 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake because 88572 seems like a big number, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be solved using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} So, A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Simplifying: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of 3^{n} as well. Let me think. The original expression is 3*(L_9). Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Hmm, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900 + 180 +12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 +2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the result is 88572. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2 wraps around that, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that would be 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let's think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 =4. Solving for A: 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer. Since a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, 88572. Therefore, I think that's the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering the layers, it might make sense. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if that approach would work. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). This looks like a recursive structure where each term is defined as 1 + 3*previous term. So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I did earlier. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Since there are nine layers, we compute up to a_9, then multiply by 3. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, n = 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but the way it's structured here, it's more of a nested multiplication. So, using the recursive approach or solving the recurrence relation both lead to the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because that seems a bit high. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it all together: 88572. Hmm, that's the same result as before. Wait, but let me confirm with another method. Maybe using distributive property: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. But wait a second, did I count the layers correctly? Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine sets of (1+3(...)), so each layer corresponds to one of these. So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, up to Layer 9 being the one just before the outermost 3. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that was the innermost part, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 3*29524 = 88572. But wait, let me check if I miscounted the layers. Let me write out the structure: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's list each layer again to make sure: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Suppose I define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for a_9. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Alternatively, let me see if I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that confirms the result again. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 20,000 is 60,000. 3 times 9,000 is 27,000. 3 times 500 is 1,500. 3 times 24 is 72. So adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I compute 3*29524, I can do it directly: 29524 * 3.

Let me check Layer 9 again: 3*9841=29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Then 3*29,524: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute it as 30,000 *3=90,000, but 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 30,000*3=90,000, minus 476*3=1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428=88,572. Yep, that checks out. So, my final answer is 88,572. Wait, but I just noticed something. The original expression is 3*(...).

I think that's correct. But wait, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way to confirm. Perhaps using the formula for a geometric series or recognizing a pattern that could simplify the computation. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier values to ensure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Now, since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10 first. 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by expanding each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me double-check the multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n(4*3)=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n(2*3)=6 +1=7\n(5*3)=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n(9*3)=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n(2*3)=6 +2=8\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*29524 as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That also checks out.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, that's 40. Then Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Let me break this down: 3 * 29524 = 3 * (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding these: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 0*3=0, write down 0. 2*3=6, write down 6. So, reading it from top to bottom: 6 0 0 0 0 7 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so 29524 * 3 should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me try again: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry over 0.\n\nNow, the next digit is 9 (from 29524?), wait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, the digits are:\n\nPosition 1: 4\n\nPosition 2: 2\n\nPosition 3: 5\n\nPosition 4: 9\n\nPosition 5: 2\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u21927, carry 0.\n\n5 *3=15\u21925, carry1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28\u21928, carry2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8\u21928, carry0.\n\nNow, since we're done with all digits, the carry is 0, so we don't add anything else. So, the result is 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88572, which matches my earlier result. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I did this correctly, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach or check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Hmm, looking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series but with each term being 3 times the previous plus 1. Wait, let's see: Let me define the expression recursively. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C =1 \u2192 C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which matches a_4=121. Okay, so the formula seems correct. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the a_9 I computed earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which is what I got before. So, this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is solid. I used two methods: the recursive step-by-step expansion and the closed-form formula from the linear recurrence. Both led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is multiplied by 3. Using both step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula derived from a linear recurrence relation, the result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see if I can find a pattern here or perhaps a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let's compute a few more layers to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original problem starts with 3*(...). So, the final computation would be: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, the total would be 88,572. Wait a minute, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you compute step by step, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recalculate Layer 9 and then the final multiplication. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29,524. Let's compute that again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using the concept of geometric series or recursion. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can write this as 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2,187 3^8 = 6,561 3^9 = 19,683 3^10 = 59,049 3^11 = 177,147 So, 3^{11} is 177,147. Then, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, after computing L_9, which is the outermost layer, I think the entire expression is 3 multiplied by L_9. But wait, let me check the structure again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, after computing up to L_9, which is 1 + 3*L_8, the entire expression is 3*L_9. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 29000*3 = 87000, 524*3 = 1572, so total is 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the result should be 88,572.

L_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, wait, earlier I wrote 1 + 3*40 = 121, but 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is indeed 121. Correct. L_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure no arithmetic errors. L_1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L_2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L_3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to error, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about the recursive relation here. Each layer L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. In this case, a = 3, b = 1. So, the solution would be L_n = 3^n * L_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, what is L_0? Because in our case, L_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, if n=1, L_1=4. So, let's see if we can express L_n in terms of n. Let me adjust the formula. Let me define L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, etc. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, for n \u2265 2, with L_1 = 4. So, we can write L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9. Wait, no, n=9 is L_9, but the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, substituting, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a recursive pattern where each layer is defined as $L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}$. Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until we reach the outermost one. \n\nUsing the recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as $L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$. For the outermost layer ($n=9$), this gives $L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524$. Multiplying this result by 3, as per the original expression, yields the final answer:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final step is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3 times 29524. Hmm, 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 24 is 72. Wait, but that's not the right way to break it down. Maybe I should compute it directly. 29524 * 3: Let's do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, carry over 0. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000 = 49524, 49524 + 9524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the total is 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer was computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. It's a geometric progression kind of situation, but since each step is dependent on the previous, it's better to compute each layer step by step. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me check a couple of the layers again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that all checks out. I think I've got the right answer here. It's interesting how each layer builds up exponentially. Each time, the number is tripling and adding one, so it's growing quite rapidly. But by computing each layer step by step, it's manageable. I didn't try to find a formula or anything, just straightforward computation, which worked fine. I guess another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is computed using that recurrence relation. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 88572. Yeah, that's another way to model it, using recursion. But since the problem only has nine layers, it's feasible to compute each one manually. If there were more layers, maybe I'd look for a pattern or a formula to compute it more efficiently. But for nine layers, step-by-step is okay. Just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first opening parenthesis after the 3, each subsequent opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let's count them: Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost: (1+3) is layer 1, then each additional (1+3( adds another layer. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" before the closing parentheses. The innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the total number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. So, layer 1: innermost, layer 9: outermost. So, my computation of 9 layers is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated step by step. After computing all nine layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3 * 4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3 * 13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3 * 40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3 * 121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3 * 364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3 * 1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3 * 3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3 * 9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 4 is 12. Wait, but that's breaking it down, but maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n88572\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3 times 4 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 3 times 2 is 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. 3 times 5 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 3 times 9 is 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 3 times 2 is 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. 3 times nothing (since we're at the end) is 0, but we have the carried 2, so write down 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me do it again more carefully:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\nNo more digits, but we have a carryover of 2, so write that down.\n\nWait, that would give 88572, but let me check again because I think I might have messed up the placement of the digits. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute 29524 \u00d7 3 directly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- 5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Wait, but 29524 \u00d7 3 is actually 88572, right? Let me verify with another method. Let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3. 30000 \u00d7 3 = 90000. 476 \u00d7 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.

Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, all the layers check out. Each step seems correct, so I think my answer is right. I guess the key here was to approach the problem methodically, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. Each layer builds upon the previous one, so taking it step by step prevented me from getting lost in the complexity of the expression. It's also a good idea to double-check each layer to ensure there are no calculation errors, especially when dealing with larger numbers. Overall, breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts made it much more approachable. I didn't realize it at first, but recognizing the pattern allowed me to tackle each part individually without feeling overwhelmed. So, yeah, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Well, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, it's 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a miscalculation. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation, a closed-form formula is derived, confirming the result. The final computation is 3 multiplied by the outermost layer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
