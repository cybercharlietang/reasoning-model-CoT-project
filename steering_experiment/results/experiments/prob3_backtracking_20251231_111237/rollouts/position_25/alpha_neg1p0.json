So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, each layer was computed by taking the previous layer's result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then moving outward. Each step built upon the previous one, and by the time I got to Layer 9, I had a large number, which when multiplied by 3 gave me the final result. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer. Let me try to compute each layer step by step up to Layer 9. Let me make a table to keep track:\n\nLayer | Calculation | Result\n-----|-------------|-------\n1    | 1 + 3       | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*4     | 13\n3    | 1 + 3*13    | 40\n4    | 1 + 3*40    | 121\n5    | 1 + 3*121   | 364\n6    | 1 + 3*364   | 1093\n7    | 1 + 3*1093  | 3280\n8    | 1 + 3*3280  | 9841\n9    | 1 + 3*9841  | 29524\n\nWait, hold on, let me check my calculations because that seems a bit off. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me just cross-verify this because the numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 88572.\n\nHmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1. But the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, which matches our previous calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. I cross-verified each step, and the formula approach also leads to the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using this pattern, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon that. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Then, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, the final step is to compute 3 * Layer 9. That would be 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 29000 * 3 = 87000, and 524 * 3 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or maybe a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, each term is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form of a linear recurrence relation is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants. In our case, c = 3 and d = 1. The solution to such a recurrence relation is given by: a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c) Wait, but in our case, c = 3, which is greater than 1, so 1 - c = -2. Let me write the formula properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence relation: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me verify the computation of 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 +72=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer. The key was to recognize the pattern and either compute each layer step by step or find a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's do that step by step. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Let me check. The entire expression is 3*(...), so yes, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. So, 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute this step by step. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, then 1 + 3*40 = 121, then 1 + 3*121 = 364, then 1 + 3*364 = 1093, then 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, then 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply that by 3 to get 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. I can also check the multiplication at the end again: 29,524 * 3.

Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, the final result should be 88,572. Let me just verify my computations step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Let me check 29524 * 3 again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer seems to be of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, we can set up a system of equations: 3A + B = 4 9A + B = 13 Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, substituting A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Let me compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, as per the formula, the innermost expression is a_1 = 4, and each layer adds another 3*... So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. I think I've got this right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way out. Using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula confirms that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the outermost part is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 So, putting it all together, each layer builds on the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's almost like each layer is following a geometric progression. Wait a second, let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, for each layer, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I write out the terms: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to recognize that this is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model it that way. The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and then finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but 3*a_9 is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\n3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost term, 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like each layer is adding another power of 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding it:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I expand each layer, starting from the inside:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each time, we have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation as I did before, leading to a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see:\n\nIf I expand the expression, each time distributing the 3, I get:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nEach time, expanding one layer gives 3*1 + 3*3*(next layer). So, in the end, it's like 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some term.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLet me try expanding the entire expression step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\n3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 =12\n\nThen, moving one layer out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) =3*(1 + 12)=3*13=39\n\nNext layer:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))=3*(1 + 3*13)=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120\n\nWait, but that's not the same as before. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the layers.\n\nWait, actually, each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each expansion adds another term.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k, but I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a geometric series with ratio 3, but let me check.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(E')), where E' is a similar expression with one less layer. But since the expression has multiple layers, maybe I can find a pattern.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation as I did before, since each layer builds on the previous one, and the formula using the recurrence relation gives me the correct result.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with the recurrence relation, I find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the final result by 3 to get the overall value.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

So, the final step is: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that checks out. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, but 3*364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. So, Layer 6: 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. 3*1,093: 3*1,000=3,000; 3*93=279; so total is 3,279. Plus 1 is 3,280. Correct. Layer 7: 3,280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,000=9,000; 3*280=840; total 9,840. Plus 1 is 9,841. Correct. Layer 8: 9,841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 3*9,000=27,000; 3*841=2,523. So, 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Plus 1 is 29,524. Correct. Then 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2,187; 3^8=6,561; 3^9=19,683; 3^{10}=59,049. Therefore, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, the closed-form approach confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis is one layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer adds another set, so up to Layer 9. So, I think I did that correctly. But just to be absolutely sure, let me write out each step again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote L_n as the value of Layer n. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give a formula, which could be useful for verification. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step: 29524*3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 2*3=6, write down 6. So, reading the digits from bottom up: 6, 8, 8, 7, 5, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me do it more carefully:\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8, carryover 0.\nThe next digit is 9 (wait, no, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4). Wait, actually, let's write it out properly:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0.\nNext digit:5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\nNext digit:9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\nNext digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8, carryover 0.\nNo more digits, so write down the carryover 0 if any, but here it's 0. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. I think that's solid. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a formula for the layers, which gave me the same result.

    "text": " 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this. It seems like each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to compute a few more layers to see if I can spot a pattern. Layer 3: 40, as above. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the result of Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number. Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait a second, let me just think again about the structure of the problem. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have nine layers. So, starting from 1 + 3, then each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That actually resembles the formula for a geometric series. Let me recall that a geometric series has the form S = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^(n-1). But in this case, each term is being multiplied by 3 and added 1. It's more like a recurrence relation. Specifically, each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Substituting the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Now, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my previous result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093.

Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524. Well, 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 4 is 12.

So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go back and verify each step. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This seems similar to a geometric series, but it's nested rather than summed. Let me recall that for such nested expressions, each layer can be represented recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. Similarly, f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, with f(1) = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*f(9)=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Now, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, adding 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Wait, let me check the original problem again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression, which after expanding all layers, we found Layer 9 to be 29524. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let's do that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, just to recap, each layer is computed by taking the previous layer's result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then using that for the next layer. Starting from the innermost, which was 1 + 3 = 4, each subsequent layer built upon that, leading up to the outermost layer being 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, giving 88572. I think that makes sense. Each step was straightforward once I broke it down, and by computing each layer step by step, it wasn't too bad. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, as far as I can tell. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's see. 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 24 * 3 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that seems right. I think I did this correctly. Each layer builds on the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a geometric progression, but each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Maybe something like a recurrence relation. Let's see, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each a_n is the next layer. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n. But in this case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3. Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the innermost expression after 9 layers is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any calculation errors, and the formula checks out. So, yeah, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those together: 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the final result should be 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct). Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, that's the same as before. Maybe I was just doubting myself unnecessarily. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, where a=1 and b=3. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + (L_0*b - L_0)/(b - 1). Wait, actually, let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*b^n, and the particular solution is L_n^p = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = a + b*K => K - b*K = a => K*(1 - b) = a => K = a/(1 - b). But since b > 1, this would be negative. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is built by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1, this is similar to a geometric progression. Let me see. Let's write out the first few terms: L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n... and so on.\n\nIf I expand L_n, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I expand all the way, it's like 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to n terms. Wait, no, because each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, actually, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which leads to L_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}. Wait, is that correct? Let me check for n=1: L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1 = 4. For n=2: L_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. For n=3: L_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*(1 + 12) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Wait, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40? Let me compute: 1 + 3 = 4; 4 + 9 = 13; 13 + 27 = 40. Yes, that's correct. So, in general, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. But wait, for n=1, it's 1 + 3^1 = 4. For n=2, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 13. For n=3, it's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. So, yes, L_n is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0=1 up to 3^n. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S_n = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, so S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divide by 2: 59048 /2=29524. That matches the Layer 9 value I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572, which is what I got before. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, Layer 9 is (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, which is 3*(sum_{k=0}^9 3^k). Wait, no, because each layer adds another 3, so actually, the total sum inside would be sum_{k=0}^9 3^k. Let me compute that sum: sum_{k=0}^9 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/(3 -1)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.

Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern or a formula for such expressions. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given the recurrence: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Wait, let me check. The original expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the entire nested expression. So, actually, after computing Layer 9, we have to multiply it by 3. Wait, no. Let me look again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2 is 1+3*4=13, and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time there's a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, each layer is one more. So, from the innermost, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(...). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do the multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Wait, that seems a bit high, but let me double-check. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yeah, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4 (Layer 1). Then, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*Layer9=88572. Yeah, that seems consistent. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, just to confirm. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*b^{n} + (a/(b-1)), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the solution is L_n = b^{n} * L_0 + a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1). Wait, but in our case, L_1=4, not L_0. Let me adjust. Let me set n=1: L_1=4. Then, for n=2: L_2=1 + 3*4=13, which matches. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >=2, with L_1=4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1}=0, which has the solution L_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition: when n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. So, that's good. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. I think this makes sense. The nested structure forms a geometric progression, and using the recurrence relation helped me find a formula to compute the innermost layers without having to calculate each one step by step, which would have been time-consuming, especially if there were more layers. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). Solving this recurrence relation, we find that each layer \\( L_n \\) can be expressed as \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the innermost 9 layers, \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's compute that. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, 29524*3=88572. So, the result of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then 3*29524=88572, correct. Okay, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be faster and less error-prone. Let me just try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead. Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Starting from Layer 1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recurrence is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence relation is: Layer n - 3*Layer(n-1) = 1. The homogeneous solution is Layer n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Layer n = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Layer 1 = 4. So, when n=1, Layer 1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches Layer 2. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me continue this process. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364.

Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 30000*3=90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. Wait, maybe it's better to compute 29524*3 directly. Let me do that: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1=4. Then each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation.

So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. I can break this down: 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can compute 3*29524 directly. Let's do that to verify. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, I think my answer is correct. The key here was to break down the nested expressions starting from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward. Each layer was dependent on the previous one, so I had to compute each step carefully. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 3 times 29,524. Let me do that step by step. 29,524 * 3: 24 * 3 = 72, write down 2 and carry over 7. 52 * 3 = 156, plus 7 is 163, write down 3 and carry over 16. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 16 is 43, write down 3 and carry over 4. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 4 is 10, write down 0 and carry over 1. There's nothing left, so write down 1. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check that again. 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together, it's 88,572. Wait, that doesn't match my previous calculation. Let me double-check. 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*         3\n----------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. Let me compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer should be 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, especially with the exponents. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Correct. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Then, 3*29,524=88,572. Yep, that seems solid. Alternatively, I can compute 3*29,524 as 29,524*3. Let me do that again to be thorough. 29,524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, 88,572. Correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, putting it all together: 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each layer again quickly.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if that's a geometric progression or something else. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from L_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the formula derived from the recurrence relation confirms the step-by-step computation.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Wait, no, that's breaking it down too much. Alternatively, 29524 * 3.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

Wait, let me verify that again. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them step by step. 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 20000=49524, 49524 + 9000=58524, 58524 + 500=59024, 59024 + 20=59044, 59044 + 4=59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000=79048, 79048 + 9000=88048, 88048 + 500=88548, 88548 + 20=88568, 88568 + 4=88572. So yes, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps again because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make any errors.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, when expanded, each term is 3^k * 1, summed up. Let me try to see that. Let me consider a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with n layers. So, expanding a_n, it's 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... + 3^{n-1}*1. Wait, but that's a geometric series. The sum would be (3^n -1)/(3 -1) = (3^n -1)/2. But wait, earlier I had a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Wait, let's see. If a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then expanding, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this way, it would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n}*a_0. But a_0 would be undefined here because our initial condition is a_1=4. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Alternatively, maybe the formula I derived earlier is more accurate, given that a_1=4 and a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=1, (3^2 -1)/2=4, which matches. For n=2, (3^3 -1)/2=13, which also matches. So, it's correct. Therefore, the 9th layer is (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. I think I'm confident that this is the correct answer now. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula approach gave me the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using a closed-form formula derived from this recurrence, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Computation**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
