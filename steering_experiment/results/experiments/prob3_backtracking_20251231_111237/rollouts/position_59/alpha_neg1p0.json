Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. So, 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) That's 9 layers, so yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one.

Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Let me check that again: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, 2*3=6+1=7, 5*3=15, 5, carry over 1; 9*3=27+1=28, 8, carry over 2; 2*3=6+2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations for each layer because if I made a mistake in one layer, it will propagate all the way through. Let's go through each layer again to make sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524 * 3 once more to be absolutely sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting after the first 3, each (1+3(...)) is a layer. Let me count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, because each time we have 1+3(...), and it's repeated 9 times. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost before the initial 3. So, my computation up to Layer 9 as 29524 is correct, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote a_n as the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 would be the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, as before. So, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n, then compute a_9 and multiply by 3.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula, which gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct answer.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I feel confident that 88572 is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value until reaching the outermost layer. Multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(another similar expression)}\\).

Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, writing it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 *3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think if I can model this as a geometric series or something. Let's see, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a recursive relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try solving it that way. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me find the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, there are 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014direct computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014give the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each a_n is defined recursively. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is known. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard method to solve it is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, then the entire expression is 3*a_n where n=9, so 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Plugging n=9: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3*59049 -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this.

After computing all layers, we multiply the outermost value by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term).

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

That seems correct. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed each layer, I ended up with 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first opening parenthesis after 3, each subsequent parenthesis adds another layer. Let's count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1+3(...)\" sections. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each \"1+3(...)\" adds a layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. So, layer 1 is the innermost, layer 9 is the outermost. So, when I computed up to layer 9, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Wait, but let me check my calculations again, just to be sure. Let me compute each layer once more: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, maybe this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. Now, let's see if we can find a formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula to compute L_9 directly without computing each layer. Since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Either way, the result is the same. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Correct) Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so it's a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to solve it as a linear recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the equation: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...). Each layer adds another set. Let me see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. The innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1.\n3. Then each step out adds another layer, so up to layer 9, as I did before.\n\nYes, so 9 layers in total, each computed correctly. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for layer 9. So that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my previous calculation. So, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the inside out, and then verifying with a recurrence relation approach, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the next inner layer.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, in case I made a mistake in the layers or if the problem is longer. Wait, actually, this expression is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, in general, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I also get 88572, which confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think that's thorough enough. I considered both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach, and both led me to the same answer. It's always good to verify with a different method to ensure accuracy, especially with problems that involve multiple layers of operations.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. 0 + 5 = 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. So, 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if I messed up any layer, the subsequent layers would be wrong. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, yes, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's denote L1, L2, L3,..., L9 as the layers. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we saw earlier, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can express it as Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. The homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume Ln^p = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Layer 9 is (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2, then 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent, because 3^10 is 59049, right? Let me confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. So, Layer 9 is (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. 3^11 is 3*3^10 = 3*59049 = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step seems to check out, both by computing each layer step by step and by using the recurrence relation formula. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in any of the previous steps. Starting over, computing each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do this step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's a good check. Now, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572, as before. Alternatively, using the formula: Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, yeah, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression.

Let me compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in the computations.

Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, each layer seems to be correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n=9. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). This is a recursive expression, and perhaps it's similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. So, the recurrence relation is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} for k >= 2, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Suppose L_k = A*3^k + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} => A*3^k + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{k-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^k + 3B. So, left side: A*3^k + B. Right side: 1 + A*3^k + 3B. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^k + B = 1 + A*3^k + 3B. Subtract A*3^k from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When k=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplify: L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For k=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that the result is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I might have just computed each layer step by step, which I did earlier. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach corroborates the step-by-step method.

Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which resembles a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolve for C: C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => 2C = -1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1.\n\nBut in our case, the expression has 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9.\n\nWait, actually, let me check: The original expression is 3*(...), where the innermost part is 1+3, which is a_1 = 4, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nGiven that, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each a_n follows a geometric progression, we can compute it without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut in this case, since there are only 9 layers, manually computing each step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the general approach for more complex problems.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and the recurrence relation.\n2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n3. Alternatively, model the recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution to compute directly.\n4. Multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same final answer, which is 88,572. So, I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost 1 + 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in the previous steps. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364.

Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524. As before, 29524*3=88572. So, all layers check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Hmm, but just to make sure, perhaps I can approach this problem differently. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, so it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. I remember that such linear recurrence relations can be solved using a formula. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_{n+1} = k*a_n + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Let me verify that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*k^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = k*B + c => B - k*B = c => B(1 - k) = c => B = c/(1 - k). So, the general solution is a_n = A*k^{n} + c/(1 - k). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*k^{1} + c/(1 - k). So, A = (4 - c/(1 - k)) / k. Wait, maybe I should write it more carefully. Let me consider the recurrence a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the next inner layer.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the carry-over.

Wait, but let me confirm that 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go back through each layer's computation to double-check.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer's computation seems accurate. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation here. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I don't need to go that far since I already computed each layer step by step. However, it's interesting to note that each a_n is growing exponentially because each term is multiplied by 3. So, the numbers get large very quickly, which is why the final result is in the tens of thousands. Another way to think about this is that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer, but since I was working through it step by step, it was a good exercise to compute each layer manually first. It's also a good reminder of how recurrence relations can model such nested expressions and how to solve them. In summary, by either expanding each layer step by step or by recognizing the pattern and solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29,524, which we calculated as 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's easier to solve it as a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we get the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each nested layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the number is 88572. So the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Let me verify my steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any of them. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400, 29400 + 120=29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or something similar, but given the structure, it's a repeated multiplication and addition, so the step-by-step approach is probably the most straightforward. Let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So starting from 1 + 3, each time we're computing 1 + 3*(previous result). This seems similar to a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost. So a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, this confirms the earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n, but given that n is only 9, it's probably not necessary. But just for fun, let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it directly. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation, the closed-form formula confirms the result. \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n3. Continue this process for each of the nine layers.\n4. Multiply the result of the ninth layer by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me try to find the particular solution. Assuming a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction, but our layers are integers. Maybe that's okay. Then, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with the layers I computed earlier: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divide by 2:177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think I've verified it multiple ways: step by step computation, using the recurrence relation, and even finding a closed-form formula for the layers. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer 1. Each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of layers: Starting from the innermost, each time we have a new (1+3(...)). Let's see: The innermost is (1+3). Then moving out, each time we have another (1+3(...)). Let's count the number of times we have (1+3(...)): Let me write the structure:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\nLayer3: (1+3(Layer2))\nLayer4: (1+3(Layer3))\nLayer5: (1+3(Layer4))\nLayer6: (1+3(Layer5))\nLayer7: (1+3(Layer6))\nLayer8: (1+3(Layer7))\nLayer9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that's correct. So, I have 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think my computation is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Let me just confirm with a different approach to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's exactly what I computed earlier. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can solve the recurrence relation more formally. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with the initial condition \\(a_1 = 4\\), we compute up to the ninth layer, which results in \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, these numbers look familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Wait, these numbers look like they're following a pattern similar to powers of 3 or something related. Let me check: 4 is 3 + 1, 13 is 3*4 + 1, 40 is 3*13 + 1, etc. So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That is, Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is known. Let me recall: For a recurrence relation of the form Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, the solution is Ln = a^n * (L0) + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. So, if I can find L0, then I can compute Ln directly. But in our case, L1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. So, let's see: Let me define L0 as the starting point. If n=1, L1 = 4. Then, according to the recurrence, L1 = 3*L0 + 1 = 4. So, 3*L0 + 1 = 4 => 3*L0 = 3 => L0 = 1. So, L0 = 1, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, etc. So, using the formula: Ln = 3^n * L0 + 1*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n * 1 + (3^n - 1)/2. So, Ln = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Perfect, so the formula holds. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L9. So, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, L9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divided by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using the recurrence relation, we find that the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the 9th layer, this gives (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1=1+3=4. L_2=1 +3*L_1=1+12=13. L_3=1 +3*L_2=1+39=40. It seems like each layer follows the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. So, in general, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n -3*L_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Substituting into the recurrence: L_p =3*L_p +1 => L_p -3*L_p=1 => -2*L_p=1 => L_p= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10=59049. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=87572. So, the final answer is 87,572. Wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=87572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Since each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's similar to a geometric series. Let me see. If I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))). If I expand each layer, it's like 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))). Let me try to write this as a sum. Let me denote the innermost term as T=1+3=4. Then, moving out, the next term is 1 +3*T=1+12=13. Then, next is 1 +3*(1 +3*T)=1 +3*13=40, and so on. So, each term is 1 +3*previous term. So, as I found earlier, each layer is a term in a geometric-like sequence, which can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2 for the nth layer. So, with n=9, we get L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and then 3*29524=87572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 87,572. But just to make sure, let me try computing one more layer manually to see if my formula holds. Let's take n=5. According to the formula, L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which matches my earlier computation. So, yes, the formula is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 87,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the outermost layer (n=9), L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{87572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check Layer 8 again because when I computed 3*3280, I thought it was 9840, which is correct because 3000*3=9000 and 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 9840 +1=9841. Then Layer 9: 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the expression starts with 3(1 + ...). So, each layer is inside another 3(...). So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) sections.\n\nLooking at the original problem:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" starts a new layer. Let me count how many times \"3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, each time we have a \"3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times \"3(\", but the innermost one is just 1+3, so perhaps the layers are 9 in total. So, my earlier computation with 9 layers is correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, that gives 88572. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find the solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for Layer 1, n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nLayer 2, n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches.\n\nLayer 3, n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, this formula seems to work.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9, which is the outermost one, would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. But using the recurrence relation and solving it seems more efficient.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try to compute Layer 9 using the formula and then multiply by 3.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. But just to make sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, just once more.\n\nCompute Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nLayer3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough times. It seems that the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8. So, adding up: 40000 + 18000 = 58000, +1000 = 59000, +40 = 59040, +8 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524.

Wait, that's different from 88572. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in my multiplication earlier. Let me try again. 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit properly. 29524 is:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiply each by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in the multiplication or addition. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n, starting from the innermost as L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. Hmm, maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see, since each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. Wait, but our initial term is L_1 = 4, which is when n=1. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Alternatively, let me write down the terms: L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1 (since the innermost is 1 + 3). Wait, actually, maybe L_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, as I had before. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^p = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. \n\nAfter computing each layer, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, which might form a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nAnd the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo,\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D\n\n= 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSo, we have:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1\n\nSo, D = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition to find C.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the formula gives a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n= 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after verifying through both step-by-step computation and using a closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I was able to find a formula that gives the value of the innermost expression directly, which then allowed me to compute the entire expression efficiently. This approach avoids the tedious step-by-step computation of each layer and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is effectively building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. However, the recurrence relation method worked well because each term depends linearly on the previous one, allowing for a straightforward solution.\n\nIn summary, by methodically breaking down the problem and recognizing the underlying pattern, I arrived at the solution without getting lost in the complexity of the nested expressions.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3(...). By recognizing the recurrence pattern, we can compute each layer step by step or use a closed-form formula. \n\nUsing the recurrence relation:\n- Each layer \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n- The general solution is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\nFor \\( n = 9 \\):\n- \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n- \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is one layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer).

But when I computed earlier, I only went up to Layer 9. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me see. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside is (1 + 3(...)), which is Layer 1. Then inside that is another (1 + 3(...)), which is Layer 2, and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses inside, each starting a new layer. So, that would be 9 layers, not 10. Because each 3(1 + ... is a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9)\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me look again.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as each time you have a 1+3(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nHow many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression, each time after the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, perhaps it's 9 layers. Wait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I was correct the first time, that there are 9 layers, so the final answer is 88572. Let me just confirm by another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nA particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had 9 layers leading to a_9 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIf we have n layers, then the total expression is 3*a_n.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The first layer is a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3.\n\nThen, the second layer is a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nSo, the nth layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I miscounted the number of layers earlier. Let me just confirm how many layers there are in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nEach time, we have another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses: each (1+3(...) is a new layer.\n\nTherefore, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1).\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8).\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, n=9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've double-checked each layer, and the formula approach also gives the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\( 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times\\) Layer 9, which is \\(3 \\times 29524\\).\n\nCalculating \\(3 \\times 29524\\):\n\\[\n29524 \\times 3 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Wait, 29524 is:\n\n- Units place: 4\n- Tens place: 2\n- Hundreds place: 5\n- Thousands place: 2\n- Ten-thousands place: 9\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2\n\nWait, no, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\n- 4 (units) *3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 (tens) *3 = 6 +1 =7. Write down 7.\n- 5 (hundreds) *3 =15.

So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm whether I computed each layer correctly because that's a lot of layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 was 1 + 3, which is 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Wait, let me check that formula again. Actually, for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. In our case, c = 3, d = 1, and a_1 = 4. Wait, but our initial term is a_1 = 4, so perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted. Alternatively, maybe it's better to model the layers as starting from a_0 = 1, and then each layer adds another 3*(...). Hmm, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Let's see. If I have a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is indeed a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). But in our case, a_1 = 4, which is the first term. So, let's adjust the indices. Let's say that a_0 is the initial term before the first layer. So, a_0 = 1, because the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. Then, using the formula for the linear recurrence, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^{n}*1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplifying, a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that formula with n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. Correct. n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Each set of parentheses adds a layer, starting from the innermost. So, starting from the innermost 1+3, which is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Since we have nine sets of parentheses, that would correspond to n=9 layers. Wait, no, because the innermost is a_1, and then each outer layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's another way to approach it, using the formula for the linear recurrence relation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding it out, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). But since each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit more involved. However, using the formula we derived earlier, it's straightforward to compute the value without expanding each layer. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we determine that the value of the entire expression is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. Let's try that. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence relation: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers: For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f So, it seems the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without having to calculate each layer manually, which is much more efficient. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check by considering if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the nth term. If I denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, left side: A*3^{n} + B. Right side: A*3^{n} + 3B +1. Equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B +1. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 3B +1. So, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A -1/2 =4. So, 3A = 4 +1/2= 9/2. Therefore, A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Alternatively, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2= (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. It was a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me write down the recursion: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, indeed, the same as before. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n in this recursion. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The recursion is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the closed-form formula. It's reassuring that both methods give the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the closed-form formula lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, writing each layer's value as I go.

So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can try computing it in a different way or look for a pattern or formula that could represent this nested structure.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me think: Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. For n > 1, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, c = 1 and r = 3. So, the solution to this recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous recurrence because of the constant term 1.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that confirms it again.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple times, both by computing each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations. Both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe denote each layer as \\(a_n\\), where \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\).
