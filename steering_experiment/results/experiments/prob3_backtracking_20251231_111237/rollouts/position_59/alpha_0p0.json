Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.

Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check for any errors.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. I've heard of something called a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the next layer is 1 + 3*(this layer), and so on. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one.\n\nLet me define it as a recurrence relation. Let a_n be the value of the nth layer, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, the problem is to compute a_9, then multiply by 3. Wait, no, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the 9th layer. Wait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, perhaps I can model this recurrence relation and find a closed-form formula to compute a_n without computing each layer step by step. That might save time, especially if n were larger.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nAt n = 1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it's correct.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nFor n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSince we're dealing with n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By breaking it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. This forms a recurrence relation, which can be solved using a closed-form formula. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final result is 88572. But wait, I just realized that when I was computing Layer 9, I might have made a mistake.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which would have saved time and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, this is a linear recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This kind of recurrence can be solved using the method for linear non-homogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 Correct. So, the formula seems to hold for the first few layers. Therefore, we can use this formula to compute a_9 directly. a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result. I think I've double-checked each step, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be simplified by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, we find the value at the 9th layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a repeated structure where each term is \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\) the next nested term. This can be modeled as a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation**: Let \\( a_n \\) represent the value of the nth layer. The relation is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\n   \\]\n   with the initial condition \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the Recurrence**: The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Compute \\( a_9 \\)**: Substitute \\( n = 9 \\) into the formula:\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times \\( a_9 \\):\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Maybe by adding 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = Let's compute that:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nAdding units: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry over 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry over 1.\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo the sum is 88572. Wait, that's different from the previous result. Hmm, so which one is correct? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication earlier.\n\nLet me check 29524 * 3 again. Maybe I miscounted the digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number. Let's break it down:\n\n29,524.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nAh, so the correct result is 88,572, not 87,572. I must have miscounted the digits earlier. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so that means my earlier step where I thought Layer 9 was 29,524 is correct, and then 3 times that is 88,572. So, that's the final answer.\n\nBut let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and 3 times that is 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. That seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a formula. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth layer. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3 * L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3 * L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. That's the same result as before.\n\nSo, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've got it right. The final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern in the expression. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer starting from the innermost one.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe outermost expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\). Therefore, we compute:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, just to verify. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then the total expression is 3*L9.\n\nLooking at the recursion here, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p(n) = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4.

Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might help. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also think about the problem in terms of a geometric series. Each layer adds another power of 3, but since it's nested, it's not a simple sum. The closed-form expression using the recurrence relation seems to be the right approach here. Alternatively, if I think about expanding the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which is similar to an infinite series, but since it's finite with nine layers, the closed-form expression still applies. So, yeah, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\) and each subsequent layer is computed as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1.

The entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer \\( a_9 \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step manually isn't too bad. But just to explore, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Next, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. So, to recap, by recognizing the pattern and finding a closed-form formula, I can compute the result without having to manually calculate each layer, which would be especially useful if the expression had more layers. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, both methods work fine. I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct as well. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's it. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step helped. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's add them up.\n\nFirst, 29524 + 29524: Let's add 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 20000 = 49524, then +9524: 49524 + 9524.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)) with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I computed up to Layer 9, which is correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have nine layers, n = 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, and 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to be absolutely certain. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but in this case, since the expression is nested, the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer. By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a formula. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values we have. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me try to write it out. Let\u2019s denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine 1's. Wait, actually, in our problem, there are nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) where the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, maybe I can think of E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). But perhaps using the formula we derived earlier is easier. Since each layer L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 10, but I'm not sure. Let me see: The expression inside the outermost 3 is 1 + 3*(...), which is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, E = 3*L_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's consistent with everything else. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

I think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, I think. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + s*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, comparing to the standard form, r = 3 and s = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe it's better to write it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. That gives me confidence that it's correct. I think I've solved it correctly. The answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe result of the computation is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost layers, we find that Layer 9 is 29524.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off. Let me check again: 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12.

Let me correct that. Wait, 29524 is:\n\n- 2 ten-thousands\n- 9 thousands\n- 5 hundreds\n- 2 tens\n- 4 units\n\nSo when we multiply by 3:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carryover 0\n- Hundreds:5*3=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n- Ten-thousands:2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carryover 0\n\nSo the result is 88572.

So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Because if I messed up any layer, the final answer would be wrong.\n\nStarting again, Layer 1:1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have 9 layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 3(...): Starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3 is Layer1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer. Let's see:\n\nInnermost:1+3 (Layer1)\n\nThen, each step out adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 is used.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nStarting with a1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\nThen a2=1 +3*a1=1 +12=13\n\na3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40\n\na4=1 +3*a3=1 +120=121\n\na5=1 +3*a4=1 +363=364\n\na6=1 +3*a5=1 +1092=1093\n\na7=1 +3*a6=1 +3279=3280\n\na8=1 +3*a7=1 +9840=9841\n\na9=1 +3*a8=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me just verify one more time, because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric progression. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nEach term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1=4.\n\na1= C*3^1 -1/2=3C -1/2=4\n\nSo, 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1} starting from a1=4, and that this leads to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, and that the solution can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which for n=9 gives 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer as we go. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). \n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So 88572. Wait, that seems too high. Wait, let me check my multiplication again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait, earlier when I was computing Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me confirm that Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+\" is a new layer. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Then moving out, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a new layer. So how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 (Layer 1)\n\nThen, wrapping that: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) (Layer 2)\n\nThen, wrapping that: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) (Layer 3)\n\nContinuing until Layer 9.\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 layers? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) parts.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of 1 + 3*(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 (Layer 1)\n\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer 1) (Layer 2)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer 2) (Layer 3)\n\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer 3) (Layer 4)\n\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer 4) (Layer 5)\n\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer 5) (Layer 6)\n\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer 6) (Layer 7)\n\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer 7) (Layer 8)\n\n9. 1 + 3*(Layer 8) (Layer 9)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 9 layers. So, my earlier computation is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just feel that 88572 is a very large number. Let me check if I made a mistake in the multiplication at the end. 29524 * 3. Let me compute it again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 by breaking it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the layers because each step built upon the previous one correctly, and the final multiplication checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about this problem is to recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression. Let me see if that's the case. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation leading to a closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Each step logically follows from the previous one, and the closed-form solution corroborates the iterative computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way out. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That's a recursive relation. So, if I can find a closed-form expression for Layer n, that might save time, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me try to model this recursion. Let's denote L(n) as Layer n. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recursions. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4. So, when n=1, L(1)=4= C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Now, 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the result is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows a pattern. Using a formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers get large quickly, and sometimes it's easy to make a multiplication error.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, finally, 3*29524.

So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. To find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, L_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the intermediate steps. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then each term is defined recursively. Let me compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, yeah, that's the same as before. So, multiplying a_9 by 3 gives the final result. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. In this case, c = 1, r = 3. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_1 - c/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1}. Wait, let me think again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, since each a_n is defined as a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and even used the recursive formula and the closed-form expression to confirm. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, yes, that seems correct. Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an error in the layers. Let's see, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me think about it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence, the closed-form solution would be a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me verify that. Let me see, for n=1: a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but wait, a_1 is 4, so that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial condition. Let me think again. Wait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, let's compute a few terms using the recurrence and see if we can find a pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1=4; n=2, a_2=13; n=3, a_3=40; and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms our answer.

I computed each layer step by step up to Layer 9, which gave me 29,524. Then I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result of 88,572. I think that makes sense.

Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication: 29524 \u00d7 3. Alternatively, 29524 \u00d7 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it directly without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only nine layers, either method works. I think I've double-checked it enough. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer's value, which is 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. When I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me make sure that was correct because each step depends on the previous one. Let me go back through each layer again to check for any calculation errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple layers, you might miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of times the pattern repeats.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1+3(...)\" sections. Starting from the innermost: Each time you have 1+3(...), so how many times does this happen? Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the first layer is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(previous), and so on until the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nEach time, it's one more layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nFrom the original expression, the structure is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of times we have \"1+3(\":\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3(...\n2. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" sections:\n\n1. The first is 1+3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another 1+3(...\n...\nEach time, it's a new layer. So, let's count how many times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n- The first is 1+3(1+3(...)\n- Then another 1+3(...\n- Continuing until the outermost.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\nLayer3: 1+3(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer9.\n\nWait, because each time we have a new \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. So, in the original expression, how many \"1+3(\" are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n- After the first 3(, we have 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on until the last 1+3( before the closing parentheses.\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer1. Then each time we have a 1+3(, that's a new layer. So, let's count:\n\n1. Layer1: 1+3\n2. Layer2: 1+3(Layer1)\n3. Layer3: 1+3(Layer2)\n4. Layer4: 1+3(Layer3)\n5. Layer5: 1+3(Layer4)\n6. Layer6: 1+3(Layer5)\n7. Layer7: 1+3(Layer6)\n8. Layer8: 1+3(Layer7)\n9. Layer9: 1+3(Layer8)\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3(1+3(...)), so Layer9 would be the innermost, and then Layer1 would be the outermost? Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the innermost is the first one we computed, which is Layer1: 1+3. Then Layer2 wraps around Layer1, and so on, until Layer9 is the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the layers reversed. Let me clarify:\n\nThe innermost parentheses is the first 1+3, which is Layer1. Then, moving outward, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3 around the previous layer. So, Layer2 is 1+3*(Layer1), Layer3 is 1+3*(Layer2), etc., up to Layer9, which is the outermost 1+3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...), starting from Layer1 as 1+3, up to Layer9 as the outermost. So, my initial computation was correct, with Layer9 being 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my approach is correct. Let's say we have 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). How would that compute?\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1+3=4\n\nNext layer: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nOutermost: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*40=120.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nYes, that works. So, using the same method, the larger problem should also work. Therefore, I can be confident that my computation is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer follows the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nFirst, rewrite the recurrence:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 4 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value after n layers is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier for Layer9. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let's compute a smaller n using the formula and see if it matches.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, as in the earlier small example.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for n=9, it's 29524, and multiplied by 3 is 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using this recurrence relation, we compute each layer up to the ninth, which results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is 3 times the previous plus 1, so maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, we can see that this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that confirms it.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the nth term is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric progression, so maybe I can model it that way. But since I've already verified it with both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific recurrence relation.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem starts with 3 times the entire expression, which is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that would be 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. So, the problem is essentially computing a_9 and then multiplying by 3. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), I can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572. Thus, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can also think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer adds a term that is 3^n, but let me see. Wait, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is the same as sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k, because sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. But in this problem, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which does build up to the sum of a geometric series. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is the sum of a geometric series from 3^0 to 3^9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, after all these methods and checks, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a recursive formula and verifying with a geometric series approach, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

So I think the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without expanding each layer, but since the number of layers is manageable (only nine), expanding step by step works fine. But just for my own understanding, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. I think the general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572, as before. So using the formula, I can compute it without expanding each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work. It's good to know both ways: step-by-step expansion and using the recurrence relation with the formula. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just verify one more time using the formula. L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Each layer follows the recurrence relation:\n\n\\[ L_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_{n-1} \\]\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot L_9 = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Write 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again:\n\nWait, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when multiplying by 3:\n\n4 (units) * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 (tens) * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 (hundreds) * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 (thousands) * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands) * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo writing from the top: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So the result is 88572. Wait, but let me verify that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems similar to a geometric series, but it's nested. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, each L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1 = 4. So, when n=1:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with Layer 1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, the final result is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 3^10 again to be sure. 3^10 is 59049, correct. Because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute each layer without having to compute each step manually, which would save time, especially if there are more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given the nesting, it's more efficient to use the recursive approach or the formula I derived.\n\nJust to recap, the steps I took were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result as I went along.\n\n3. After computing all layers up to Layer 9, multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\n4. Realize that the recursive relation could be solved with a formula, which I derived and tested against known values to ensure correctness.\n\n5. Applied the formula to Layer 9 and then multiplied by 3 to confirm the result.\n\nSo, through both iterative computation and applying a formula, I arrived at the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work sufficiently. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. \n\nUsing the recursive formula \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\), we compute each layer up to \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"
