    "text": " So, units digit is 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems off. Let me check again: 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the number is 88572. Hmm, but wait, 29524 * 3: 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting over: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such expressions to see if it's a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a linear function. Let me recall that for such a recurrence, the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now that I've gone through them again and also used the recurrence relation method to verify.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " So units digit is 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, tens place is 7, carryover 0. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, hundreds place is 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, thousands place is 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, ten-thousands place is 8. So putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something because the numbers are growing quite rapidly. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me define a sequence a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, the expression we're trying to compute is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_1 through a_9: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, that's the same result as before. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term. Since each term is defined recursively by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * (a_0 - d/(1 - c)) + d/(1 - c). In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * (a_0 - 1/(1 - 3)) + 1/(1 - 3). Wait, but a_0 is not defined here because our sequence starts at a_1. Let me adjust the indices. Let me consider a_0 = 1, so that a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. Then, the general solution would be a_n = 3^n * (a_0 - 1/(1 - 3)) + 1/(1 - 3). Plugging in a_0 = 1: a_n = 3^n * (1 - 1/(-2)) + 1/(-2) = 3^n*(1 + 1/2) - 1/2 = 3^n*(3/2) - 1/2. Simplifying: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the terms I've already computed: For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10 = 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or find a closed-form expression, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the multiple methods all converge to the same number. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to have an off-by-one error or miscalculate a multiplication. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

So, each layer seems to compute correctly. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n is 9 because there are nine sets of parentheses starting from the innermost. Wait, actually, let me count: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, the total number of layers is 9. So, the general form would be a recurrence relation where each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer, starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{k} = 1 + 3*L_{k-1} for k >= 2. So, we have L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_k. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = A*3^k + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go back through each layer computation to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, computing each one isn't too bad. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant. To find B, we can solve for the steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = B. So, B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B = -1/2. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2. Using the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4.5 => A = 1.5. So, the solution is a_n = 1.5*3^{n} - 0.5. Then, a_9 = 1.5*3^9 - 0.5. Let me compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, a_9 = 1.5*19683 - 0.5. Compute 1.5*19683: 1*19683=19683, 0.5*19683=9841.5, so total is 19683 +9841.5=29524.5. Then, a_9=29524.5 -0.5=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach give me the same result.

Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Outermost: 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, compute it step by step: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*1)) = 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. That's correct.

Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Another way to approach it might be to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the sequence is a recurrence relation. Let's see if that works:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13\n\na_3 =1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40\n\na_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +120=121\n\na_5=1 +3*a_4=1 +363=364\n\na_6=1 +3*a_5=1 +1092=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*a_6=1 +3279=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*a_7=1 +9840=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*a_8=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A = 1 + 3*A => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C =4 +0.5=4.5 => C=4.5/3=1.5=3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Yes, that matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88,572. Therefore, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding the innermost parentheses first and working outward.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, computing each step isn't too bad. But just for curiosity, maybe I can find a general formula for such expressions. Let's see, the expression seems to follow a recursive pattern where each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution, L_n^{(p)}. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula directly: The total expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*((3^{10} -1)/2) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, each layer is computed starting from the innermost part. The expression can also be solved using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. Both methods lead to the same result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carryover. Next: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me confirm that I computed each layer correctly. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=3, d=1. Let me check that. Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, so in this case, yes, c=3, d=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, actually, I think the formula is a bit different. Let me make sure. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Then, the particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula seems to hold. So, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using this formula. Let's see. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result: 88572. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can compute it step by step by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So the digits are:\n\n- Units: 2\n- Tens: 7\n- Hundreds: 5\n- Thousands: 8\n- Ten-thousands: 8\n\nSo, the number is 88,572. Wait, 88,572 is 88 thousand 572, which is correct because 3*29,524 is 88,572. So, yes, 88,572 is the correct result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started from the innermost parentheses, which was 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). So:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and I didn't see any errors in the calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

    "text": " So units digit is 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 (tens place) *3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) =7, write down 7. Next digit: 5 (hundreds place) *3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit:9 (thousands place) *3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit:2 (ten thousands place) *3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 *3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yeah, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, maybe this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. Let's find C. When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + C => 3A + C=4. Also, as n approaches infinity, the homogeneous solution would dominate, but maybe I can find C by finding the steady-state solution. Alternatively, solving the recurrence: The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^(p)=K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding it all the way, maybe it's a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me try to see: If I have a_9 =1 +3*a_8, and a_8=1 +3*a_7, and so on. So, expanding all the way, a_9=1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...)))=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^8 +3^9. Wait, no, that's not exactly correct because each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Let me see: a_1=4=1+3=3^1 +1? No, 3^1=3, 3+1=4. a_2=1 +3*a_1=1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13=3^2 + something? 3^2=9, 13=9 +4, which is 3^2 +3^1 + something. Wait, maybe it's a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}. If I unroll this, a_n=1 +3*(1 +3*a_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this, a_n=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3*a_{n-3}. So, in general, a_n= sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*a_0. But wait, a_1=4=1 +3*a_0. So, if a_0 is defined as 1, then a_1=1 +3*1=4. So, a_n= sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k -1? Wait, maybe not. Let me see, when n=1, a_1=4=1 +3=3^0 +3^1=4. When n=2, a_2=13=1 +3 +9=13. So, 3^0 +3^1 +3^2=1+3+9=13. Similarly, a_3=40=1 +3 +9 +27=40. Wait, 1+3+9+27=40? Wait, 1+3=4, +9=13, +27=40. Yes. So, a_n= sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is the formula we found earlier. So, for a_9, it's sum_{k=0}^9 3^k= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. I'll compute 3*29524 again: 29524*3: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches.\n\nGood, so the formula seems correct.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, and both give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Using the closed-form formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find a_9 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So yes, 88572. Wait, but earlier when I broke it down as 3*(29524), I think I confused the layers. Let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let's go through each layer again to confirm:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc. So, in general, a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When k=1, a_1=4. So:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer k, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, there are 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the general formula, since a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_k = 3*(3^{k+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{k+2} - 3)/2.\n\nIn our case, k=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI count 9 sets of parentheses inside the main 3(...). So each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So yes, 9 layers, so a_9.\n\nWait, but when I numbered the layers earlier, I started from the innermost as Layer 1, so a_1 = 4, a_2=13, etc., up to a_9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nJust to double-check, perhaps I can compute a few layers using the formula to see if it matches.\n\nFor example, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works, which gives me more confidence that a_9=29524 is correct, and thus the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the general formula lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Starting from the innermost: Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(1+3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them: Starting from the first (1+3, then each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let's see: The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Each time, it's 1+3 followed by another (.... So, the first one is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1), Layer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost one. Wait, but when I counted earlier, I had 9 layers, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me try to write down the expression with indices: Layer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1+3\nThen, each subsequent layer:\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost one.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many times does 1+3 occur?

So, let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3(1+3, there are 8 more opening parentheses, each adding another layer. So, total layers from the innermost to the outermost would be 9 layers. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had 9 layers, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time adding another 3*(previous layer). So, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me list each layer with its corresponding computation:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression after the first 3(1+3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first (1+3, each subsequent ( adds another layer.

So, that means there are 9 layers, each corresponding to a 1+3(...) expression. So, Layer 1 is the innermost 1+3, and Layer 9 is the outermost 1+3(...). Therefore, my earlier computation is correct, with Layer 9 being 29524, and the final result being 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely certain, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and I don't see any arithmetic errors in the computations. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, can be assumed to be a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step. That might have been more efficient, especially if the number of layers was larger. But for nine layers, either method works. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used to compute this without having to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is correct. So, the general formula for a_n would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer adds another a_{n}. Wait, actually, in our problem, the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is 1 + 3*a_8, and so on. But according to the formula, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to go through each layer. That's a good check. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3, so maybe there's a formula I can use. Let me try to see if that's the case. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation would be r = 1 + 3r, which simplifies to 0 = 1 + 2r, so r = -1/2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the recurrence as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the original expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, so 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 as the innermost, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple recurrence, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " So, units digit is 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Tens place: 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12.

But wait, let me check my earlier computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Hmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try computing a few layers again to ensure consistency. Let's recompute Layers 1 through 3: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Now, let's check Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers compute correctly. Then, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's the right answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can try computing it another way. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=4. Wait, actually, a1 is the innermost, which is 4, and each subsequent a_n is built from that. So, if I write out the recursion, it's a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then the final result is 3*a9, which is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since it's a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which is a_n = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this for n=1: a1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. Using the recursive formula \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we compute up to \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long computation. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step. Alternatively, this might be a geometric series or something similar, but since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), it's a linear recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found, but since n is small (n=9), computing each term step by step is feasible. However, for the sake of understanding, maybe I can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a first-order linear recurrence, and its solution can be expressed as a_n = (a_1 + (1)/(3 - 1)) * (3)^{n - 1} - (1)/(3 - 1). Wait, let me recall the formula for such recursions. The standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c \u2260 1. The solution is a_n = c^{n}*(a_1) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). In this case, c = 3, d = 1, and a_1 = 4. So, substituting, a_n = 3^{n}*(4) + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Simplifying, a_n = 4*3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Combining terms: a_n = (8*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (9*3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, that seems promising. Let me test it with n=1: a_1 = (9*3^1 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Wait, but earlier, a_1 was 4. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Maybe my indexing is off. Wait, in the problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, but according to the formula, when n=1, a_1=13, which doesn't match. So perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me double-check the recurrence. The standard solution for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n -1}*(a_1) + d*(c^{n -1} - 1)/(c - 1). So, perhaps I need to adjust the formula. Let me rederive it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 3*4 +1 =13, a_3=3*13 +1=40, a_4=3*40 +1=121, which matches our earlier computations. To solve the recurrence relation, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)}=A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is a_1=4, but in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=1+3=4, which corresponds to n=1. Then, each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9. So, a_9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and the formula derivation also confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to find the value efficiently.

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Starting from L_1 = 4, as we computed earlier. Let's see if we can find a general formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous recurrence relation because of the constant term 1. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as we computed earlier. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10}/2) - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with the step-by-step calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} but I need to check if that's applicable here. Wait, let's see. Let's expand the innermost expression step by step. Let me try to see what the entire expression looks like when expanded. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each time, we have 1 + 3*(...), and each time, the ... is another similar expression. So, when we expand this, each layer adds a term. Let me try to write out the expansion for a smaller number of layers to see the pattern. Suppose we have just one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.\n\nIf we have two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 2 earlier, it was 13, which is the value before the outermost 3. So, in the two-layer case, the outermost 3 would give 3*13 = 39, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for three layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, let me do it properly. For three layers: The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, the outermost layer is 3*13 = 39. But if I have three layers, does that mean three sets of parentheses? Let me check:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(7)) = 3*(1 + 21) = 3*22 = 66. Wait, no, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. Each time, the number of layers corresponds to the number of times 3 is nested. So, the original problem has nine layers, each with a 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have n layers, the value would be L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, as before. But perhaps the total expression is 3*L_n, where L_n is the nth layer. So, in the case of n=1, the expression is 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nn=2: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nn=3: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*7) = 3*(1 + 21) = 3*22 = 66.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier formula, L_3 = 40, so 3*L_3 = 120. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, each time, the number of layers is the number of times you have 1 + 3*(...). So, in the problem, it's 3*(...), where the ... has 8 layers inside. Wait, no, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1).\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2).\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8).\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, in the problem, n=9 layers, and the total expression is 3*L_9, where L_9 = 29524, as computed earlier.\n\nBut when I tried n=3, I got a different result. Let me see where I went wrong. When I thought of n=3, I wrote 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*7) = 3*(1 + 21) = 3*22 = 66.\n\nBut according to our formula, L_3 = 40, so 3*L_3 = 120. So, there's a conflict here. Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Wait, in the problem, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, in the case of n=3, the expression would be 3*(Layer 3), where Layer 3 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2). But Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 1 = 4. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, the total expression is 3*40 = 120. But when I manually expanded it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))), I got 66. So, that's inconsistent. Therefore, I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps in the manual expansion, the number of layers is different. Let me see:\n\nExpression for n=3: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nThen, moving out: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, so that's correct. So, when I thought I was getting 66, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate that:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)).\n\nFirst, compute 1 + 3*4: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, compute 1 + 3*13: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I must have miscalculated earlier when I thought it was 66. So, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, L_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me try to expand the entire expression:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's try to expand it step by step, although it might be tedious.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me think about that.\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, if I expand it, it's like 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n, but I'm not sure if that's exactly the case here.\n\nWait, let's see. Let me try to expand the expression for a smaller number of layers to see the pattern.\n\nFor n=1: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 = 3 + 3^2.\n\nFor n=2: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nWait, 3 + 9 + 27 = 39. Yes, that's correct.\n\nFor n=3: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, no, that's the same as n=2. Wait, no, actually, for n=3, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*7) = 3*(1 + 21) = 3*22 = 66. Wait, but according to the sum of powers, 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120, which doesn't match. Hmm, so that approach might not be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: Each layer adds a term, but it's not a simple sum of powers. Alternatively, perhaps the expression can be represented as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, from our earlier formula, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the formula seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a geometric series. The expression inside each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be thought of as a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me see.\n\nIf I denote S_n as the sum, then S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}. Wait, that's the same as our earlier recursive formula. So, the solution we found earlier is correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute the layers again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, but let me verify my earlier steps because I feel like I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. That sounds like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2:59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to look at it is recognizing that the entire expression is a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. So, if we expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to see that. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) But this seems complicated. Alternatively, if I consider that each layer is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, then the entire expression is 3*L_9, where L_9 is as above. So, in any case, the result is 88572. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that seems correct? Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 500 = 88548, 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again. When I first saw the problem, I thought of starting from the innermost parentheses, which is correct, because otherwise, the expression would be ambiguous without proper parentheses. Each time, I'm replacing the innermost (1+3) with 4, then moving outwards, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's the pattern. So, after computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times that ninth layer. So, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems like a lot, but given the number of layers, it's plausible. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I recall that expressions of the form a + r*(a + r*(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a geometric series or recursive formula. In this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's try to find a recursive formula. L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. At n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. At n=0, if we consider L_0, which would be the base case before the first layer, but since our expression starts at L1, perhaps L0 is 1, but actually, the innermost layer is L1=4, so maybe L0 isn't defined here. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation as follows. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition at n=1, L1=4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms my earlier computation. So, the step-by-step process is to compute each nested layer from the innermost outwards, using the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L1=4, and then multiplying the outermost layer by 3. Alternatively, using the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we can directly compute L9 and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively calculating each layer, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward.

Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since our problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a recursive pattern, we can simplify each layer step by step. Using a closed-form solution derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value before the final multiplication is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(\" adds one. So, starting from the innermost, let's see: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost: 3(1+3(...))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct. But let me confirm each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29524 * 3 is 88572, yes. So, all the layers check out. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, where L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4, and L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) for n > 1. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L(n).\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that L(1) = 4, we can write:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nAnd for n=0, perhaps we can set L(0) = 1, but let me see. Wait, actually, when n=1, L(1)=4, so let's see if we can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute a few more terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nWe have:\n\nL(1) = 4\n\nL(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values we have:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. So, L(9) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as we found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula, the entire expression can be written as 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By expanding each layer from the innermost outwards, we compute each step until we reach the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each layer being 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the order. Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 units place: 2, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place: 7, no carryover. 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place: 5, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place: 8, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten thousands place: 8.

So, all the layers check out, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, I can notice that this expression is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is built as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. So, perhaps it's a form of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see. Let me denote the innermost term as a1 = 1 + 3. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on up to a9, and the total expression is 3*a9.\n\nSo, in general, an = 1 + 3*an-1, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for an = 1 + 3*an-1 is an = (3^{n} - 1)/2, but let me verify that.\n\nWait, let's see: For n=1, a1 = 4. Using the formula, (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, which is not 4. So, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is an = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTesting for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13.

So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula directly, I could have used 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that makes sense because 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, my initial digit-by-digit multiplication was correct, and the earlier addition was wrong because I added 29524 three times, but that's not the right way. It's better to do the digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. So, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer's computation seems accurate, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I might consider whether there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, starting from L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L(n). Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be written as:\n\nL(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The solution to this is L(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9: L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L(9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nBut in this problem, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. It's good to know both methods: the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation.\n\nSo, after verifying through both methods, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way out. Finally, we multiply the outermost result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Yes, so 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recompute each layer to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct) Layer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40 (correct) Layer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 (correct) Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 (correct) Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 (correct) Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 (correct) Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 (correct) Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524=88572 (correct) Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me see if this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 =1 +3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1), assuming r \u2260 1. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, and a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, so perhaps the formula is a bit different. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 =1 +3*4=13 a_3=1 +3*13=40 a_4=1 +3*40=121 a_5=1 +3*121=364 a_6=1 +3*364=1093 a_7=1 +3*1093=3280 a_8=1 +3*3280=9841 a_9=1 +3*9841=29524 So, the pattern is each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the general solution for such a linear recurrence is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1} =0, whose solution is a_n^{hom} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the equation: A =1 +3*A => A -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this confirms that the step-by-step computation is correct, and the formula gives the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break down the expression starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make this computation faster. Each layer seems to follow the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, Layer 2 = 13, Layer 3 = 40, and so on. I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term minus something. Wait, let me see: From Layer 1 to Layer 2: 4 to 13. 13 = 3*4 + 1. From Layer 2 to Layer 3: 13 to 40. 40 = 3*13 + 1. Similarly, Layer 3 to Layer 4: 40 to 121. 121 = 3*40 + 1. So, it seems like each Layer n = 3*Layer(n-1) + 1. That's an interesting pattern. So, in general, for each layer, it's 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That might be a geometric series or something that can be represented with a formula. Let me think about that. If I have a recurrence relation where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4, then this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the values I have: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*( (3^{n+1} -1)/2 ), where n=9: 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's a quicker way if I recognize the pattern. But since I was able to compute it step by step, that's reassuring. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me verify this multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, indeed, 88572.

    "text": " Wait, actually, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, 29524 * 3: Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 = 88572? Let me verify with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: Break it down as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me think about that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For Layer 1 (n=1): (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2 (n=2): (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. Layer 3 (n=3): (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is when n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, same result. So, that's another way to think about it, using the formula. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer).

    "text": " So, 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, we get 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, yes, it's 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that sometimes expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, it works. So, the general formula for L_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9, so: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 Therefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a multiple of 3 plus 1, and that the entire expression is a geometric series. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, and using the recurrence relation gave me a formula to compute the nth layer directly, which is efficient for larger n. But in this case, since n is 9, it's manageable either way. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is computed step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. By breaking down each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern of 1 plus three times the previous layer.
