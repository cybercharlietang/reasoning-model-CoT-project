    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to write it down step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. So, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That should be straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, I can replace the innermost part with 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(something). Since I just replaced the innermost part, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n2. So, 1 + 3*(4). First, compute 3*4, which is 12. Then, add 1 to get 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that.\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13). 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, this layer becomes 40. Continuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let's see.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute that.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, this becomes 364. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(364). Hmm, that's a bigger number.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, this layer is 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that. 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, add 1 to get 3280. So, this layer is 3280.\n\n8. Moving outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me calculate that. 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, add 1 to get 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, add 1 to get 29524. So, that layer is 29524.\n\n10. Now, moving out to the next layer, it's 1 + 3*(29524). Let me calculate that. 3*29524. Hmm, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. So, adding those: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, add 1 to get 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\n11. Now, the outermost layer is 3*(88573). Let me compute that. 3*88573. Hmm, 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Let's add these up: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 88573 times 3: 3*3 is 9, 3*7 is 21, 3*5 is 15, 3*8 is 24, 3*8 is 24. Let me write it out:\n\n   88573\n\u00d7      3\n---------\n   265719\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 265719. Let me recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a calculation error.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer was 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each time, it's 1 + 3 times the result from the previous step.\n\nLet me list all the intermediate results:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally: 3*88573 = 265719\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, and the calculations seem correct. I don't see any arithmetic errors in my steps. So, I think the final answer is 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this without having to compute each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, each layer a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, how many layers are there? Let's count. Starting from the innermost (1+3) as layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds one more. The original problem has 9 layers of 3*(...), so from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. Wait, actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...) parts.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is another layer. Let me count the number of 3s. The expression is: 3(...), and inside that, another 3(...), and so on. Let me see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2013 that's the first 3.\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)) \u2013 second 3.\n3. Continuing, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 starts a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of 3s. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nEach time, after the first 3, there's a 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the first 3, each inner 3 adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3 is the outermost.\n2. Then, each subsequent 3 is inside, so there are 8 more 3s inside. So, total layers would be 9? Wait, because from the innermost to the outermost, each 3 is a layer. Let me see:\n\nInnermost: (1+3) is layer 1.\n\nThen, each time we go out, we have another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, each 3 adds a layer. Let me count the number of times 3 is used as a multiplier.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by 8 more 3s. So, total 9 layers. So, n=9.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had 10 layers, from a_1 to a_10. Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, in my earlier step-by-step, I had 11 steps, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 =13, up to a_10 =88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nWait, but according to the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting after the first 3(, each subsequent ( is a new layer.\n\nSo, after the first 3(, there are 8 more opening parentheses. So, total layers would be 9, from the innermost to the outermost. So, n=9.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I had 10 layers because I started with a_1 as (1+3)=4, then a_2, up to a_10=88573, then multiplied by 3. So, perhaps n=9 layers, but in my computation, I had 10 layers because I included the outermost 3 as a separate step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify. The expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result after 9 layers. So, in the formula I derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, if n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had a_9 as 29524, which matches. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but in my step-by-step, I had 10 layers, ending up with 88573 before multiplying by 3. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me check again. According to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. But in my earlier step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. a_1 =4\n2. a_2=13\n3. a_3=40\n4. a_4=121\n5. a_5=364\n6. a_6=1093\n7. a_7=3280\n8. a_8=9841\n9. a_9=29524\n10. a_10=88573\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9 should be 29524, and then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 88572, not 88573 as I had in my step-by-step. So, I must have made a mistake in my step-by-step calculation.\n\nWait, let me check where I went wrong. Let me recount the layers.\n\nIn my step-by-step, I started with (1+3)=4 as a_1.\n\nThen, a_2 =1 +3*a_1=1+12=13\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40\n\na_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +120=121\n\na_5=1 +3*a_4=1 +363=364\n\na_6=1 +3*a_5=1 +1092=1093\n\na_7=1 +3*a_6=1 +3279=3280\n\na_8=1 +3*a_7=1 +9840=9841\n\na_9=1 +3*a_8=1 +29523=29524\n\na_10=1 +3*a_9=1 +88572=88573\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_10=3*88573=265719.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_9=29524, and then the outermost expression is 3*a_9=88572, which is different from my step-by-step.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts the layers differently. Let me think. The formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, where n is the number of layers. So, if the expression has 9 layers, then a_9=29524, and the outermost is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I ended up with a_10=88573, which is one more layer than the formula suggests. So, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(...) in the original expression. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of times 3 is followed by (1+3(...)). Starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 inside. Let me see:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)) \u2013 that's layer 1.\n\n2. Inside that, another 3(1+3(...)) \u2013 layer 2.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, after the first 3(, there are 8 more opening parentheses. So, total layers would be 9.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I had 10 layers, which suggests that perhaps the formula is considering the outermost 3 as part of the layers, whereas in reality, the outermost 3 is just multiplying the result of the inner expression.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n represents the value inside the nth layer. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_n, where n is the number of layers inside. So, in the original problem, the number of layers inside is 9, so a_9=29524, then the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I went up to a_10=88573, which is 1 +3*a_9=1 +3*29524=1 +88572=88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, is the outermost layer 3*(a_9), or is it 3*(1 +3*(a_8))? Let me check.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, (1+3)=4, then each layer is 1 +3*(previous). So, the first layer is 4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, and so on, up to the 9th layer, which is 1+3*(a_8)=a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step, I had an extra layer where I computed 1 +3*a_9=88573, then multiplied by 3. That seems incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake in my step-by-step by considering one extra layer. The correct number of layers inside the outermost 3 is 9, so a_9=29524, then the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but then in my step-by-step, I had a_10=88573, which would imply that the original expression has 10 layers, which contradicts the count. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers in the original expression.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting after the first 3(, each subsequent ( is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. After the first 3(, there's a (1+3(...)) \u2013 that's one opening parenthesis, so layer 1.\n\n2. Inside that, another (1+3(...)) \u2013 layer 2.\n\n3. Continue until the last (1+3). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. The first ( after 3 is the start of the first inner expression.\n\n2. Then, each subsequent ( is another layer.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n- After the first 3(, there's one (.\n\n- Then, inside that, another (.\n\nContinuing until the end.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count how many \"1+3(\" are there.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 1+3( adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...) \u2013 that's the first layer.\n\n2. Inside that, another 1+3(...) \u2013 second layer.\n\nContinuing until the end.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the number of 3s as the number of layers. The original expression has 9 instances of 3 followed by (1+3(...)). Wait, let me check:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( is another layer. Let me count the number of 3(:\n\n1. The first 3( is the outermost.\n\n2. Then, inside that, another 3( \u2013 second.\n\nContinuing until the last 3( before the innermost (1+3).\n\nWait, the innermost part is (1+3), which is layer 1. Then, each 3( adds a new layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3( in the expression.\n\nLet me count the number of 3(:\n\nStarting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( inside.\n\nSo:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(...\n\nContinuing until the end.\n\nWait, perhaps I can write the expression with indices:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, the number of 3( is 9. Wait, let me count:\n\n- The first 3( is the outermost.\n\n- Then, inside that, another 3( \u2013 that's two.\n\n- Continuing, each 3( adds one.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of 3( is 9, but the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let me count the number of times the pattern \"1 + 3(\" appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nStarting from the first 1+3(, let's see:\n\n1. The first 1+3( is inside the first 3(.\n\n2. Then, inside that, another 1+3(.\n\nContinuing until the last 1+3( before the innermost (1+3).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of \"1+3(\" is 9, meaning 9 layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost (1+3)=4 as layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds 1.\n\nIn that case, using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, with n=9, a_9=29524, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I ended up with a_10=88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. So, perhaps I included an extra layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is considering the outermost 3 as part of the layers, but in reality, the outermost is just a multiplier, not another layer. So, the number of layers inside the outermost 3 is 9, so a_9=29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I had 10 layers, leading to 265719. So, I must have made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, let me try to recount the layers properly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, (1+3)=4, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, layer 2 is 1 +3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had an extra layer where I computed 1 +3*29524=88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. That suggests that I considered 10 layers, but in reality, the original expression only has 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nSo, I must have added an extra layer by mistake in my step-by-step. Therefore, the correct number of layers is 9, leading to a result of 88572, not 265719.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my initial step-by-step. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, the original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))). So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9), where layer 9 is 29524. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. Layer 1:4\n\n2. Layer 2:13\n\n3. Layer 3:40\n\n4. Layer 4:121\n\n5. Layer 5:364\n\n6. Layer 6:1093\n\n7. Layer 7:3280\n\n8. Layer 8:9841\n\n9. Layer 9:29524\n\n10. Then, I did 1 +3*29524=88573, which is layer 10, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719.\n\nBut the original expression only has 9 layers inside the outermost 3. Therefore, I must have incorrectly added an extra layer in my step-by-step.\n\nSo, the correct result should be 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent with my initial step-by-step. Let me verify with the formula.\n\nUsing the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, with n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572, not 265719.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier detailed step-by-step. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I see the mistake. The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))). So, the outermost expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers of 1 +3*(...).\n\nSo, the innermost is layer 1:4.\n\nThen, layer 2:1 +3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572, not 265719.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a_10=88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. So, I think I included an extra layer by mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n=(3^{n} -1)/2, but let me check.\n\nWait, the formula I derived was a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, where n is the number of layers. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThus, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but that conflicts with my initial detailed calculation. So, I need to reconcile this.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me re-examine the recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThe solution I found was a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nLet me verify for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which is correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds for n=1 to n=9.\n\nThus, a_9=29524, and the outermost expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a_10=88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. So, I think I miscounted the layers, adding an extra layer beyond the 9th, which isn't present in the original expression.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the original problem again. It's written as:\n\nCompute\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, the number of 3s after the first is 8, making a total of 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nThus, the formula gives a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think I made a mistake in my initial step-by-step by considering an extra layer, which led to the incorrect result of 265719. The correct result should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the inside out and applying the formula for the recursive sequence, we find the result is"

    "text": " Let me try to parse this from the inside out because that might be easier. So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1+3). Let's compute that:\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from above)). So, substituting the result we just got:\n\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4)\n   - Compute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12\n   - Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so that layer gives us 13. Now, moving another layer out, it's (1 + 3*(result from previous step)).\n\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13)\n   - Compute 3*13: 3*13 = 39\n   - Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, so that gives 40. Let's go another layer out.\n\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40)\n   - Compute 3*40: 3*40 = 120\n   - Then add 1: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nOkay, moving on.\n\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121)\n   - Compute 3*121: 3*121 = 363\n   - Then add 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, that seems a bit bigger. Let me double-check that computation: 3*121 is indeed 363, and adding 1 gives 364. Okay, moving on.\n\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364)\n   - Compute 3*364: Let's see, 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092\n   - Then add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nHmm, so that's 1093. Next layer.\n\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093)\n   - Compute 3*1093: Let me break it down. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So total is 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279\n   - Then add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nWait, is that right? 3*1093 is 3279, yes, and adding 1 gives 3280. Okay, moving on.\n\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280)\n   - Compute 3*3280: Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840\n   - Then add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nAlright, so that's 9841. Next layer.\n\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841)\n   - Compute 3*9841: Let's compute this carefully. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523\n   - Then add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nNow, finally, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by this result. So:\n\n10. Outermost layer: 3*29524\n    - Let's compute this. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72\n    - Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 29524 * 3:\n  - 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n  - 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n  - 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n  - 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n  - 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n  - So, it's 88572. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each step gives us a larger number, and finally, multiplying by 3 at the end gives us 88572. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute incorrectly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)=4\n\n2. (1 + 3*4)=13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13)=40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40)=121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121)=364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364)=1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093)=3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280)=9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841)=29524\n\n10. 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's 10 steps, each corresponding to the 9 layers of parentheses plus the final multiplication. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards step by step.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Substitute the result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. Finally, multiply by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me try to write it out more clearly.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, it's 1 + 3, right? Then that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and this repeats multiple times. Maybe it's a recursive kind of structure. Let me try to parse it from the inside out.\n\nLet me count how many times the 1 + 3(...) appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result of step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result of step 2)\n4. And so on, until we have 8 layers? Wait, let me count.\n\nWait, looking at the original expression, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Hmm, I see 8 opening parentheses, so maybe there are 8 layers? Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo starting from the outermost 3(...), each layer adds another 1+3(...).

So L1 is the innermost expression, and each subsequent layer wraps around the previous one.\n\nSo, L1: 1 + 3\n\nThen L2: 1 + 3*(L1)\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2)\n\nAnd so on, until the outermost layer, which would be L9: 1 + 3*(L8), and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, no, because the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the total number of layers is 9? Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to work from the inside out. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9).

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other.\n\nWait, perhaps the innermost is 1+3, then next is 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. So if I have n layers, the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds one more 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times the 1+3(...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression, each opening parenthesis after the initial 3 corresponds to a new layer.

Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of it as a chain: each time you have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the number of times you do that is 8 times, starting from 1+3.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of times 3 is multiplied by something, it's 8 times. So perhaps the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...), so there are 8 layers of 3*(...) starting from 1+3.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as starting from 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So how many layers are there?\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So the total would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer), so:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, when I look back at the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...), but the outermost is 3*(...), so total layers are 9, with the last layer being 1+3*(Layer 8), and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, I had 9 layers, with Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure that the number of layers is correct. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo starting from the first 3(, then each ( after that is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ... (1+3(...\n3. ... (1+3(...\n4. ... (1+3(...\n5. ... (1+3(...\n6. ... (1+3(...\n7. ... (1+3(...\n8. ... (1+3(...\n9. ... (1+3(...\n10. ... (1+3))...\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers of 1+3(...). So Layer 1: innermost 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen the outermost 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of opening parentheses, it's 9, so 9 layers, leading to Layer9=29524, then multiplied by 3.\n\nBut let me check the original expression again to make sure.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So the number of layers is indeed 9, because after the initial 3, there are 8 more layers of 1+3*(...), making a total of 9 layers, with the innermost being 1+3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I had 9 layers, leading to Layer9=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me verify this with a different approach. Maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nSo, for n=1, a1=4\n\nn=2, a2=1 + 3*4=13\n\nn=3, a3=1 +3*13=40\n\nn=4, a4=1 +3*40=121\n\nn=5, a5=1 +3*121=364\n\nn=6, a6=1 +3*364=1093\n\nn=7, a7=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nn=8, a8=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nn=9, a9=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nPlugging into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nThus, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire expression as a geometric series.\n\nWait, each layer is a_n=1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as:\n\na_n=1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2})=1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this, we get a_n=1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0\n\nBut in our case, a1=4, which is 1 + 3*1, so a0 would be 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the recursive formula and the closed-form solution I have.\n\nThus, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down step by step and recognizing the pattern, we find that each layer follows a recursive formula. Using this, we compute each layer up to the ninth, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). Starting from the innermost term, we compute each layer step by step.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The outermost layer is multiplied by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Each time, there's another 3(1+3(...)). Let me count: the first 3(1+3(...)) is the outermost, then inside that, another 3(1+3(...)), and so on. Let me see, maybe I can write this as multiple layers.

Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer. So, there are 9 layers, meaning Layer 1 to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, I need to compute Layer 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 and moving outward. Let me try that.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let me break this down. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, in case I made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the expression. It's a recursive expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the recurrence relation, which confirms the result.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and working from the innermost layer outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1}\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2}\\)\n- And so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nCalculating each layer step by step:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, let's say:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, because I count nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count again. The problem is written as 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine 3s outside. Hmm, maybe I should check how many layers there are. Let me see: each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3.

Because each layer seems to be following a pattern, maybe I can find a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nWait, let me think. Each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A \u2192 9/2 = 3A \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: starting from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine 3s. Wait, let me count the number of 3s outside. Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nWait, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1+3), then Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1), and so on. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, because each time we add another layer, so from 1 to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had Layer 1 as (1+3)=4, then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*4=13, up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nBut according to the formula I just derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to miscount the layers. So, in the original problem, how many layers are there? Each time we have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...), so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer 1: (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost layer is Layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the formula again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The formula was a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 1, n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: (3^4 -1)/2 =81 -1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 =59049 -1=59048/2=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I can't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out with the initial layers, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward, recognizing the recurrence relation, and applying the derived formula to find the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Define Layers**: Starting from the innermost parenthesis:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2} = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Continue this process up to Layer 9.\n\n3. **Recognize Recurrence Relation**: Each layer \\(a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\).\n\n4. **Find Closed-Form Formula**: The solution to the recurrence is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Compute Layer 9**: Using the formula, \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\\).\n\n6. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me try to parse this.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So that innermost part is 4. Then, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So the next level is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so that level becomes 13.\n\nNow, moving out another level, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So that would be 1 + 3*(13). Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So that level is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next level would be 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So that's 121.\n\nNext, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So that's 364.\n\nContinuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*(364). Calculating: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Hmm, that's a big number, 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Wow, okay, that's growing quickly.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me see: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Wow, that's getting even bigger.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Calculating that: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That's a pretty large number now.\n\nContinuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573.\n\nWait a minute, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check how many times the expression is nested. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, so that means 9 layers. Wait, but when I started computing from the inside, I only went through 9 steps, so maybe I've done that correctly.\n\nWait, let me recount. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time I see a 1+3(...), that's a layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...): starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3 around it. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see: from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...) until we reach the outermost 3(...). So, perhaps it's 9 layers. Wait, no, let me count the number of times I have 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems like 10 layers. Let me check the original expression again. It starts with 3*(1+3*(...)), and each time, there's a 1+3*(...). So, perhaps the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. From the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) \u2192 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) \u2192 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) \u2192 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) \u2192 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) \u2192 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) \u2192 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) \u2192 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) \u2192 29524\n10. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) \u2192 88572\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with how many layers? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) within the expression. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time, we have a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Each 1+3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, which contains another 1+3, except for the innermost one which is just 1+3. So, how many times does 1+3( occur? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 instances of \"1+3(\", each starting a new layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, that would be 9 layers of 1+3(...) and then the outermost 3(...). So, perhaps I have 9 layers inside the outermost 3(...).\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I ended up with 10 layers, including the outermost 3(...). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me try again. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, let's count the number of 1+3*(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(...)\n3. 1+3*(...)\n4. 1+3*(...)\n5. 1+3*(...)\n6. 1+3*(...)\n7. 1+3*(...)\n8. 1+3*(...)\n9. 1+3*(...)\n10. 1+3*(...)\n\nWait, that's 9 instances of 1+3*(...), each nested inside the previous one, and then the outermost 3*(...). So, perhaps I have 9 layers of 1+3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So, that would make 10 layers in total.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I ended up with 3*(29524) = 88572, which would be the 10th layer, perhaps. Let me check the steps again:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I have 9 layers or 10. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, each 1+3*(... is a layer, and there are 9 of them, each starting after the previous one. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...), so 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, when I compute from the inside, I compute 9 layers, each time substituting the inner value into the next outer one, and then the outermost 3*(...) is the 10th step. So, the final result is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Outermost: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, each step seems correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about it. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*previous_value. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on.\n\nSo, the general formula would be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1 \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc., we have a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's check that for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the closed-form formula works.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see, the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3*(... is a layer, and there are 9 such layers before the outermost 3*(...). So, the innermost is a_1 = 4, then a_2 =13, up to a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute a_9: (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier as the 9th layer. Then, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form, the outermost layer would be 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} is 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the step-by-step computation is correct, and the closed-form formula confirms the result. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by expanding the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous result}\\), leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses**: Start with \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n\n3. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n\n4. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n\n5. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n\n6. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n\n7. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n\n8. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n\n9. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\n10. **Outermost Layer**: Multiply the result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to parse it.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: 1+3. That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So that layer is 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So now we're at 40.\n\nNext layer out, it's 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that. 3 times 40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nGoing another layer out, it's 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3 times 121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, that's 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me do 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. That's 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check how many layers I have here. The original expression has multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep I need to go. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times I see a 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times I have 1+3(...). Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n10. 3 times that.\n\nWait, so perhaps I went too far? Because in the original expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, maybe the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nWait, let me write the expression with each layer:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside, plus the outermost 3 times that.\n\nSo, I think I computed up to Layer 9, which gave me 88573, and then the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3*88573.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to 88573 and thought that was the final answer, but actually, that's just the inner part. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that. So, I need to compute 3*88573.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, that is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, with Layer 9 being 88573, and then the total expression is 3*Layer 9.\n\nSo, 3*88573. Let me compute that.\n\nCompute 88573 * 3.\n\nFirst, 80000*3 = 240000\n\nThen, 8000*3 = 24000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n70*3 = 210\n\n3*3 = 9\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nSo, 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 265719.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my computations because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic with such large numbers.\n\nLet me compute 88573 * 3 step by step.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n\n3*5 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n3*8 = 24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n3*8 = 24, plus 2 is 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\nBut wait, 88573 is a 5-digit number. Let me write it as:\n\n8 8 5 7 3\n\nMultiply each digit by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3*3 = 9\n\n3*7 = 21, write 1, carry 2.\n\n3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carry 1.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carry 2.\n\n3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carry 2.\n\nBut since we're at the leftmost digit, we write 26 as 2 and 6, so the carryover 2 becomes the next digit.\n\nSo, putting it together: 2 6 5 7 1 9\n\nWait, that would be 265719.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 88573 * 3 = 265,719.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 265,719.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier in computing the layers, let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on a second. Earlier, I thought Layer 9 was 88573, but now when I recount, Layer 9 is 29524. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, no. Let me recount the layers:\n\nOriginal expression: 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, if Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, Layer 3 is 40, Layer 4 is 121, Layer 5 is 364, Layer 6 is 1093, Layer 7 is 3280, Layer 8 is 9841, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so earlier when I computed up to Layer 9, I thought it was 88573, but that's incorrect. It's actually 29524.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nLet me see. When I first started, I thought the innermost was Layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nSo, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nWait, but that can't be because 29524 * 3 is 88572, but when I compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, so 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that Layer 9 was 88573, but that was a miscalculation. Actually, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 88572.\n\nWait, so I think I confused myself earlier by miscalculating the layers. So, to clarify:\n\nTotal layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check each layer to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, yes, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think earlier I made a mistake by miscalculating the number of layers or the multiplication step. But by carefully going through each layer and verifying each computation, I can be confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed step by step, and the final result is obtained by multiplying the innermost result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\).\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\).\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\).\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\).\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\).\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\).\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\).\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   - Compute \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\).\n\n10. **Final Expression:**\n    - Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me try to parse this from the inside out. So starting from the innermost part, which is 1+3, and then moving outward. Maybe if I compute each layer one by one, it'll become clearer. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1+3). So that's 1 + 3, which equals 4. Let me write that down: (1+3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next parentheses is (1+3(...)), where the ... is the result from the first step, which is 4. So the next layer is (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So that layer becomes 13. Let me note that: (1 + 3*(1+3)) = 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). The previous result was 13, so this would be (1 + 3*13). Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So that layer is 40. So, (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 40.\n\nNext layer out: (1 + 3*(40)). So 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So that's 121. So, (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 121.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*121). Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) = 364.\n\nNext, moving out another layer: (1 + 3*364). Calculating that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) ) = 1093.\n\nContinuing further out: (1 + 3*1093). Let me compute 3*1093 first. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so adding those together, 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) ) = 3280.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so adding them together gives 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) ) = 9841.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer: (1 + 3*9841). Let's calculate 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) )) ) = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. Then another, up to nine times.\n\nWait, when I was computing, I did eight layers beyond the initial one, which would make nine in total, right? Let me recount the steps to make sure I didn't skip any.\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. Then, 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, that's ten steps, but the original expression has nine layers. Let me check the original expression again. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, the number of layers is eight 3's inside, making nine parentheses? Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each (1+3(...)) is a layer, so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's the first layer, and each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, let's count how many times we have (1+3(...)):\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are eight (1+3) expressions, each nested inside the next. So, the innermost is (1+3), then (1+3*(1+3)), then (1+3*(1+3*(1+3))), and so on, up to eight layers, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, so if I have eight layers, each time adding another (1+3*...), then the total number of computations would be eight, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nWait, that's nine layers, so the outermost is (1 + 3*9841) = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so maybe the original expression has nine layers of (1+3(...)), each nested inside the next, and then multiplied by 3. So, the initial step is (1+3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another, up to layer 9, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but the original expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of (1+3) inside:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each (1+3) is inside another (1+3(...)). So, the innermost is (1+3), then the next is (1+3*(1+3)), which is two layers, then the next is (1+3*(1+3*(1+3))), which is three layers, and so on.\n\nIn the original expression, how many times does (1+3) appear? Let me count the opening parentheses:\n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3). So, from the innermost, we have:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3*(1+3))\n3. (1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n...\nUp to 8 layers, because the innermost is 1, then each layer adds one more, so total layers inside would be 8, and then the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to approach this by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form (1 + 3*previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on.\n\nSo, let's try to compute each a_n step by step.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a layer, and each subsequent layer wraps another (1+3*...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another until we have eight layers inside the outermost (1+3*...), and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is eight, because starting from the innermost, each time we add another layer, so the count is:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: (1+3*(1+3))\n\nLayer 3: (1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 8: (1+3*(... eight times ...))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer8.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had a_1 through a_9, which would suggest nine layers. So, perhaps the confusion is in whether the innermost is layer 1 or the outermost is layer 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index from the innermost as layer 1.\n\nSo, if the innermost is (1+3) = 4, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is (1 + 3*previous layer).\n\nSo, layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that would be nine layers, each computed step by step, leading to the final result of 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3A\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost before multiplying by 3, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since in this problem n=9, it's manageable either way.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the formula is correct. For n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\nUsing the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2=13. Using formula: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of (1 + 3(...)). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives a value of 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute each nested layer from the innermost:\n   - (1+3) = 4\n   - (1 + 3*4) = 13\n   - (1 + 3*13) = 40\n   - (1 + 3*40) = 121\n   - (1 + 3*121) = 364\n   - (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n   - (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n   - (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n   - (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\n2. Multiply the outermost result by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. Let me write it down more clearly. Starting from the innermost part: the innermost expression is (1+3). Then, each layer adds another 3 times that expression plus 1. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. Compute the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from the previous step). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again because 3*29524 might be better calculated as 29524*3. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nFirst, 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\n9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2.\n2*3=6, plus 2 is 8.\nSo, it's 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm each step because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each step again more carefully.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, total 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, total 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, total 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524. As before, that's 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, so each step seems to be correct. So, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), each 3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied.\n\nWait, the structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Wait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3*(result from 1)\n3. 1+3*(result from 2)\n...\nUp to 9 layers because the innermost is the first, and then each 3*(...) adds another layer. Wait, in my earlier steps, I went up to 9 layers, so 9 steps from the innermost to the outermost. So, I think I accounted for all layers correctly.\n\nWait, but when I computed, I had 10 steps, but perhaps I miscounted. Let me check:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4 (Layer 1)\n2. Next: 1+3*4=13 (Layer 2)\n3. Next: 1+3*13=40 (Layer 3)\n4. Next: 1+3*40=121 (Layer 4)\n5. Next: 1+3*121=364 (Layer 5)\n6. Next: 1+3*364=1093 (Layer 6)\n7. Next: 1+3*1093=3280 (Layer 7)\n8. Next: 1+3*3280=9841 (Layer 8)\n9. Next: 1+3*9841=29524 (Layer 9)\n10. Finally: 3*29524=88572 (Layer 10)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 layers of (1+3*...) and then the outermost 3*(...). So, 10 steps in total. But when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) adds a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)):\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) : first layer\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...)): second layer\n...\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3). So, how many layers is that? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, starting from the innermost as layer 1, each subsequent layer adds one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 opening parentheses, so that would be 9 layers inside. Then, the outermost 3*(...) is the 10th step. Hmm, perhaps I overcounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the innermost is layer 1, and each time we add a layer, so with 9 layers, we have 9 steps, and then the outermost 3*(result). So, maybe my earlier count was correct with 9 layers inside, and then the 10th step is multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me try to represent this as a recursive expression. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the total expression would be 3*a_9, since there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm each a_n step again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13. 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40=120. 1 + 120=121. Correct.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 360+3=363. 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192. 900+192=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n8*3=24, plus 1=25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n\n9*3=27, plus 2=29, write down 9, carry over 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 2.\n\nSo, 9841*3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually is manageable.\n\nWait, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's find A and B.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method using the recurrence relation confirms the result as well. So, I'm definitely confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've considered this problem from multiple angles: step-by-step computation, using a recursive formula, and even trying to find a closed-form expression. All approaches lead to the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost part:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to parse it. The innermost part is (1+3), right? So starting from the inside, let's compute that first.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's straightforward, 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times that result, so 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12. Then, we add 1 to that, so 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level out becomes 13. \n\nWait, let me write this down to keep track. Maybe it's better if I number each level. Let's see, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(Level 1) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 3*(Level 2) + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. Wait, maybe I miscounted the levels. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many levels there are. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many times does the pattern (1+3(...)) occur? Let me count the number of '1+3's.\n\nWait, actually, each time there's a (1+3(...)), so let me count the number of such instances. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1+3(...)), so let me count how many times that occurs.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each level adds another layer of 3*(...). Let me try to compute each level step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's 4. Let's denote each level as L1, L2, up to L9, maybe? Because looking at the original expression, I can see that there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so perhaps 9 levels. Let me confirm that.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1+3(...)), so let's count them:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nUp to 9 levels. So, maybe it's 9 levels deep. So, perhaps I can compute each level from L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nL2: 3*(L1) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n\nL3: 3*(L2) + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40\n\nL4: 3*(L3) + 1 = 3*40 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\n\nWait, that seems too big.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original expression is 3*(L9). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but that seems way too big. Let me check again, because I might have made a mistake in the number of levels.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of levels. Let me check how many times the (1+3(...)) occurs.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3(...)) is one level. Let's count the number of times we have (1+3(...)).\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 levels. So, yes, 9 levels. So, L1 to L9, each being 3*(previous level) +1.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to L9, I got 29524, then the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. But that seems very large. Let me verify this with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value at level n, where a_1 = 4, as computed before. Then, a_{n} = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, for n >=2.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in the expression, each level is 3*(inner expression) +1, so yes, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial condition again. The innermost expression is (1 + 3) = 4, which is a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*a_1 +1 = 3*4 +1 =13\n\na_3 = 3*13 +1 =40\n\na_4 =3*40 +1=121\n\na_5=3*121 +1=364\n\na_6=3*364 +1=1093\n\na_7=3*1093 +1=3280\n\na_8=3*3280 +1=9841\n\na_9=3*9841 +1=29524\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, since the original problem is 3*(1+3(...)) which is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because 88572 seems quite a large number. Maybe I made a mistake in the recurrence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using a formula for the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nI know that for such linear recurrences, the solution can be found using the method for non-homogeneous linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} -1)/(k -1). Wait, but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, so k=3, c=1.\n\nBut wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, so perhaps we can adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nWait, the standard formula for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} -1)/(k -1). But here, our initial condition is a_1=4, so a_0 would be when n=0, but in our case, n starts at 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I can adjust the formula to fit our indexing. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute a few terms to see if the pattern holds.\n\nWait, let me compute a_1 through a_9 again to check for any possible errors.\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*a_1 +1 = 3*4 +1 =13\n\na_3 =3*13 +1=40\n\na_4=3*40 +1=121\n\na_5=3*121 +1=364\n\na_6=3*364 +1=1093\n\na_7=3*1093 +1=3280\n\na_8=3*3280 +1=9841\n\na_9=3*9841 +1=29524\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, 3*a_9 would be 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a different approach to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n =3*a_{n-1} +1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies a_n =3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A =3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this once more because 88572 seems quite large, and I might have miscounted the levels.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, how many times does the (1+3) occur? Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 levels because each time we have an opening parenthesis, and the innermost is (1+3), then each level adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think that each \"1+3\" is a separate level, so starting from the innermost, we have:\n\nLevel 1: (1+3) =4\n\nLevel 2: 3*(Level1)+1=13\n\nLevel3:3*13+1=40\n\nLevel4:3*40+1=121\n\nLevel5:3*121+1=364\n\nLevel6:3*364+1=1093\n\nLevel7:3*1093+1=3280\n\nLevel8:3*3280+1=9841\n\nLevel9:3*9841+1=29524\n\nSo, 9 levels in total, so the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula I derived: a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_9=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can compute this using a different approach, like expanding the expression step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) and compute it step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3)=4.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have 3*(previous result) +1.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\nStart with 4.\n\nThen, 3*4 +1=13.\n\nThen, 3*13 +1=40.\n\nThen, 3*40 +1=121.\n\nThen, 3*121 +1=364.\n\nThen, 3*364 +1=1093.\n\nThen, 3*1093 +1=3280.\n\nThen, 3*3280 +1=9841.\n\nThen, 3*9841 +1=29524.\n\nThen, finally, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each step using a table:\n\nLevel | Expression | Value\n-----|------------|------\n1    | (1+3)      | 4\n2    | 3*4 +1     |13\n3    | 3*13 +1    |40\n4    | 3*40 +1    |121\n5    | 3*121 +1   |364\n6    | 3*364 +1   |1093\n7    | 3*1093 +1  |3280\n8    | 3*3280 +1  |9841\n9    | 3*9841 +1  |29524\n10   | 3*29524    |88572\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so that's level 10, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I miscounted the levels because the original expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), so the innermost is level 1, and the outermost is level 10.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I had 9 levels, but perhaps it's 10. Let me check.\n\nWait, when I count the number of times we have (1+3(...)), it's 9 times. So, perhaps the levels are 1 through 9, and then the outermost 3* is level 10.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the innermost being level 1, and each subsequent layer adds a level, so with 9 layers, the outermost is level 9, and then the final multiplication by 3 is level 10.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the expression is 3*(...), so that's one more layer beyond the 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, so perhaps the total number of layers is 10: 9 layers of (1+3(...)) and then the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I had a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572, which would be level 10.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as 9 layers inside the 3*, so the 3* is level 10.\n\nWait, but in any case, the result seems to be 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I can verify this with a different approach, using the formula for the sum.\n\nWait, the expression can be seen as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 levels of 1+3*.\n\nWait, so perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times.\n\nWait, but maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a geometric series.\n\nWait, from the recurrence relation, we have a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThen, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524, then times 3 is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check this using a calculator for each step to ensure there are no arithmetic errors.\n\nCompute a_1: 1+3=4\n\na_2:3*4=12; 12+1=13\n\na_3:3*13=39; 39+1=40\n\na_4:3*40=120;120+1=121\n\na_5:3*121=363;363+1=364\n\na_6:3*364=1092;1092+1=1093\n\na_7:3*1093=3279;3279+1=3280\n\na_8:3*3280=9840;9840+1=9841\n\na_9:3*9841=29523;29523+1=29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 3*29524 step by step:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I can also check using another method, like breaking down 29524 into parts.\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4.\n\nSo, 3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*20=60\n\n3*4=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +60=88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after all these checks, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute the expression step by step, writing down each level's value:\n\nLevel 1: 4\n\nLevel 2: 13\n\nLevel 3:40\n\nLevel4:121\n\nLevel5:364\n\nLevel6:1093\n\nLevel7:3280\n\nLevel8:9841\n\nLevel9:29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) and compute each step.\n\nLet me try to compute each step:\n\nStart with the innermost (1+3)=4.\n\nThen, moving out, each step is 3*(previous result) +1.\n\nSo:\n\nStep 1: 1+3=4\n\nStep 2: 3*4 +1=13\n\nStep3:3*13 +1=40\n\nStep4:3*40 +1=121\n\nStep5:3*121 +1=364\n\nStep6:3*364 +1=1093\n\nStep7:3*1093 +1=3280\n\nStep8:3*3280 +1=9841\n\nStep9:3*9841 +1=29524\n\nStep10:3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I can also compute this using a different approach, such as recognizing that each level is a geometric progression.\n\nWait, from the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we derived earlier.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I can also compute 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThen, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nThen, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've checked this in multiple ways, and all approaches lead to the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by simplifying from the innermost parentheses and work our way out step by step.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Level:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Level:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 13 + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Level:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 40 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Level:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 121 + 1 = 363 + 1 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Level:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 364 + 1 = 1092 + 1 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Level:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 1093 + 1 = 3279 + 1 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Level:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 3280 + 1 = 9840 + 1 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Level:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 9841 + 1 = 29523 + 1 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost Expression:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me try to write down the expression step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nSo, the innermost part is $1+3$. Let me compute that first. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, replacing that part, the next layer out is $1 + 3(4)$. Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have $1 + 3(13)$. Let me compute that. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer is 40.\n\nNext layer out is $1 + 3(40)$. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. That's the next value.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have $1 + 3(121)$. Let me calculate that: 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. So, that's 364.\n\nNext, the layer is $1 + 3(364)$. 3*364 is... hmm, let me compute that. 360*3 is 1080, and 4*3 is 12, so 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have $1 + 3(1093)$. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nNext layer out is $1 + 3(3280)$. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240, and 0*3 is 0. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. That's 9841.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have $1 + 3(9841)$. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nNext, the layer is $1 + 3(29524)$. Let me calculate 3*29524. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is $3(88573)$. Let me compute that. 3*88573. Hmm, 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if I did that last multiplication correctly. 88573 times 3. Let me do it another way to verify. 88573 * 3: 3*3 is 9, 3*7 is 21, 3*5 is 15, 3*8 is 24, 3*8 is 24. So, writing it down:\n\n3 * 88573\n= 3 * (80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3)\n= 240000 + 24000 + 1500 + 210 + 9\n= 240000 + 24000 = 264000\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 265719. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally: 3*88573 = 265719\n\nThat seems correct. Each step, I computed the innermost parentheses first, then moved outward, each time replacing the innermost part with its computed value. So, each layer is built upon the previous one, and by the time I get to the outermost layer, I just multiply by 3. I think that's the right approach because the expression is a series of nested parentheses, and to solve such expressions, you always start from the innermost part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this computation without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that for a second. The expression seems to be a repeated pattern of 1 + 3*(something). So, perhaps it's a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me define each step as a term in a sequence. Let's say a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This seems like a linear recurrence relation.\n\nIf I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, then I can compute the nth term without having to calculate each step. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The general form of a linear recurrence relation is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c and d are constants. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is given by a_n = A*c^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the values. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence relation:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtracting A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\nB - 3B = 1\n-2B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n9/2 = 3A\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n=1, a1 should be 4.\n\nPlugging n=1 into the formula: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works. Therefore, each term a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, how many layers are there in the original problem? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" before the first closing parenthesis. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. Let me count the number of layers. Each time we add a layer, it's another multiplication by 3. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so counting from the innermost, each time we add a layer, it's one more. So, the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, n=9.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I started, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, the total number of layers is 9.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step computation earlier, I had a9 = 29524, which matches. Then, the next step was a10 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, and then finally 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's 29524, which is correct. Then, the next layer would be a10 = 1 + 3*a9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, which is correct, and then the outermost is 3*a10 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute a9 = 29524, then a10 = 88573, then multiply by 3 to get 265719. So, that's another way to compute it without having to go through each step manually.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me verify if a10 is indeed 88573 using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a10 = (3^{11} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 59049*3 = 177147.\n\nThus, a10 = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a10 = 3*88573 = 265719. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same result: 265719.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap:\n\n- The problem is a nested expression with 9 layers of 1+3(...).\n- Each layer can be computed by starting from the innermost and working outward.\n- Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows us to find a closed-form formula, which can compute the result more efficiently.\n- Both methods lead to the same final answer.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 265719 is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{265719}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each term as a sequence \\( a_n \\) where each term is given by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). The closed-form solution for this recurrence relation is:\n\n\\[ a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nWe need to compute the value for \\( n = 9 \\) and then proceed outward:\n\n1. Compute \\( a_9 \\):\n   \\[ a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\n2. Compute the next term \\( a_{10} \\):\n   \\[ a_{10} = 1 + 3a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 88573 \\]\n\n3. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n   \\[ 3 \\times a_{10} = 3 \\times 88573 = 265719 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{265719}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: 1+3. That should be straightforward. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 plus 3 times that result. So, moving one layer out, it would be 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to write this down more clearly.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define each innermost expression first:\n\nLet\u2019s say the innermost expression is A\u2080 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, A\u2081 = 1 + 3*A\u2080.\n\nThen A\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081, and so on, until we reach A\u2088, since there are nine layers of 1+3(...). Wait, actually, let me count how many times 1+3 is nested. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then that is inside another 1+3*(...), so each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the outermost 3, inside it is 1 + 3*(...), and inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on. Let me count the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let's see: from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each 1+3 is followed by another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the first 1+3, that's the innermost, then each subsequent one adds another layer. Let me see: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on until there are nine 1+3 terms? Wait, no, let me count the number of times 1+3 is used. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then moving out, each time we have another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then inside it is (1+3(...)), which itself contains another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count the number of (1+3(...) sections. Let's see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then that is inside another 1+3(...), and so on until we have a total of nine 1+3 terms? Wait, no, let me actually count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's see: the first 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, then 1+3, then another opening parenthesis, and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, starting from the first ( after 3, then each subsequent ( is another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's nine opening parentheses. So, that would mean there are nine layers of 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...), up to nine layers. So, to compute this, I need to start from the innermost layer and work my way outwards, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as A\u2080, A\u2081, A\u2082, ..., A\u2088, where A\u2080 is the innermost expression, and A\u2088 is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, A\u2080 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, A\u2081 = 1 + 3*A\u2080\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081\n\nAnd so on, up to A\u2088.\n\nOnce I compute A\u2088, the entire expression is 3*A\u2088.\n\nSo, let's compute each A step by step.\n\nStarting with A\u2080:\n\nA\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, A\u2081 = 1 + 3*A\u2080 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A\u2088 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me write down each step clearly:\n\nA\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nA\u2081 = 1 + 3*A\u2080 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nA\u2082 = 1 + 3*A\u2081 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nA\u2083 = 1 + 3*A\u2082 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nA\u2084 = 1 + 3*A\u2083 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nA\u2085 = 1 + 3*A\u2084 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nA\u2086 = 1 + 3*A\u2085 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nA\u2087 = 1 + 3*A\u2086 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nA\u2088 = 1 + 3*A\u2087 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A\u2088 = 3*29524\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me recompute A\u2088:\n\nA\u2087 = 9841\n\nSo, A\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a 4-digit number, so:\n\nLet me write it as 9841\n\nMultiply by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2\n\nBut there's no more digits, so we write down the 2 as well, making it 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841=29523\n\nThen, A\u2088=1 + 29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*A\u2088=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each step manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, with A\u2080=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for A\u2099.\n\nThe recurrence is A\u2099 = 1 + 3*A\u2099\u208b\u2081, with A\u2080=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is A\u2099 = C*3\u207f + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find D. If A\u2099 = D, then D = 1 + 3*D.\n\nSolving for D: D = 1 + 3D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is A\u2099 = C*3\u207f - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition A\u2080=4:\n\nA\u2080 = C*3\u2070 - 1/2 = C*1 - 1/2 = C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is A\u2099 = (9/2)*3\u207f - 1/2\n\nSimplify this:\n\nA\u2099 = (9/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (9*3\u207f - 1)/2\n\nSo, A\u2099 = (9*3\u207f - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have A\u2088, let's compute A\u2088 using this formula.\n\nA\u2088 = (9*3\u2078 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3\u2078:\n\n3\u00b9=3\n\n3\u00b2=9\n\n3\u00b3=27\n\n3\u2074=81\n\n3\u2075=243\n\n3\u2076=729\n\n3\u2077=2187\n\n3\u2078=6561\n\nSo, 3\u2078=6561\n\nThus, A\u2088 = (9*6561 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 9*6561:\n\n9*6000=54000\n\n9*500=4500\n\n9*60=540\n\n9*1=9\n\nWait, that's 54000 + 4500 + 540 + 9 = 54000 + 4500 = 58500 + 540 = 59040 + 9 = 59049\n\nSo, 9*6561=59049\n\nThen, 59049 - 1 = 59048\n\nSo, A\u2088 = 59048 / 2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier calculation. So, A\u2088=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A\u2088=3*29524=88572\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponents or multiplications.\n\nWait, 3\u2078 is indeed 6561, because 3\u2077=2187, so 2187*3=6561.\n\nThen, 9*6561: Let me compute 6561*9.\n\nCompute 6561*9:\n\n1*9=9\n\n6*9=54\n\n5*9=45\n\n6*9=54\n\nWait, but 6561 is 6,5,6,1.\n\nSo, 1*9=9\n\n6*9=54, write down 4, carry over 5\n\n5*9=45 +5=50, write down 0, carry over 5\n\n6*9=54 +5=59, write down 9, carry over 5\n\nBut wait, that's 6561*9:\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*9=9\n\n6*9=54, write down 4, carry over 5\n\n5*9=45 +5=50, write down 0, carry over 5\n\n6*9=54 +5=59, write down 9, carry over 5\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write down the 5, making it 59049.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 9*6561=59049.\n\nThen, 59049 -1=59048\n\nDivide by 2: 59048/2=29524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, A\u2088=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each A\u2099 step by step again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with A\u2080=4\n\nA\u2081=1 + 3*4=1+12=13\n\nA\u2082=1 + 3*13=1+39=40\n\nA\u2083=1 + 3*40=1+120=121\n\nA\u2084=1 + 3*121=1+363=364\n\nA\u2085=1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nA\u2086=1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nA\u2087=1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nA\u2088=1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression involving multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By breaking it down from the innermost layer and working outward, each step can be computed sequentially. Using a recurrence relation approach, we find that the expression simplifies to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first, which is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Calculating 3*40 gives 120, and adding 1 gives 121. So, now we're at 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, this layer is 364.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Breaking it down, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, this layer is 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let's do 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, and 3*3 = 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280.

Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, this layer is 9841.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, and 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, this layer is 29524.\n\nWait, hold on.

So, writing it out:\n\n9841\n\u00d7   3\n------\n29523\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 1 + 29523 is indeed 29524.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, this layer is 88573.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me verify. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573. Let's break it down: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. So, this layer is 265720.\n\nWait, let me verify 88573 * 3. 88573 * 3: 3*3=9, 3*7=21, 3*5=15, 3*8=24, 3*8=24. So, writing it out:\n\n88573\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n265719\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, adding 1 gives 265720.\n\nSo, now, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 265720. But wait, the original problem is 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 265720.\n\nCalculating that: 265720 * 3. Let's break it down: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60, 0*3=0. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3 * 265720 = 797160.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again. 265720 * 3:\n\n200000 * 3 = 600000\n60000 * 3 = 180000\n5000 * 3 = 15000\n700 * 3 = 2100\n20 * 3 = 60\n0 * 3 = 0\n\nAdding them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000; 780000 + 15000 = 795000; 795000 + 2100 = 797100; 797100 + 60 = 797160. So, yes, 797160 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the entire expression is 797160.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recount the number of layers. Starting from the innermost (1+3), that's the first layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous result) +1. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of times we have 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3*(result))\n3. Then: (1+3*(result))\n4. And so on.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 is used.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Wait, let me count:\n\nEach time you have a 1+3(...), that's a layer. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many 1+3(...) are there? Let's count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is 3 followed by (1+3(...)), which has 9 opening parentheses. So, that means there are 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, we compute 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, after computing all 9 layers, we multiply by 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went through 9 layers, each time computing a new value, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. So, maybe I did it correctly.\n\nWait, but when I computed each layer, I ended up with 265720 as the result inside the outermost parentheses, and then multiplied by 3 to get 797160.\n\nBut let me verify this again step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to 265720, which seems like more than 9 layers. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(...). Let's count the number of 1+3*(...):\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Next layer is (1+3*(1+3))\n3. Then (1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n...\nWait, but in the original expression, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside the main expression.\n\nThe main expression is 3*(...). Inside, it's 1 + 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until we have 9 layers of 1+3*(...). So, that means we have 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\n1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3 * 29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute this carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\nNow, since there are no more digits, write down the carry over 2.\n\nWait, that would give us 27524? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, let's write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0.\n9 * 3 = 27, write 7, carry 2.\nNow, there are no more digits, so write the carry 2.\n\nSo, the result is 27524 + 20000? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I should write it as 27524 + 20000? Wait, no, that's not how multiplication works.\n\nWait, perhaps I should do it more carefully:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n- Ten-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- Since there are no more digits, write down the carryover 2.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 2 (from units), 7 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 7 (thousands), 7 (ten-thousands), and then the carryover 2 (hundred-thousands place). So, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 265720, but that was when I had more layers. Wait, no, I think I confused myself.\n\nWait, no, if after 9 layers, the innermost expression is 29524, then 3 * 29524 is 88572. So, that's the final result.\n\nWait, but in my earlier detailed calculation, I went through 9 layers and ended up with 265720, which was after 11 layers or something. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let's clarify: The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's the first layer. Each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3*(...) expressions.\n\nLet me write the expression out:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of such layers.\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 1 layer\n2. (1 + 3*(1+3)) \u2192 2 layers\n3. (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3))) \u2192 3 layers\n...\nContinuing until we have 9 layers because each time we add another 1+3*(...).\n\nWait, so the innermost is layer 1: (1+3) = 4.\n\nThen layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 * 29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation where I ended up with 797160. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears inside the main expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let's count:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 2\n3. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 3\n...\nUp to layer 9.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we get 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought I had 9 layers but ended up with 265720, which was after more layers. So, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me check the expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. After the first 3(, that's layer 1: (1+3)\n2. Then, inside that, another (1+3(...)), which is layer 2\n3. And so on, until we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, but the way the expression is written, each 1+3(...) is nested inside the previous one. So, the total number of layers is 9, starting from (1+3) up to the 9th layer.\n\nTherefore, after 9 layers, we get 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, so my initial calculation was incorrect because I thought there were more layers. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify this again step by step.\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 9 layers and ended up with 265720, which was incorrect because I must have miscounted the layers. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry over 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry over 0\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry over 2\nNow, since there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, the result is 27524 + 20000? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, the way it's written, it's 27524 + 20000? Wait, no, that's not how it works. Let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- Thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- Ten-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n- Since there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, the result is 2 (from the carryover) followed by 7, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, that would be 27572? That can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the digit positions. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n- Units digit: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n- Tens digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n- Hundreds digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n- Thousands digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n- Ten-thousands digit: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n- Since there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, the result is 27572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is definitely more than that. Wait, perhaps I missed a digit.\n\nWait, let me write it as:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n= 88572\n\nYes, because 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\nThen, the carryover 2 is placed before the 7, making it 27572? Wait, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\nNow, since there are no more digits, write the carryover 2 before the 7, making it 27.\n\nWait, that would make the number 27572, but that's not correct because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the digit alignment.\n\nWait, let's compute it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nCompute each digit:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1\n- Thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0\n- Ten-thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2\n- Now, since there are no more digits, the carryover 2 is added to the left.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n2 (carryover) 7 (from ten-thousands) 7 (from thousands) 5 (from hundreds) 7 (from tens) 2 (from units)\n\nWait, that would be 27572, which is incorrect. Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm misaligning the digits.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply 29524 by 3, the correct result is 88572. So, perhaps I should compute it differently.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n- 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0\n- 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2\n- Now, since there are no more digits, write the carryover 2.\n\nSo, the digits are: 2 (from carryover), 7 (from 9*3), 7 (from 2*3), 5 (from 5*3), 7 (from 2*3), 2 (from 4*3).\n\nWait, that would give 27572, but that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the order.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to compute it as:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought I had more layers, leading me to an incorrect result. After carefully recounting the layers and ensuring that there are only 9 layers, the correct result is 88572.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Compute innermost (1+3) = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9.

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That might be the way to go because each layer depends on the one inside it. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So that part is straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, the next part is 1 plus 3 times that result. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. So the next layer out is 13. \n\nMoving out another layer, it's again 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So that's 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, and then 1 plus 39 is 40. So now I have 40 as the result for that layer.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let's see, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So that's 121. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. \n\nThen, the next one is 1 + 3*(364). Calculating that: 3 times 364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. \n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(1,093). Let's compute that. 3 times 1,093 is 3,279, plus 1 is 3,280. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3,280). 3 times 3,280 is 9,840, plus 1 is 9,841. \n\nAnother layer out: 1 + 3*(9,841). Calculating that, 3 times 9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. \n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(29,524). Let's see, 3 times 29,524 is 88,572, plus 1 is 88,573. \n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(88,573). Computing that: 3 times 88,573 is 265,719, plus 1 is 265,720. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). Each time, I think I've been moving out one layer, but maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3) which is 4. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous result) + 1. So how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 3. Hmm, maybe it's better to count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and there are 9 such layers because each one is enclosed in parentheses and each starts with 1+3. So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and working outwards. Wait, no, actually, each time I move out, I'm going one layer up, so perhaps I did 9 layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted when I was computing. Let me try again, more carefully, step by step, to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me number each layer from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 through 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times the outermost layer, which is Layer 9. So the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 times 29,524: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute this:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me check again.\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 with a carryover of 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had gotten 265,719 for the outermost layer, which was wrong because I think I miscalculated the number of layers. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought the outermost layer was 1+3*(88,573). That was incorrect because I had more layers than I thought. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))).\n\nSo, how many layers of (1+3*(...)) are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" starts a new layer, so let's see:\n\nStarting with 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))).\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3*(1+3*(...))\n2. Then another 1+3*(...)\n3. So, each time we have a 1+3*(...), that's a new layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers because each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and there are 9 of them before the first 3. Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), and then the outermost 3 multiplies the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try to count the number of (1+3(...)) layers.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...) +1. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet's see: starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and I can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the number of (1+3(...) is 9, because each time we have an opening parenthesis, except the last one which is just (1+3). So, perhaps it's 9 layers. Let me confirm:\n\nEach time we have a 1+3(, that's a new layer, so:\n\n1. 3*(1+3*(...)) \u2192 layer 1\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3*(...) \u2192 layer 2\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1+3) is layer 9.\n\nSo, in total, 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me compute each layer step by step, starting from layer 1 (innermost) to layer 9 (outermost before the final 3).\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nSo, the outermost layer before the final 3 is Layer 9, which is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this Layer 9. So, 3 * 29,524.\n\nCalculating that: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572.\n\nWait, so the total value of the expression is 88,572. Hmm, but earlier when I thought I had more layers, I ended up with a much larger number, which I realized was incorrect. So, I think this is correct now.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me recount:\n\nEach time we have a \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 such layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layers 1 through 9 as I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the 9th layer, which is 29,524, giving 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3 is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier for layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. So, using the closed-form formula, I also get 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, plus 1. But in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one, it's a linear recurrence, not a simple geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as follows: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as I derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if 3^{10} is indeed 59,049.\n\nYes, because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048, divided by 2 is 29,524. Then, 29,524 * 3 is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step, just to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we can write this as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution, as I found earlier, is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. So, the answer should be 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3 is 29524. Now, we multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, when I multiply each part by 3:\n\n- 20000 *3 = 60000\n- 9000 *3 = 27000\n- 500 *3 = 1500\n- 20 *3 = 60\n- 4 *3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct because 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it another way:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n________\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Level 9. Let me go back and check each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Level 8 again because 3*3280: 3280 * 3. Let me compute that: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, Level 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that again: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524: Let me do it another way. 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n________\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without assigning levels, just to cross-verify.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nCompute the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I also get 88,572. That confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula without computing each level, but since I've already done it step by step, I think it's solid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward, resulting in the final value of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to write it down step by step, starting from the innermost part. So, the innermost part is 1+3. Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me write that down. The next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. \n\nAlright, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that, 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40. \n\nLet me see if I can spot a pattern here. The first innermost layer was 4, then 13, then 40. Hmm, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous). Maybe I can keep going step by step. The next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that's 121. \n\nContinuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate that. 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, that's 364. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me work that out. 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093. \n\nAnother layer: 1 + 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1093 is... let me compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280. \n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that's 9841. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. 3*3280: 3280 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit. 3*0 is 0, 3*8 is 24, carry over 2. 3*2 is 6 plus 2 is 8. 3*3 is 9. So, it's 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is indeed 9841. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524. \n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is indeed 29524. Okay, that's correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that's 88573. \n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. Yeah, that's correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute that. 3*88573. Hmm, 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. So, that's 265720. \n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. 3*88573: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding them: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. Correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*265720. Let me compute that. 3*265720. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding them up: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, +15000=795000, +2100=797100, +60=797160. Then, 1 + 797160 is 797161. So, that's 797161. \n\nWait, let me verify. 3*265720: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. So, 600000 + 180000 is 780000, +15000=795000, +2100=797100, +60=797160. Then, 1 + 797160 is 797161. Correct. \n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer: 3*(previous result). Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after the innermost layers, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So, the previous result was 797161, so the entire expression is 3*797161. Let me compute that. \n\n3*797161. Let me break it down: 700000*3=2100000, 90000*3=270000, 7000*3=21000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, +21000=2391000, +300=2391300, +180=2391480, +3=2391483. So, 3*797161 is 2391483. \n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication. 797161 * 3: \n\nStarting from the right:\n1*3=3\n6*3=18, carry over 1\n1*3=3 +1=4\n7*3=21, carry over 2\n9*3=27 +2=29, carry over 2\n7*3=21 +2=23, carry over 2\n9*3=27 +2=29, carry over 2\n7*3=21 +2=23, carry over 2\nFinally, 0*3=0 +2=2\n\nWait, actually, 797161 is a 6-digit number. Let me write it out:\n\n7 9 7 1 6 1\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1*3=3\n6*3=18, write down 8, carry over 1\n1*3=3 +1=4\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2\n9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2\n7*3=21 +2=23, write down 3, carry over 2\nSince there are no more digits, write down 2.\n\nWait, that gives us 2391483. Let me write it step by step:\n\n797161 * 3:\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n6 * 3 = 18, carry over 1, write 8\n1 * 3 = 3 + 1 = 4\n7 * 3 = 21, carry over 2, write 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, carry over 2, write 9\n7 * 3 = 21 + 2 = 23, carry over 2, write 3\nNo more digits, write 2.\n\nSo, the result is 2 3 9 1 4 8 3, which is 2391483. So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 2,391,483. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet's see, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. \n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Then, the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, total layers: 9 inner layers plus the outer multiplication. So, I think I did 9 layers, each time computing from the inside out, which gave me 797161, and then multiplied by 3 to get 2391483. \n\nBut let me just verify that I didn't skip any layers. Let me write down the expression with each layer labeled. \n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1+3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1+3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1+3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1+3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1+3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1+3*(Layer 8)\nFinal: 3*(Layer 9)\n\nYes, that's 9 layers inside, and then the final multiplication by 3. So, I think I did that correctly. Each time, I computed the innermost layer first and worked my way out. \n\nLet me just recap the computations to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error somewhere. \n\nLayer 1: 1+3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nWait, hold on, earlier I thought Layer 9 was 88573, but according to this, Layer 9 is 29524? Wait, no, I think I might have miscounted the layers earlier. Let me check again. \n\nWait, no, in my initial step-by-step, I had 9 layers, each time computing up to Layer 9 as 29524, then moving out another layer to compute 1 + 3*29524, which would be Layer 10, but actually, the original problem only has 9 inner layers. So, maybe I messed up the layer count. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" instances. \n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3. \n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nLet me write it out with indices:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n11. )))))))))\n\nWait, so there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\", starting from the innermost. So, that would mean 9 layers inside, each time adding another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around it. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that was actually the result before the final multiplication by 3. \n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I went beyond 9 layers, which might have been incorrect. Let me recount. \n\nWait, perhaps I overcomplicated it earlier. Let me try again, step by step, layer by layer, making sure I count correctly. \n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)\n\nSo, let's compute each layer one by one.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, not 2391483. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier computation. What's going on here? \n\nWait, I think I messed up earlier when I thought the final result was 2,391,483. That must have been a miscalculation because if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572, not 2 million something. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by miscounting the layers and applying more layers than actually exist. \n\nLet me clarify: the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(...). \n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, so there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" inside the main expression. Therefore, Layer 1 is the innermost 1+3, and Layer 9 is the outermost 1+3(...). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 is 88572. \n\nBut wait, earlier when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, I thought that was the innermost layer, but actually, that's the outermost. So, perhaps I misapplied the layers earlier. Let me see. \n\nWait, no, in my initial computation, I started from the innermost and worked outwards, correctly computing each layer step by step. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572, not 2,391,483. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by adding extra layers beyond the 9th, which weren't actually present in the original problem. \n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again. It's written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, how many \"1+3(\" are there? Let's parse it:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). \n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 \"1+3(\" instances, meaning 9 layers inside. So, Layer 1 is the innermost 1+3, and Layer 9 is the outermost 1+3(...). Therefore, the final expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. \n\nTherefore, my initial mistake was thinking that I had more layers, but actually, it's only 9 layers. So, the correct answer is 88,572. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write out the expression with each layer clearly labeled.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. \n\nI think earlier I miscounted the layers and went beyond the 9th layer, which led me to an incorrect result. So, it's important to carefully count the number of layers to avoid such mistakes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n = 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result. \n\nAlternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was working step by step, it's good to verify with a formula as well.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a recurrence relation, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. \n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have 3 times that result plus 1. Wait, let me check: the next level is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after computing (1 + 3) = 4, the next step is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\nSecond level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that.\n\nThird level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so each time I'm taking the result from the previous step, multiplying it by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if this pattern continues.\n\nFourth level: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nFifth level: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That seems right.\n\nSixth level: 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nSeventh level: 1 + 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nEighth level: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280 first. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841.\n\nNinth level: 1 + 3*9841. Okay, 3*9841. Let me break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524.\n\nTenth level: Finally, the outermost part is 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's do this step by step. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back and check each step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1092 + 1 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 again. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern here. Each step seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it.\n\nLet me denote each level as a_n, where n is the level number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\na_10 = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost operation is 3*(...), so a_10 is 3*a_9, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nUsing the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nLet me substitute the general solution into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, left-hand side: A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSet equal to RHS: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B.\n\nThen, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier results.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nn=10: a_{10} = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*a_9, which is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if I consider that the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach term inside is 1 + 3*(...), which can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nBut perhaps that's overcomplicating it. The step-by-step computation seems straightforward.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the expression has nine sets of parentheses, so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each subsequent level adds another 3*(previous) +1, so there are nine levels before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, let me count the number of (1+3(...)) terms.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent level adds another 3*(...) +1, and there are nine such levels before the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, that means the innermost is level 1, then level 2, up to level 9, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 is level 10.\n\nWait, but in my earlier approach, I had a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, up to a_9 = 29524, and then the final result is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I model it as a geometric series, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n in terms of 3^{n}.\n\nWait, as I did earlier, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which seems to hold for each n.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 177147 - 3 = 177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Evaluate the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move to the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3.

Let me compute that first. That's 1 plus 3, which is 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next step would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So that becomes 13.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So that's 40.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So now we have 121.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So that's 364.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is... let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 plus 1 is 1093. So that's 1093.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279.

Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So that's 29524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Calculating 3*29524: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 88572 plus 1 is 88573. So that's 88573.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding all together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. So that's 265720.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that calculation because 3*88573: 88573 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n88573\n*     3\n--------\n265719\n\nYes, that's correct. So adding 1 gives 265720.\n\nNow, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute 3*265720. 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding them up: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161. So that's 797161.\n\nWait, let me check that again because 3*265720: 265720 * 3. Let me compute:\n\n265720\n*     3\n--------\n797160\n\nYes, that's correct. So adding 1 gives 797161.\n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(797161). Let me compute 3*797161. 700000*3 is 2100000, 90000*3 is 270000, 7000*3 is 21000, 100*3 is 300, 60*3 is 180, 1*3 is 3. Adding these together: 2100000 + 270000 is 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. Then, adding 1 gives 2391484. So that's 2391484.\n\nWait, let me verify that: 797161 * 3. 700000*3 is 2,100,000. 97,161*3: 90,000*3 is 270,000, 7,000*3 is 21,000, 161*3 is 483. So 270,000 + 21,000 is 291,000, plus 483 is 291,483. Adding that to 2,100,000 gives 2,391,483. Then adding 1 gives 2,391,484. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(2,391,484). Let me compute 3*2,391,484. Hmm, 2,000,000*3 is 6,000,000, 391,484*3 is... let me compute that. 300,000*3 is 900,000, 91,484*3: 90,000*3 is 270,000, 1,484*3 is 4,452. So adding those: 270,000 + 4,452 is 274,452. Then, 900,000 + 274,452 is 1,174,452. Adding that to 6,000,000 gives 7,174,452. Then, adding 1 gives 7,174,453.\n\nWait, let me check that step again because I think I might have miscalculated. Let me compute 3*2,391,484 step by step.\n\n2,391,484\n*         3\n-----------\nLet's do it digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n4 * 3 = 12 + 2 = 14, write down 4, carry over 1.\n1 * 3 = 3 + 1 = 4.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n3 * 3 = 9 + 2 = 11, write down 1, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo putting it together: 7,174,452. Then adding 1 gives 7,174,453. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3*(7,174,453). Let me compute that. 7,000,000*3 is 21,000,000, 174,453*3: 100,000*3 is 300,000, 70,000*3 is 210,000, 4,000*3 is 12,000, 400*3 is 1,200, 50*3 is 150, 3*3 is 9. Adding these together: 300,000 + 210,000 is 510,000, plus 12,000 is 522,000, plus 1,200 is 523,200, plus 150 is 523,350, plus 9 is 523,359. Then, adding 21,000,000 gives 21,523,359.\n\nWait, let me check that again because 7,174,453 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n7,174,453\n*         3\n-----------\n3 * 3 = 9\n3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1.\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write down 3, carry over 1.\n3 * 7 = 21 + 1 = 22, write down 2, carry over 2.\n3 * 1 = 3 + 2 = 5.\n3 * 7 = 21.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n3 * 5 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write 3, carry 1\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write 3, carry 1\n3 * 7 = 21 + 1 = 22, write 2, carry 2\n3 * 1 = 3 + 2 = 5\n3 * 7 = 21\n\nWait, but 7,174,453 is a 7-digit number: millions, hundred thousands, ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, units.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute it step by step:\n\n7,174,453 * 3:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n3 * 5 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write 3, carry 1\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write 3, carry 1\n3 * 7 = 21 + 1 = 22, write 2, carry 2\n3 * 1 = 3 + 2 = 5\n3 * 7 = 21, write 1, carry 2\nBut wait, that's 7 digits, so the next digit is the millions place, which is 7. So 3 * 7 = 21 + carryover 2? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nWait, let me write the number correctly:\n\n7,174,453\n= 7,000,000 + 174,453\n\nSo, 7,000,000 * 3 = 21,000,000\n\n174,453 * 3: Let's compute that.\n\n174,453\n*      3\n----------\n3 * 3 = 9\n3 * 5 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write 3, carry 1\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write 3, carry 1\n3 * 7 = 21 + 1 = 22, write 2, carry 2\n3 * 1 = 3 + 2 = 5\n3 * 0 (since there's no digit beyond 1 in 174,453) = 0 + 2 = 2 (carryover from the previous digit)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute 174,453 * 3 properly.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n3 * 5 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write 3, carry 1\n3 * 4 = 12 + 1 = 13, write 3, carry 1\n3 * 7 = 21 + 1 = 22, write 2, carry 2\n3 * 1 = 3 + 2 = 5\n3 * 0 (since beyond 1, it's the next higher digit which is 0) = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nWait, so the result is 523,359.\n\nSo, 174,453 * 3 = 523,359.\n\nThen, adding to 21,000,000: 21,000,000 + 523,359 = 21,523,359.\n\nSo, 3*(7,174,453) = 21,523,359.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 21,523,359, but when I did the digit-by-digit, I thought I had 21,523,359. So that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 21,523,359.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again because I think I might have gone too fast somewhere.\n\nLet me recap:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n12. 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n13. 1 + 3*797161 = 1 + 2391483 = 2391484\n14. 1 + 3*2391484 = 1 + 7174452 = 7174453\n15. Finally, 3*(7174453) = 21523359.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 7,174,453 as the number before the last step, but in the step-by-step, I think I have 7,174,453 as step 14, and then step 15 is 3*(7,174,453) = 21,523,359.\n\nWait, but in the step-by-step above, I have 14 steps, but the problem has 9 layers of parentheses. Let me count the number of layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), and each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nEach \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Let me see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, 1+3*(1+3)\n3. Then, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until there are 9 layers, since the problem has 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers. So, when I did my step-by-step earlier, I went up to step 15, which would be 15 layers, but that's incorrect because the problem only has 9 layers. I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, this is where I went wrong. Let me recount.\n\nThe problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, let's count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions.\n\nLet me parse the expression:\n\n3*(expression)\n\nWhere the expression is:\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1 + 3*(1+3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3))\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3)))\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3))))\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3)))))\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3))))))\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. So, when I did my earlier calculation, I went up to 15 steps, which is incorrect. I must have miscounted. So, let me correct that.\n\nLet me start over, this time correctly counting 9 layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3):\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the inner expression evaluates to 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0\n5*3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check with another method:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original problem has 9 layers of (1+3(...)), so after 9 layers, we get 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nLet me confirm the steps again:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's 9 steps, leading to 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went beyond 9 layers, which was a mistake. So the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears after the initial 3(.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, after 9 layers, we have 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the initial step count because when I first started, I thought there were more layers, but now I see it's only 9. So, I think the correct final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me just check once more by computing each step carefully.\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's 9 steps, and then 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 21 million. That was because I miscounted the layers, thinking there were more layers than there actually are. So, I need to correct that.\n\nTherefore, after carefully stepping through each layer, the correct result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the expression from the innermost parentheses outward, resulting in 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:** Start with (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. **Second Layer:** 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. **Third Layer:** 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. **Fourth Layer:** 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. **Fifth Layer:** 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. **Sixth Layer:** 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. **Seventh Layer:** 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. **Eighth Layer:** 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. **Ninth Layer:** 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to parse it from the inside out because that's usually how you handle parentheses. So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1+3. That seems straightforward. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, that result is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. So the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, so each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. That seems like a repeating pattern. Maybe I can generalize this. Let me try to see how many layers there are. Counting the number of 1+3(...), I think there are nine layers in total because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each step we go out one layer. So, maybe it's better to work from the inside out, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3.

Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That seems right.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nHmm, 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3 times this entire thing. So after computing the innermost part and working outwards, the outermost layer is 3*(result). So, let me make sure I counted the layers correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let's count the opening parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3(...), so that's the first layer.\n2. The next one is another 1+3(...), so that's the second layer.\n3. Continuing this way, I think there are nine layers in total because each time it's 1+3(...) and the outermost is 3*(...). So, perhaps I did nine layers correctly.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to the ninth layer, I got 29524, but then the entire expression is 3 times that. So, the final result would be 3 * 29524.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, 3 times 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total would be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Because sometimes when you have nested parentheses, it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3(1+3(...)) => layer 1.\n\n2. Then each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, there are 8 more opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer. So, including the first layer, that's 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to 29524, that was after 9 layers, right? So, then the outermost 3 multiplies that.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is 3*(layer 9), where layer 9 is 1+3*(layer 8), etc. So, perhaps I correctly computed up to layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me check my computations again step by step to be sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, each layer is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, starting from a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40,\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121,\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364,\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093,\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280,\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841,\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I misapplied the formula. Because sometimes, when you have a nested expression, you can model it as a geometric series.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponentiation.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, another approach: The expression inside is a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me see: Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.\n\nWait, so a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, expanding, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this way, after expanding all the way, we get a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k} + 3^n*a_0.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 =4, which is 1 + 3*1. So, perhaps a_0 would be 1, but let me check.\n\nWait, in the formula, if we consider a_1 = 4, then a_1 =1 + 3*a_0, so 4 =1 + 3*a_0 => a_0=1.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as before.\n\nSo, yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident that this is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by breaking down the nested expression from the innermost layer and work our way outwards. The problem is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\). Each subsequent layer is defined recursively as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is 3 times the result of the 9th layer:\n   - Compute \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That often helps with nested expressions. So, let me try to parse this.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost expression is 1+3. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so that level gives me 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that's 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 is 39. Then, adding 1 gives me 40. So, that level is 40.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. 3*(13) is indeed 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Yeah, that's correct. Okay, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute 3*40. That's 120, and then 1 + 120 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute 3*121. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives me 364. So, that's 364.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(1093). Let's calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nNext layer out is 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nWait a second, let me check that multiplication again. 3*29524. Maybe I should compute it differently. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3 is 27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 5*3 is 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. So, the result is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 times the result we just got, which is 88573. So, 3*88573. Let me compute that. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, the final result is 265719.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Let me compute 88573 * 3 step by step.\n\nStarting from the right:\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n- 3 * 7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n- 3 * 5 = 15, plus 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n- 3 * 8 = 24, plus 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n- 3 * 8 = 24, plus 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2\n- 3 * 0 = 0, plus 2 = 2\n- 3 * 8 = 24, but wait, actually, the number is 88573, which is five digits, so maybe I missed a digit.\n\nWait, 88573 is 8, 8, 5, 7, 3. So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n- 3 * 7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n- 3 * 5 = 15, plus 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n- 3 * 8 = 24, plus 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n- 3 * 8 = 24, plus 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2\n- Since there are no more digits, write down the 2.\n\nSo, putting it together: 2 (from the carryover), then 6, 5, 7, 1, 9. So, that's 265719. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the outermost layer was 3 times 88573, which is 265719. But let me check the original expression again to make sure I didn't miss a layer.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nCounting the number of 3(1+3(...)) layers, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(result1)\n3. 1+3*(result2)\n...\nLet me count the number of times 1+3(...) appears. Each time, it's inside another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...), and then the outermost 3(...). So, total layers: 10? Wait, no, let me count:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n...\nWait, actually, each time it's one more layer. So, in the original problem, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's like 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. So, that means there are 9 layers of 1+3(...), each nested inside the previous one. Then, the outermost is 3*(...). So, in total, 10 layers? Or 9? Wait, maybe it's 9 layers of 1+3(...), each time multiplied by 3, and then the outermost is another 3*(...). Hmm, maybe I should recount.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, 1+3, then each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3*(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the 9th layer, which would be 1+3*(...), and then the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, so if there are 9 layers of 1+3(...), each nested inside the previous one, and then the outermost is 3*(...). So, when I started computing from the innermost, I went through 9 layers, each time computing 1+3*(previous result). So, the 9th layer would be 1+3*(...), and then the outermost is 3*(9th layer result). So, in my earlier calculation, I went through 9 layers, each time computing 1+3*(previous), ending up with 88573, and then multiplied that by 3 to get 265719.\n\nWait, but let me check: when I started, the innermost was 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 1+3*40=121, then 1+3*121=364, then 1+3*364=1093, then 1+3*1093=3280, then 1+3*3280=9841, then 1+3*9841=29524, then 1+3*29524=88573. That's 9 layers, right? Because starting from 1+3, that's layer 1, then each subsequent 1+3*(...) is the next layer up to 9. Then, the outermost is 3*(88573)=265719.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression has 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, so that would mean 9 layers of 1+3(...), each nested inside the previous one, and then the outermost 3*(...). So, yes, 9 layers of 1+3, each time multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and then the final result is multiplied by 3. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nBut let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I miscounted the layers. Because in the original expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, so that would be 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, starting from 1+3, that's the first layer, then each subsequent 1+3*(...) is the next layer up to 9, and then the outermost is 3*(result). So, in my calculation, I computed up to the 9th layer as 88573, and then the outermost is 3*88573=265719.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 9 layers of 1+3*(...) and then the outermost 3*(...), making it 10 layers in total. But in the original expression, it's 3 followed by 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, perhaps the outermost is the 10th layer, but in terms of computation, I think I did it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each 1+3(...) is a layer, and the initial 3 is outside of that. So, for example, the structure is:\n\n3*(layer9)\n\nwhere layer9 = 1 + 3*(layer8)\n\nand layer8 = 1 + 3*(layer7), and so on, down to layer1 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, layer1: 4\n\nlayer2: 13\n\nlayer3: 40\n\nlayer4: 121\n\nlayer5: 364\n\nlayer6: 1093\n\nlayer7: 3280\n\nlayer8: 9841\n\nlayer9: 29524\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 layers, ending up with 88573, but that seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. layer2: 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. layer3: 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n10. outermost: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's different from before. Wait, so perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 1+3 inside. So, layer1 is the innermost 1+3, layer2 is the next 1+3*(layer1), and so on up to layer9, which is the 9th 1+3*(layer8). Then, the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, in that case, layer9 would be 1 + 3*(layer8). So, layer8 is 1 + 3*(layer7), etc.\n\nWait, so let me recast it properly:\n\nLet me define layer1 as the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nThen, layer2 = 1 + 3*(layer1)\n\nlayer3 = 1 + 3*(layer2)\n\n...\n\nup to layer9 = 1 + 3*(layer8)\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*(layer9)\n\nSo, in that case, the computation would be:\n\nlayer1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nlayer2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nlayer3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nlayer4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nlayer5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nlayer6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nlayer7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nlayer8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nlayer9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, outermost = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where I had 88573 as the 9th layer, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, let's see the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of 1+3(...) inside is 9. So, layer1 is 1+3, layer2 is 1+3*(layer1), ..., layer9 is 1+3*(layer8), and then the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, in this case, layer9 is 1 + 3*(layer8). So, layer8 is 1 + 3*(layer7), etc.\n\nSo, in this case, the final result is 3*(layer9), which is 3*(1 + 3*(layer8)).\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step:\n\nlayer1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nlayer2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nlayer3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nlayer4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nlayer5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nlayer6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nlayer7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nlayer8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nlayer9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, outermost = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so that's different from my earlier result. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me check.\n\nIn the original expression, how many times does 1+3 appear? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of 1+3(...) expressions is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, which is 9. So, that means there are 9 layers of 1+3, each nested inside the previous one, and then the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nSo, in that case, layer1 is 1+3=4\n\nlayer2=1+3*4=13\n\nlayer3=1+3*13=40\n\nlayer4=1+3*40=121\n\nlayer5=1+3*121=364\n\nlayer6=1+3*364=1093\n\nlayer7=1+3*1093=3280\n\nlayer8=1+3*3280=9841\n\nlayer9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*29524=88572\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572, not 265719 as I thought earlier. So, I must have miscounted the layers before, thinking that the outermost was another layer beyond layer9, but actually, the outermost is the multiplication by 3 after layer9.\n\nWait, so in my initial calculation, I went up to 1+3*29524=88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719, but that's incorrect because the outermost is only 3*(layer9), which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, the number of 1+3(...) is 9, each nested inside the previous, and then the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nSo, the computation should be:\n\nlayer1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nlayer2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nlayer3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nlayer4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nlayer5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nlayer6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nlayer7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nlayer8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nlayer9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's the correct approach. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went beyond layer9, computing up to 1+3*29524=88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. But that's incorrect because the outermost is only 3*(layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake in the initial approach by considering an extra layer beyond what's present in the original problem. The original problem has 9 layers of 1+3 inside, so the outermost is 3*(layer9), not another layer beyond that.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is up to layer9=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another approach. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a formula, especially if they're finite. In this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous).\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L9.\n\nSo, computing each L:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a general formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it.\n\nSuppose I have an expression like L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since this is a finite nesting (n=9), it's easier to compute each step as I did above.\n\nAlternatively, for such a recurrence, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), the closed-form can be expressed as L(n) = (3^(n) - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me see for n=1, L(1)=4. Using the formula: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1. But L(1)=4, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try to derive the closed-form.\n\nGiven L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is L(n) = homogeneous solution + particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is Lh(n) = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Lp(n) = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L(1)=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this for n=1: L(1)=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L(4)=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L(5)=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L(6)=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L(7)=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L(8)=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L(9)=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2.\n\nThus, for n=9, L(9)=(3^10 -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3^10 first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, after carefully working through each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute this result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3.

Finally, multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That seems like a common strategy for dealing with nested operations. So, let's try that.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression for clarity, labeling each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3( Layer 1 )\n\nLayer 3: 1+3( Layer 2 )\n\n...\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, actually, let's count them. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3, then multiply by 3 and add 1, and so on. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nWait, hold on, 121? That seems a bit high, but let me check: 3*40 is indeed 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, moving on.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). So, 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). That's 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let's see, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so total is 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). So, 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). That's 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, maybe a better way is to compute 29524*3 step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n- 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n- 3*3=9, write down 9.\n\nWait, actually, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should just do it the standard way:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n9\u00d73=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n5\u00d73=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that's not correct because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when multiplying by 3, it should result in a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me try again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 4\u00d73=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- 5\u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n- 2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n- Now, we've reached the end, but there's a carryover of 2, so write that down.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927.\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928.\nNo more digits, so carryover 2 becomes the next digit.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nLet me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n= 20000\u00d73 + 9000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 20\u00d73 + 4\u00d73\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1+3\u00d74=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1+3\u00d713=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1+3\u00d740=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1+3\u00d7121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1+3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1+3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1+3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1+3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. Each layer checks out, so I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can save time and reduce errors.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI recall that such recurrence relations can be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the known values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, it matches the earlier computations.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and double-checked my work, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is $1+3$. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next part is 1 plus 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so that part simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, now we have 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Let's do that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that simplifies to 121.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. So, now we have 364.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nAnother layer: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, and adding 1 gives 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate that: 3*3280 is 9840, and 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, now we have 9841.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me count how many layers we have here. The original expression is 3 multiplied by a series of (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3). Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)). Let me count them: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more set of parentheses. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, inside the first 3(...), there's another 3(...), and so on. Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested.\n\nStarting from the first layer: 3*(1+3*(...)). The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*previous. So, let's see: the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me write down the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original problem, after the first 3, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)), right? Because the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) with 9 sets of parentheses. So, starting from Layer1 as 1+3, then Layer2 is 1+3*Layer1, up to Layer9. So, that would mean after computing Layer9, we have to multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to Layer8 and then Layer9, but when I computed Layer9, I got 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572.\n\nWait, so the total would be 88,572? Let me verify my steps again because this seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me list each layer and compute them step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)=1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this again.\n\n29524*3:\n\n20,000*3=60,000\n\n9,000*3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n24*3=72\n\nNow, adding them together: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a very large number, and I want to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds a new set of parentheses. Let's count the number of times \"1+3\" appears inside.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach layer adds another (1+3). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3 followed by 9 sets of (1+3(...)). Because the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had Layer1 to Layer9, which is 9 layers, each time adding another (1+3*previous). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: the expression is 3*(...), where inside are 9 layers of (1+3*(...)). So, yes, 9 layers. So, my calculation is correct, leading to 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*previous term.\n\nSo, if we denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 would be 1 +3=4, then a_2=1+3*a1=13, a3=1+3*a2=40, etc., up to a9.\n\nSo, we can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), let's assume the particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nWait, but let's check: when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_1: n=1, a1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\na3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\na4=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to work.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if the formula applies correctly. Since a1 corresponds to n=1, and we have 9 layers, so a9 is the 9th term, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each layer adds a power of 3, then the final term before multiplying by 3 is a9=29524, and then 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but in this case, since each term is defined recursively, the formula I derived seems appropriate.\n\nSo, after verifying each step and using the formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nAfter computing all layers, we find that the innermost expression simplifies to 29524. Finally, we multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So starting from L1 to L9.\n\nWait, actually, when I look again, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so maybe L1 is the innermost (1+3), then L2 is 1 + 3*L1, and so on, up to L9, and then the outermost expression is 3*L9.

So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check: 3*1093. Let me compute 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 3279 +1 is 3280. Okay, that's correct.\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 9840 +1 = 9841.\n\nWait, 3*3280: 3280 *3. Let me compute it step by step: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 9840 +1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 29523 +1 is 29524.\n\nWait, let me check that again: 9841 *3.

So 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did all the layers correctly because that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me recap:\n\nL1: 1+3=4\n\nL2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nL3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nL4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nL5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nL6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nL7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nL8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nL9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen 3*L9=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, that seems consistent. Each step seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for L_n.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nL1 = 4\n\nL2 = 13\n\nL3 = 40\n\nL4 = 121\n\nL5 = 364\n\nL6 = 1093\n\nL7 = 3280\n\nL8 = 9841\n\nL9 = 29524\n\nHmm, let me see if there's a pattern in the numbers. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nYes, that's exactly how we defined it. So this is a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, so perhaps we can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1=4.\n\nAt n=1, L1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo that formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. For n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, which is correct because the recurrence starts at n=1 as L1, so L9 would be at n=9, which corresponds to 3^{10}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is 9, so the exponent is 10, which is correct.\n\nSo, to make sure, 3^{10} is 59049, so 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now that I've gone through them again. So I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost layer and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe outermost expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works with nested expressions like this.\n\nSo, let me start by writing down the innermost part. The innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, that part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, I have another set of parentheses: 1 + 3*(the previous result). Since the previous result was 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that level simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another level, I have another set: 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. So, that level is 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next level is 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nNext, the next set is 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that's 364.\n\nMoving out another level, it's 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute 3*364 first. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nContinuing outward, the next set is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nNow, moving out another level: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nNext, the outermost set before the initial 3 is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me calculate that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9524 is let's see, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*524 is 1572, so 27000 + 1572 is 28572. Then, adding the 60000 gives 60000 + 28572 = 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me double-check that calculation because I might have made a mistake. Let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 times 3: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nSo, now, the entire expression inside the last set of parentheses is 88573. But wait, the original expression is 3 multiplied by that entire thing. So, the problem is 3*(88573). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 88573. Let me break this down:\n\nFirst, 80000 * 3 = 240000\n8000 * 3 = 24000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n70 * 3 = 210\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way to break down 88573. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, 88573 is 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3.\n\nSo, 80000 * 3 = 240000\n8000 * 3 = 24000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n70 * 3 = 210\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nSo, 3 * 88573 is 265719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265719.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Maybe I should verify each step again.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Finally, 3 * 88573 = 265719\n\nWait, but let me check step 10 again. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this carefully.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. That seems correct.\n\nThen, step 11: 3 * 88573.\n\nLet me compute 88573 * 3 another way to confirm.\n\nCompute 88573 * 3:\n\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n- 3 * 7 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2\n- 3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1\n- 3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2\n- 3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carryover 2 (but there are no more digits, so write down 2)\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I should write it properly.\n\nWait, actually, 88573 * 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n3 * 7 = 21, write 1, carryover 2\n\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carryover 2\n\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carryover 2 (but there are no more digits, so we just add the 2 at the beginning)\n\nWait, so that would give 265719. Let me write it out:\n\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n- 3 * 7 = 21, write 1, carryover 2\n- 3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1\n- 3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carryover 2\n- 3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carryover 2\n- Since there are no more digits, we write the 2 before the 6, making it 265719.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 * 88573 is indeed 265719.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I broke down 88573 into 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3, and then multiplied each by 3, I might have made an error in the breakdown. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 88573 is actually 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3. So, when I multiply each part by 3:\n\n- 80000 * 3 = 240000\n- 8000 * 3 = 24000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 70 * 3 = 210\n- 3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n240000 + 24000 = 264000\n\n264000 + 1500 = 265500\n\n265500 + 210 = 265710\n\n265710 + 9 = 265719\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So, 3 * 88573 is indeed 265719.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistake in the earlier steps. Maybe I can check one of the earlier steps again.\n\nFor example, step 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 again.\n\n3*1000 = 3000\n\n3*93 = 279\n\nSo, 3000 + 279 = 3279\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, step 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280.\n\n3*3000 = 9000\n\n3*280 = 840\n\n9000 + 840 = 9840\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841.\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*841 = let's compute 800*3 = 2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 2400 + 120 = 2520 + 3 = 2523\n\nSo, 27000 + 2523 = 29523\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9524: Let's break it down.\n\n9524 * 3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nSo, 27000 + 1500 = 28500 + 72 = 28572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 60000 + 28572 = 88572\n\nThen, 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\nSo, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final result is 265719.\n\nWait, but let me just consider another approach to see if I can confirm this result without computing each step again. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can help.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps this forms a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me try to represent the expression as a recurrence relation. Let's denote each level as a_n, where n is the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let's see, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find the general solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1\n\n-2D = 1\n\nD = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 10 layers (from a_1 to a_10). So, a_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, a_10 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573. That's consistent with what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and the general solution, I arrive at the same result. That gives me more confidence that 265719 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nExpanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this expansion, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1.\n\nSo, perhaps the general term is a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nWait, sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches our earlier result.\n\nYes, so a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=10, a_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2 = 88573.\n\nThen, 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is 265719.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, yes, 3^11 is 177147.\n\nThen, 177147 - 1 = 177146, divided by 2 is 88573. Then, 3*88573 is 265719.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about this is that each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a base-3 expansion or something, but I think the recurrence approach is sufficient.\n\nSo, in summary, by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each step carefully, and then verifying with a general formula for the recurrence relation, I arrive at the final answer of 265719.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{265719}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

    "text": " Maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost part and working my way out. That might be the way to go, because if I try to compute it from the outside, I might get lost with all those parentheses. So, let's try that approach.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nCompute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's easy, that's 4. So now, the expression becomes:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))))\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me check. The innermost part is (1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). Wait, actually, no. Let me count how many levels deep the innermost (1 + 3) is.\n\nLooking at the original expression, each level adds another 3(1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of 3s after the first one. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then moving outwards each time. So, perhaps the innermost is the last (1 + 3), then the next one is 3 times that plus 1, and so on. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., where L1 is the innermost. So:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute L2: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute L3: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute L4: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute L5: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute L6: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute L7: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute L8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute L9: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(L9), which is 3*29524.\n\nCompute that: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I did each step correctly because the numbers are getting big quickly, and I might have made a mistake in multiplication or addition.\n\nLet me go through each step again more carefully:\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3*(29524). Compute that: 29524*3. Let's compute:\n\n29524*3:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, actually, that's not the right breakdown. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, but when I add the digits:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nWait, adding all these: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but given that each step multiplies by 3 and adds 1, the numbers grow exponentially, so it's plausible.\n\nLet me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can express this recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*f(n-1), except for the base case.\n\nWait, in our problem, the innermost layer is (1 + 3), which is f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I computed earlier. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for f(n). Let's see, since each f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is solving f(n) = 3*f(n-1), which has the solution f(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say f_p.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence: f_p = 1 + 3*f_p.\n\nSolving for f_p: f_p - 3*f_p = 1 => -2*f_p = 1 => f_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: f(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: f(n) = (3^{n+1}) / 2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: f(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: f(3)=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: f(4)=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: f(5)=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: f(6)=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: f(7)=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: f(8)=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: f(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, f(9)=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88572. That's consistent with my previous calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see the entire expression as a geometric series or something similar, but given that each term is built upon the previous one with multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, it's more of a linear recurrence as I did before.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's try to compute the entire expression without breaking it into layers. Let me see if that's feasible.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine 3s after the first one. Wait, actually, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach 3(1+... is a layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3 appears. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each step adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because each \"3(\" adds a new layer, and the original expression has 9 such \"3(\"s after the first 3. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by 9 layers of 3(...). So, n=9.\n\nUsing the formula f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found earlier, then the innermost value is f(1)=4, and each layer adds another exponent.\n\nBut in our problem, the entire expression is 3*f(9). So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, wait, because f(n) is defined as the value at each layer, and the outermost layer is 3*f(9). So, perhaps the entire expression can be written as 3*f(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThen, 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, when expanded, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nLet me try to expand it step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nThen: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent again.\n\nWait, maybe I can see this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to write the expression without the parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see each step as a function. Let me try to represent the entire expression as a sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))) with 9 threes. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and we have 9 layers, perhaps the total expression can be written as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Wait, as we saw before, that's 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, that's another way to look at it.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I can compute each step using exponents. Let me see.\n\nEach time we go a layer out, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from 1, each step is 1 + 3^n, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum can be represented as a geometric series where each term is 3^k, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me try to see the pattern in the values we've computed:\n\nf(1) = 4 = 3 + 1\n\nf(2) = 13 = 3*4 +1\n\nWait, no, f(2)=1 + 3*4=13.\n\nSimilarly, f(3)=1 + 3*13=40.\n\nWhich is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nWait, perhaps the expression can be written as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula we derived earlier: f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9 layers, f(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, let me just confirm that I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach \"3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\" after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3( is a new layer.\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by 1 + 3(...), which is the first layer.\n\nThen, each \"3(\" adds another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers after the initial 3. Therefore, n=9 in our formula.\n\nThus, f(9)=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try to compute it step by step again, maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers.\n\nCompute each layer:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13\n\nL3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nL4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nL6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nL7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nL8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nL9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, to make sure, I can compute each layer using the formula f(n)=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, f(9)=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps, and each time, the result is 88572. So, I can be confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 3s and 1s. By breaking it down from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to parse it.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, the innermost expression is $1 + 3$. That seems straightforward. So, let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes one level up: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))$.\n\nOkay, so now, the next layer is $1 + 3(4)$. Let's compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 plus 12 is 13. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))))$.\n\nHmm, so now, moving one layer out, we have $1 + 3(13)$. Let me calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 plus 39 is 40. So, replacing that, the expression is now: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))))$.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is $1 + 3(40)$. 3 times 40 is 120, and 1 plus 120 is 121. So, substituting back, we have: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))))$.\n\nNext, moving out another layer: $1 + 3(121)$. Let's compute that. 3 times 121 is 363, and 1 plus 363 is 364. So now, the expression becomes: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))))$.\n\nMoving out another layer: $1 + 3(364)$. 3 times 364 is 1092, and 1 plus 1092 is 1093. So, replacing that, we get: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093))))$.\n\nNext layer: $1 + 3(1093)$. 3 times 1093 is 3279, and 1 plus 3279 is 3280. So, substituting back, the expression is now: $3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280)))$.\n\nMoving out another layer: $1 + 3(3280)$. 3 times 3280 is 9840, and 1 plus 9840 is 9841. So, replacing that, we have: $3(1 + 3(9841))$.\n\nNext, compute $1 + 3(9841)$. 3 times 9841 is... let me calculate that. 9841 times 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3 times 9841 is 29523, and 1 plus 29523 is 29524. So, now the expression is: $3(29524)$.\n\nFinally, compute 3 times 29524. Let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 times 29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 times 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 87572? Wait, that doesn't match my previous calculation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n9\u00d73=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but when I did it the other way, I thought it was 88572, but when I broke it down, I thought 29524\u00d73 is 88572. But earlier, when I added 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12, that was 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, yes, it's 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. Wait, no, let me check again:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the units digit:\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\nNext digit: 5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\nNext digit: 9\u00d73=27, write 7, carryover 2.\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that's 87572. But that contradicts the earlier total. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit approach. Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n- Units place: 4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- Ten-thousands place: 9\u00d73=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But when I did the other way, I thought it was 88572. Wait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the places when I broke it down into 20000, 9000, etc. Let me try that again.\n\n29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4.\n\nSo, 20000\u00d73=60000\n9000\u00d73=27000\n500\u00d73=1500\n20\u00d73=60\n4\u00d73=12\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 +12=88572\n\nSo, according to this, it's 88572.\n\nBut when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. Hmm, that's a problem because they should be the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me check again:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext digit: 9\u00d73=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that's 87572. But according to the other method, it's 88572. There's a discrepancy here. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of digits. Let me check the original number: 29524. It's a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply by 3, the result should be 87572, which is 5 digits as well. But according to the other method, it's 88572, which is also 5 digits. Wait, but 29524\u00d73: let me compute it another way.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d73 as (30000 - 476) \u00d73 = 30000\u00d73 - 476\u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Oh! So that's correct. So, the digit-by-digit method must have an error. Wait, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits when writing down the result. Let me try the digit-by-digit method again, carefully:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n- Units place: 4\u00d73=12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5\u00d73=15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the thousands place digit is 9, so 9\u00d73=27, plus the carryover of 1 from the hundreds place. So, 27 +1=28. So, write down 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8. Write down 8.\n\nWait, so writing it out:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n2 (units)\n7 (tens)\n5 (hundreds)\n8 (thousands)\n8 (ten-thousands)\n\nSo, the number is 88572. Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. I must have miscalculated the thousands place. So, the correct result is 88572. That matches the other method. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial digit-by-digit multiplication by not correctly adding the carryover at the thousands place.\n\nSo, now I'm confident that 29524 \u00d73 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4\n2. Next layer: 1+3\u00d74=1+12=13\n3. Next: 1+3\u00d713=1+39=40\n4. Next: 1+3\u00d740=1+120=121\n5. Next: 1+3\u00d7121=1+363=364\n6. Next: 1+3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093\n7. Next: 1+3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280\n8. Next: 1+3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841\n9. Next: 1+3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524\n10. Finally: 3\u00d729524=88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and I didn't skip any layers. So, the answer should be 88572.\n\nI think I've got it. So, the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed starting from the innermost parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the inside out, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually helps with nested expressions. Let me write it down step by step.\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so now I can replace that innermost part with 4. So the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(that result). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So that would be 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So now we have 40 there.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So that layer becomes 121. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So now we have 364. Next layer is 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364, let me do that: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 is 1093. So that layer is 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So that's 3280. Next layer is 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So now we're at 9841.\n\nAnother layer out: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So that layer is 29524.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's calculate 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So now we're at 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(that result). So 3*88573. Let me compute that. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding all those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So the final result is 265719.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again to make sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n11. Finally, 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nHmm, I went through each step again, and it seems correct. Maybe that's the right answer after all. But just to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the number of layers, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I can express this as a recurrence relation. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so maybe I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined. Let's plug into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\nD = 1 + 3D\nThen, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n9/2 = 3C\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works.\n\nSo, if I have 9 layers, starting from the innermost, which is a_1, then the outermost layer is a_9. So let me compute a_9 using this formula:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, but earlier I had a_9 as 88573. That doesn't match. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused with the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen each layer wraps around that. Let's count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of such terms.\n\nEach time, after the first 3(...), there are 8 more (1+3(...)) terms. Wait, actually, no, maybe I should count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo the number of \"1+3(\" is 9, but the innermost is just (1+3). So that would mean 9 layers. So a_9 is 29524 as per the formula. But in my initial step-by-step calculation, I ended up with 88573 as the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, which would then give 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9 is 29524, so the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29524, so the total would be 3*29524 = 88572. But that's conflicting with my initial step-by-step approach where I had 88573 before the final multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me recount the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, not 9. Let me check again.\n\nIn the original problem, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the first (1+3(...)), each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So let's count:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3). That's layer 1.\n\n2. Then, wrapping that is (1+3(...)), which is layer 2.\n\n3. Then layer 3, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first (1+3(...)), each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3). That's 1.\n\nThen, each layer wraps around that, so:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\n\nLayer 3: (1+3(Layer2))\n\nAnd so on until Layer 9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nSo that would mean 9 layers, so a_9 is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\nStarting with (1+3) =4,\n\nthen 1+3*4=13,\n\nthen 1+3*13=40,\n\nthen 1+3*40=121,\n\nthen 1+3*121=364,\n\nthen 1+3*364=1093,\n\nthen 1+3*1093=3280,\n\nthen 1+3*3280=9841,\n\nthen 1+3*9841=29524,\n\nthen 1+3*29524=88573,\n\nthen 3*88573=265719.\n\nWait, that's 9 layers, but according to the formula, a_9=29524, so the outermost expression is 29524, so total is 3*29524=88572, which is different from 265719.\n\nWait, I'm confused now. There must be a mistake here. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts the number of layers as n, but in the problem, the number of layers is 9, so a_9=29524, so the total is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my step-by-step approach, I had 9 layers, ending up with 88573 before multiplying by 3, leading to 265719.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the first (1+3(...)), each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's see:\n\n1. The first layer is (1+3).\n\n2. Then, the next is (1+3(1+3)).\n\n3. Then, (1+3(1+3(1+3))).\n\nContinuing this way, each time adding another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of closing parentheses after each 3.\n\nWait, the expression ends with ...))))))).\n\nSo, after the innermost (1+3), there are 8 closing parentheses. So that would mean 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the formula a_n is defined as the nth layer, starting from a_1 as the innermost. So in the problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9=29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step approach, I ended up with 88573 before multiplying by 3, which would give 265719. But according to the formula, it's 88572.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong in my initial step-by-step?\n\nLet me go through my step-by-step again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3=4.\n\n2. Next layer:1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\n3. Next:1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\n4. Next:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\n5. Next:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\n6. Next:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\n7. Next:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\n8. Next:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\n9. Next:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\n10. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so in my initial step-by-step, I had 9 layers, ending up with 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. But earlier, I thought I had 88573 before multiplying by 3, which was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial step-by-step. Let me recount:\n\nWait, in the initial step-by-step, I think I went one layer too far. Let me check:\n\nThe problem is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)=4.\n\n2. Then, 1+3*4=13.\n\n3. Then, 1+3*13=40.\n\n4. Then, 1+3*40=121.\n\n5. Then, 1+3*121=364.\n\n6. Then, 1+3*364=1093.\n\n7. Then, 1+3*1093=3280.\n\n8. Then, 1+3*3280=9841.\n\n9. Then, 1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo in my initial step-by-step, I think I mistakenly added an extra layer, thinking that the expression had 10 layers, but it's actually 9 layers, so the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. (1+3)=4.\n\n2. 1+3*4=13.\n\n3. 1+3*13=40.\n\n4. 1+3*40=121.\n\n5. 1+3*121=364.\n\n6. 1+3*364=1093.\n\n7. 1+3*1093=3280.\n\n8. 1+3*3280=9841.\n\n9. 1+3*9841=29524.\n\n10. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, resulting in 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, so where did I get 88573 before? It must have been a miscalculation in the initial step-by-step. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, when I did the initial step-by-step, I think I miscounted the layers. Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)=4.\n\n2. Next layer:1+3*4=13.\n\n3. Next:1+3*13=40.\n\n4. Next:1+3*40=121.\n\n5. Next:1+3*121=364.\n\n6. Next:1+3*364=1093.\n\n7. Next:1+3*1093=3280.\n\n8. Next:1+3*3280=9841.\n\n9. Next:1+3*9841=29524.\n\n10. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572, not 265719. So I must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step, probably adding an extra layer or miscalculating somewhere.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, a_9=29524, so 3*a_9=88572, which matches the corrected step-by-step. So the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in my initial step-by-step, I thought I had 9 layers, but according to the formula, a_9 is 29524, which is correct, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just stick with the formula. So, using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, where n is the number of layers, which is 9. So a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 3*(1+3*(...)) ending up with 265719, which must be wrong. So the correct approach is to recognize the pattern, use the recurrence relation, find the closed-form, and compute accordingly.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Recognize that each layer is of the form a_n=1+3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1=4.\n\n2. Find the closed-form solution: a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\n3. For n=9, a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=29524.\n\n4. Multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be absolutely sure. Let me compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\n3*29524:\n\nFirst, 3*20000=60000.\n\n3*9000=27000.\n\n3*500=1500.\n\n3*24=72.\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake in my initial step-by-step approach by miscounting the number of layers or miscalculating somewhere, leading to an incorrect final result. But by using the formula, I arrived at the correct answer of 88572.\n\nAnother way to verify is to compute each layer step by step, ensuring that each step is correct. Let me try that again:\n\n1. Start with (1+3)=4.\n\n2. Next layer:1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\n3. Next:1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\n4. Next:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\n5. Next:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\n6. Next:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\n7. Next:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\n8. Next:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\n9. Next:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\n10. Finally, multiply by 3:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think earlier I must have added an extra layer or miscalculated the multiplication step, leading to the wrong result of 265719. But now, after carefully checking each step and using the formula, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing that the expression is a nested sequence of terms of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous result})\\). We can break down the problem step by step, starting from the innermost part and working our way out.\n\n1. Compute the innermost part:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That might make it easier. So, let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part: The innermost expression is (1+3). That's straightforward. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Then, moving one level out, we have (1+3(...)). So, if I replace the innermost part with 4, the next layer would be (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. So, that part simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Since the previous result was 13, this becomes (1 + 3*13). Calculating that: 3 times 13 is 39, and then 1 plus 39 is 40. So, now that layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)). The previous result was 40, so this is (1 + 3*40). Let's compute that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, this layer becomes 121.\n\nNext layer out is again (1 + 3*(previous result)), which is (1 + 3*121). Calculating that: 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, this simplifies to 364.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*364). Let me compute 3*364 first. 3 times 300 is 900, 3 times 64 is 192, so adding those together, 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, this layer is 1093.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, this layer is 3280.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is (1 + 3*3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, this layer simplifies to 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, this layer is 29524.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So, this layer simplifies to 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is (1 + 3*88573). Let's compute 3*88573. 80000 times 3 is 240000, 8000 times 3 is 24000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 70 times 3 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding these together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. So, this layer simplifies to 265720.\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times all of that. So, after computing the innermost parentheses and working outwards, we ended up with 265720. So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by 265720. Let me compute that. 265720 times 3: 200000 times 3 is 600000, 60000 times 3 is 180000, 5000 times 3 is 15000, 700 times 3 is 2100, 20 times 3 is 60, and 0 times 3 is 0. Adding those up: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3 times 265720 is 797160.\n\nWait, but that seems like a very large number. Let me double-check my calculations because maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again to make sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Next: (1 + 3*88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times 265720, which is 797160.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors. Let me check each multiplication step.\n\nStarting from step 2: 3*4=12, correct.\n\nStep 3: 3*13=39, correct.\n\nStep 4: 3*40=120, correct.\n\nStep 5: 3*121=363, correct.\n\nStep 6: 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Correct.\n\nStep 7: 3*1093. Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Correct.\n\nStep 8: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Correct.\n\nStep 9: 3*9841. Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Correct.\n\nStep 10: 3*29524. Let me compute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Correct.\n\nStep 11: 3*88573. 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000+24000=264000, +1500=265500, +210=265710, +9=265719. Correct.\n\nThen, adding 1 gives 265720. Then, multiplying by 3: 265720*3. Let's compute that again:\n\n265720 * 3:\n\n200000*3=600000\n\n60000*3=180000\n\n5000*3=15000\n\n700*3=2100\n\n20*3=60\n\n0*3=0\n\nAdding these: 600000 + 180000 = 780000\n\n780000 + 15000 = 795000\n\n795000 + 2100 = 797100\n\n797100 + 60 = 797160\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 797,160.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to do each multiplication step by step, because that's time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about the structure of the expression.\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 3 times (1 plus the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to represent this recursively.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost expression, which is 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers of 3*(...). Wait, actually, let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's one layer. Then each additional (1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3 adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \u2192 1 layer\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(...))) \u2192 2 layers\n3. Continuing, up to 9 layers because each \"1+3\" adds a new layer.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add a new layer. So, the number of layers is 9, because from the innermost to the outermost, we have 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, if I can find a formula for a_n, that might save time. Let's see, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula seems to work.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, but earlier when I computed step by step, a_9 was 265720, but according to this formula, it's 29524. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, let's count the number of (1+3(...)) layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 2\n3. Each additional (1+3 adds another layer.\n\nWait, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first ( after 3 is the start of layer 1, then each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 1\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(...))) \u2192 layer 2\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(...)))) \u2192 layer 3\n4. Continue until we reach the end.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1. Then each additional layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 2\n3. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 3\n4. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 4\n5. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 5\n6. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 6\n7. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 7\n8. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 8\n9. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 9\n\nSo, total of 9 layers, which would mean n=9 in our formula. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. But when I computed step by step earlier, I ended up with a_9 as 265720, which is much larger. That suggests that I made a mistake in my step-by-step computation.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me check my step-by-step again. When I computed step by step, I started with (1+3)=4, then each next layer was (1 + 3*previous). Let me recount:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1+3)=4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n4. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121\n5. Layer 5:1 +3*121=364\n6. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n7. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n8. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n9. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Wait, but earlier I thought I had 265720, but that was because I miscounted the layers. Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...), so the total expression is 3 times a_9. So, if a_9 is 29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the step-by-step computation, I thought I ended up with 265720, but that was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. Let me recount.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 265720, but that was because I thought there were more layers. Let me recount the layers correctly.\n\nWait, the problem has 9 layers of (1+3(...)), so a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a_9=265720, which was wrong because I thought there were more layers. Wait, let me recount the number of layers correctly.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 2\n3. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 3\n4. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 4\n5. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 5\n6. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 6\n7. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 7\n8. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 8\n9. (1+3(...)) \u2192 layer 9\n\nSo, 9 layers in total, meaning a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a_9=265720, which must be incorrect. Let me check that.\n\nWait, when I did the step-by-step earlier, I think I miscounted the layers. Let me recount:\n\n1. Layer 1: (1+3)=4\n2. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13\n3. Layer 3:1+3*13=40\n4. Layer 4:1+3*40=121\n5. Layer 5:1+3*121=364\n6. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093\n7. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280\n8. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841\n9. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers, so a_9=29524, and then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 265720, which must have been a miscalculation. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to (1 +3*88573)=265720, but that was because I thought there were more layers. Wait, no, in the problem, the expression ends with nine layers, so after a_9=29524, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the number of layers. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1+3), each additional (1+3 adds a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 layer 1\n2. (1+3(1+3)) \u2192 layer 2\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u2192 layer 3\n4. Continue until the outermost.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), so the innermost is (1+3), then each additional layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- The first ( is at position 2: 3(1+3(...))\n- Then, each subsequent ( adds another layer.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of (1+3(...)) sections, which is 9, as previously determined.\n\nTherefore, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a_9=265720, which must have been incorrect because I thought there were more layers. So, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the initial step-by-step was incorrect because I miscounted the layers, thinking there were more layers than there actually are.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to recognize that there are 9 layers, compute a_9=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form (1 + 3 * previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using a formula for the nth term of the sequence, we find the innermost value and work outward. The expression simplifies to 3 multiplied by the ninth term of the sequence, which is 29524. Thus, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outwards. Let me try to parse this. Starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, (1 + 3) equals 4. Then, moving one step out, we have (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, substituting the 4 in, it becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that part simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, plugging in 13, it's (1 + 3*13). Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that simplifies to 40. Continuing this way, each time I substitute the result back into the next layer. Let me try to write this down step by step to keep track.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, let me check that. Each time I go a layer out, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. So, that's 9 layers in total, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the expression. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there's (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, from the innermost, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)), right? Because the innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, and each time we compute the next layer as 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me list the results again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we reach 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to follow a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with n layers. In this case, n=9 layers inside the outermost 3.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_{k} = 1 + 3a_{k-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found.\n\nThe recurrence is a_k = 3a_{k-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_k - 3a_{k-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3a_p + 1.\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3a_p = 1 => -2a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When k=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Good, so that's consistent.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula, and it confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each a_k is following the formula (3^{k+1} - 1)/2, so for k=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nI think I've thought through this thoroughly. I broke it down step by step, checked each layer, and even used a formula approach to verify. So, I'm pretty confident the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value at each stage. After simplifying all layers, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, moving one layer out, it's (1+3(1+3)), then (1+3(1+3(1+3))), and so on. So, each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next layer. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me write down each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*4\n3. Then, the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see: starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so let's count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me try to count: The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me count the number of layers. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each time moving out, so the number of layers is 9, because each time \"1+3(\" is one layer, and the outermost is multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. So, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first (1+3), then each subsequent (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) terms.

But when I look at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by a term that has 8 layers of (1+3(...)), right?

But wait, let me check Layer7 again: 1 + 3*1093.\n\n1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279.

Is there a formula for such a nested expression? Because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, etc., up to L8. Then, the total expression is 3*L8.\n\nAlternatively, this seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute it without computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence relation. Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on, up to L8.\n\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence relation into the general solution.\n\nWe have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. The initial condition is L1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, L1 corresponds to n=1. Let me check:\n\nWhen n=1, L1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4\n\nWe already found that B = -1/2, so:\n\n3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=1: L1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=8, which is our Layer8:\n\nL8 = (3^{9} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19,683\n\nSo, L8 = (19,683 -1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*L8 = 3*9,841 = 29,523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrive at the same result, I feel confident that 29,523 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing it another way, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence, not a geometric series. But the closed-form solution we derived using the recurrence relation gives us L8 = (3^9 -1)/2, so that's solid.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers inside. So, using the formula, the innermost layer is 3^1, then each layer adds another exponent, so the total number of 3s multiplied together is 3^8, but with additions of 1 at each step. So, the formula we derived earlier is the way to go.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so it's similar to 3^n - something. But our formula already accounts for that.\n\nSo, I think I've verified it sufficiently. The answer is 29,523.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 9841 = 29523\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{29523}"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, the innermost expression is 1+3. That's simple enough: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, let me replace that part first. So, starting from the inside:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that part becomes 13.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, each step, I'm replacing the innermost parentheses with its value, then moving outward. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nLet me label each level from the inside out as Level 1 to Level 9, maybe. Let's see how many levels there are. Counting the number of opening parentheses, I think there are nine levels. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9.\n\nWait, actually, the original problem is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, each step, I can compute the innermost part first, then work my way out.\n\nLet me try to compute each level step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Level 9, which is 29524, we have the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nHmm, 3*29524. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each level. Let me go through each level again to confirm.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent level builds on that.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by 29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me check Level 9 again. So, Level 8 was 9841, right? Then Level 9 is 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841: 9841 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n9841 \u00d7 3:\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3.\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 5, carryover 2.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut wait, 9841 is a four-digit number, so:\n\n9841\n\u00d7    3\n------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3.\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 write 5, carryover 2.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29 \u2192 write 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2 at the beginning.\n\nWait, that would give 29523. So, 3 \u00d7 9841 = 29523. Then, Level 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 \u00d7 29524. Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method. Maybe by breaking down 29524 into parts.\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 20000 = 60000.\n\n3 \u00d7 9000 = 27000.\n\n3 \u00d7 500 = 1500.\n\n3 \u00d7 20 = 60.\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if I've counted the levels correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression to make sure I didn't miss a level.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(...)\" is a level. Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first is 3(, then inside is 1+3(, then another 1+3(, etc. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 levels of \"1+3(\", starting from the second character. So, maybe I only went up to Level 9, which would be correct because the innermost is Level 1, and the outermost is Level 9. So, when I computed up to Level 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, that should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by actually writing out each level:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the number of levels. Let me recount the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Each \"1+3(\" is a new level. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen each time it's wrapped in another 1+3(...). So, the number of levels is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" instances.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(:\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\" before the innermost 1+3. So, that would make 9 levels. So, my initial calculation up to Level 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nWait, but let me check the computation again because 88572 seems a bit large, and I want to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLet me go through each level again:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see a pattern here. Each level is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A \u2192 9/2 = 3A \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for level 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, and it gives the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations when I was doing the step-by-step. It's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic when dealing with large numbers.\n\nLet me recompute the levels:\n\nLevel 1: 1+3=4.\n\nLevel 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLevel 3:1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLevel4:1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLevel5:1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLevel6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLevel7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLevel8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLevel9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\n3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Wait, but in this case, each term is multiplied by 3, so it's more like a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nWait, the formula I used earlier is correct, so I think that's solid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost expression and work our way out step by step.\n\n1. **Innermost expression:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next level:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next level:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next level:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next level:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next level:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next level:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next level:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next level:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me try to write this out step by step. Let's denote each inner expression as a separate term so I don't get confused. Let me start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. So, the innermost part is 1+3. Let me compute that first. \n\n1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so that part is easy. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer is 13. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. \n\nContinuing this process, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). Let me calculate that. 3*40 is 120, and adding 1 gives 121. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121). Hmm, 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. \n\nWait, that seems a bit big, but okay. Let me go on. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364). Calculating that: 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. \n\nContinuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. \n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. \n\nWait a second, that seems really large. Let me check if I did that correctly. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me try again. 29524 is 29000 + 524. So, 29000*3 is 87000, and 524*3 is 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. \n\nWait, that seems even bigger. Let me verify. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, 29524 is 29000 + 524, so 29000*3 is 87000, and 524*3 is 1572. So, 87000 + 1572 is indeed 88572. Adding 1 gives 88573. Okay, that's correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. Hmm, 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Wait, no, 88573 is 88000 + 573. So, 88000*3 is 264000, and 573*3 is 1719. Adding those together: 264000 + 1719 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. \n\nWait, that seems really huge. Let me check again. 88573 * 3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000 + 24000 = 264000, +1500 = 265500, +210 = 265710, +9 = 265719. Adding 1 gives 265720. Yep, that's correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute 3*265720. 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Wait, 265720 is 265000 + 720. So, 265000*3 is 795000, and 720*3 is 2160. Adding those together: 795000 + 2160 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161. \n\nWait, that's massive. Let me make sure I did that correctly. 265720 * 3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Wait, but 265720 is 265,720. So, 265,000 *3 is 795,000, and 720*3 is 2,160. So, 795,000 + 2,160 = 797,160. Adding 1 gives 797,161. Correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(797161). Let me compute 3*797161. Hmm, 700000*3 is 2,100,000, 90,000*3 is 270,000, 7,000*3 is 21,000, 100*3 is 300, 60*3 is 180, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000, +21,000 = 2,391,000, +300 = 2,391,300, +180 = 2,391,480, +3 = 2,391,483. Then, adding 1 gives 2,391,484. \n\nWait, that's over two million. Let me verify. 797,161 * 3: 700,000*3=2,100,000, 90,000*3=270,000, 7,000*3=21,000, 100*3=300, 60*3=180, 1*3=3. So, adding up: 2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000, +21,000 = 2,391,000, +300 = 2,391,300, +180 = 2,391,480, +3 = 2,391,483. Adding 1 gives 2,391,484. Correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(2,391,484). Let me compute 3*2,391,484. Hmm, 2,000,000*3 is 6,000,000, 300,000*3 is 900,000, 90,000*3 is 270,000, 1,000*3 is 3,000, 400*3 is 1,200, 80*3 is 240, 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000, +270,000 = 7,170,000, +3,000 = 7,173,000, +1,200 = 7,174,200, +240 = 7,174,440, +12 = 7,174,452. Then, adding 1 gives 7,174,453. \n\nWait, that's over seven million. Let me check again. 2,391,484 * 3: 2,000,000*3=6,000,000, 300,000*3=900,000, 90,000*3=270,000, 1,000*3=3,000, 400*3=1,200, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. So, adding up: 6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000, +270,000 = 7,170,000, +3,000 = 7,173,000, +1,200 = 7,174,200, +240 = 7,174,440, +12 = 7,174,452. Adding 1 gives 7,174,453. Correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(7,174,453). Let me compute 3*7,174,453. Hmm, 7,000,000*3 is 21,000,000, 100,000*3 is 300,000, 70,000*3 is 210,000, 4,000*3 is 12,000, 400*3 is 1,200, 50*3 is 150, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 21,000,000 + 300,000 = 21,300,000, +210,000 = 21,510,000, +12,000 = 21,522,000, +1,200 = 21,523,200, +150 = 21,523,350, +9 = 21,523,359. Then, adding 1 gives 21,523,360. \n\nWait, that's over 21 million. Let me verify. 7,174,453 * 3: 7,000,000*3=21,000,000, 100,000*3=300,000, 70,000*3=210,000, 4,000*3=12,000, 400*3=1,200, 50*3=150, 3*3=9.

Correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(21,523,360). Let me compute 3*21,523,360. Hmm, 20,000,000*3 is 60,000,000, 1,500,000*3 is 4,500,000, 23,000*3 is 69,000, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180. So, adding those together: 60,000,000 + 4,500,000 = 64,500,000, +69,000 = 64,569,000, +900 = 64,569,900, +180 = 64,570,080. Then, adding 1 gives 64,570,081. \n\nWait, that's over 64 million.

Adding 1 gives 15,695,281,804. Correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(15,695,281,804). Let me compute 3*15,695,281,804. Hmm, 10,000,000,000*3 is 30,000,000,000, 5,000,000,000*3 is 15,000,000,000, 600,000,000*3 is 1,800,000,000, 90,000,000*3 is 270,000,000, 5,000,000*3 is 15,000,000, 200,000*3 is 600,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 30,000,000,000 + 15,000,000,0"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That seems like a logical approach since each part depends on the next one. Let me write it down step by step to visualize it better.\n\nStarting from the innermost part, which is 1+3. So, let's compute that first:\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3*(result from the previous step). So, substituting the 4 we just got:\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that step gives me 13. Now, moving another level out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, substituting 13:\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so now we're at 40. Let me keep going, because each step seems to be building on the previous one. Next level out:\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWhoa, that's getting big quickly. Let me write down each step to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n10. Finally, the outermost: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm counting the steps correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count the number of times I see 1 + 3(...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n...\nUp to the ninth one. So, I think I have nine layers here. So, each time I compute a layer, I replace the innermost part with its value and compute the next one.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each next layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting after the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. So, let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until we reach the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, how many times does 1 + 3 appear as a separate term? Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, each step I did earlier corresponds to one layer. So, if I did 9 layers, that's correct. Let me confirm:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after computing all nine layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, the final step is:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 29524.\n\nWell, 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572. So, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from bottom up: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the intermediate steps. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. 363 + 1 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. 1092 + 1 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000 + 840 = 9840. 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, finally, 3*29524: as I did earlier, it's 88572. So, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Maybe a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 4, a_2 is 13, a_3 is 40, etc., up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI know that such a recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form formula. Let me try to find that.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and has the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c=1 and r=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^{n} + (c/(r - 1)). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, more accurately, the solution for a linear recurrence relation a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 4. Let me adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nLet me write the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + (1)/(3 - 1) = A*3^{n} + 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} + 1/2 => 4 = 3A + 0.5 => 3A = 4 - 0.5 = 3.5 => A = 3.5 / 3 = 7/6.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (7/6)*3^{n} + 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, since 3^{n} = 3*3^{n-1}, but perhaps it's better to write it as:\n\na_n = (7/6)*3^{n} + 1/2.\n\nWait, let me check if this formula works for n=1:\n\na_1 = (7/6)*3^1 + 1/2 = (7/6)*3 + 1/2 = (7/2) + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (7/6)*3^2 + 1/2 = (7/6)*9 + 1/2 = (63/6) + 1/2 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11. Wait, but earlier we had a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the recurrence. Let me check.\n\nWait, in our problem, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. Then a_2 is 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then a_3 is 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nBut according to the formula I just derived, a_2 should be (7/6)*3^2 + 1/2 = 63/6 + 1/2 = 10.5 + 0.5 = 11, which is not matching the actual value of 13. So, something's wrong with my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me try again.\n\nThe standard solution for a recurrence relation a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nBut in our case, the initial condition is a_1 = 4, not a_0. So, perhaps I need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nLet me let n start at 1. So, a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 3*a_1 + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 13.\n\na_3 = 3*a_2 + 1 = 3*13 + 1 = 40.\n\nSo, the general solution should be a_n = 3^{n}*(a_1) + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 3^{k}.\n\nWait, because each step adds a term involving 3^{k}.\n\nWait, let me think of it as a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nA particular solution can be found as a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and the entire original expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified each part, so I'm pretty sure the solution is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost part:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move to the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Continue to the next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Next level:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7.

    "text": " Maybe I can solve this from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. Let me try to write this out step by step.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer gives me 13.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, I have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So that's 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, now I have 40.\n\nNext layer out, it's 1 + 3*(40). Let me do that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. Hmm, that's a bigger number. I'm noticing a pattern here, but let me keep going.\n\nThe next one is 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. Wow, okay, that's a jump. Let me write that down as 364.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(364). Calculating that: 3*364. Let me do that step by step. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. That's a big number, 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. That's 9841.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me calculate 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. That's 29524.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. That's 88573.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me check that calculation again because 3*29524. Maybe I made a mistake in breaking it down. Let me try another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. So, 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yeah, that seems right. So, 88572 + 1 is 88573.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next one is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute 3*88573. Hmm, that's going to be a big number. Let me break it down: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. That's 265720.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I might have made a mistake there. Let me double-check 3*88573. Let me compute it step by step. 88573 times 3: 3*3 is 9, 3*7 is 21, 3*5 is 15, 3*8 is 24, and 3*8 is 24. Wait, that's not right because 88573 is 8 8 5 7 3. Let me write it as 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3. So, 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, yes, 3*88573 is indeed 265719, and adding 1 gives 265720. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*(265720). Let me compute 3*265720. Let's break it down: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3*265720 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 is 797161. That's 797161.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check. 265720*3: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. So, adding those up: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Yes, that's correct. So, 1 + 797160 is 797161.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next one is 1 + 3*(797161). Let me compute 3*797161. Hmm, that's going to be a huge number. Let me break it down: 700000*3 is 2,100,000, 90,000*3 is 270,000, 7,000*3 is 21,000, 100*3 is 300, 60*3 is 180, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 is 2,370,000, plus 21,000 is 2,391,000, plus 300 is 2,391,300, plus 180 is 2,391,480, plus 3 is 2,391,483. So, 3*797161 is 2,391,483. Then, 1 + 2,391,483 is 2,391,484. That's 2,391,484.\n\nWait, let me verify that again because that's a big number. 797,161 * 3: 700,000*3 is 2,100,000, 90,000*3 is 270,000, 7,000*3 is 21,000, 100*3 is 300, 60*3 is 180, 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 2,100,000 + 270,000 is 2,370,000, plus 21,000 is 2,391,000, plus 300 is 2,391,300, plus 180 is 2,391,480, plus 3 is 2,391,483. So, yes, that's correct. Then, 1 + 2,391,483 is 2,391,484.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next one is 1 + 3*(2,391,484). Let me compute 3*2,391,484. Let me break this down: 2,000,000*3 is 6,000,000, 300,000*3 is 900,000, 90,000*3 is 270,000, 1,000*3 is 3,000, 400*3 is 1,200, 80*3 is 240, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 6,000,000 + 900,000 is 6,900,000, plus 270,000 is 7,170,000, plus 3,000 is 7,173,000, plus 1,200 is 7,174,200, plus 240 is 7,174,440, plus 12 is 7,174,452. So, 3*2,391,484 is 7,174,452. Then, 1 + 7,174,452 is 7,174,453. That's 7,174,453.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that again because that's a massive number. 2,391,484 * 3: 2,000,000*3 is 6,000,000, 300,000*3 is 900,000, 90,000*3 is 270,000, 1,000*3 is 3,000, 400*3 is 1,200, 80*3 is 240, 4*3 is 12. Adding them: 6,000,000 + 900,000 is 6,900,000, plus 270,000 is 7,170,000, plus 3,000 is 7,173,000, plus 1,200 is 7,174,200, plus 240 is 7,174,440, plus 12 is 7,174,452. So, yes, that's correct. Then, adding 1 gives 7,174,453.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, it's 3*(7,174,453). Let me compute that. 7,000,000*3 is 21,000,000, 174,000*3 is 522,000, 453*3 is 1,359. Adding those together: 21,000,000 + 522,000 is 21,522,000, plus 1,359 is 21,523,359. So, 3*7,174,453 is 21,523,359.\n\nWait, let me verify that step by step. 7,174,453 * 3: 7,000,000*3 is 21,000,000, 100,000*3 is 300,000, 70,000*3 is 210,000, 4,000*3 is 12,000, 400*3 is 1,200, 50*3 is 150, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 21,000,000 + 300,000 is 21,300,000, plus 210,000 is 21,510,000, plus 12,000 is 21,522,000, plus 1,200 is 21,523,200, plus 150 is 21,523,350, plus 9 is 21,523,359. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outwards, each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Each time, the numbers got significantly larger, but by breaking them down step by step, I was able to compute each layer accurately. The final result after multiplying the outermost layer by 3 is 21,523,359.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me recount the layers. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? Let me count them: starting from the innermost (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, counting the opening parentheses, there are nine sets. So, I should have done nine steps of computation. Let me check how many steps I took.\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nWait, hold on, that's only nine steps, but when I computed earlier, I went up to 7,174,453 and then multiplied by 3. Hmm, maybe I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me see. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). There are nine opening parentheses, so that would mean nine layers. So, my initial computation was correct, with nine layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I had 1+3(...), which was the first step, then the second step, etc., up to nine steps. So, perhaps I miscounted when I was writing down the steps. Let me recount.\n\n1. Start with (1+3) = 4\n2. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Then, 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Then, 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Then, 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. Then, 1 + 3*265720 = 797161\n13. Then, 1 + 3*797161 = 2,391,484\n14. Then, 1 + 3*2,391,484 = 7,174,453\n15. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*7,174,453 = 21,523,359\n\nWait, now I'm confused because I thought there were nine layers, but in this recount, I have 15 steps. That can't be right. Wait, no, perhaps I miscounted. Let me look at the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n...\nUp to how many? Let me see: each opening parenthesis after the initial 3(...) is a new layer. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there are nine instances of (1+3(...)) before we get to the outermost 3(...). So, that would mean that after computing the innermost (1+3) = 4, we have nine layers to compute, each time doing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be nine steps, right? So, let me try to recount.\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, that's only ten steps. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by going further out, but actually, the original expression only has nine layers inside the initial 3(...). So, perhaps I overcounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression more carefully. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), so each layer adds one more (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, the expression has nine (1+3) layers inside the initial 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, we get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524 is 88572, and then adding 1? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because in the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, after the ninth layer, we have 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside the 3(...). So, the innermost is (1+3) = 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after nine layers, we have a result, say R9, and then the entire expression is 3*R9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is (1+3) = 4, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, after nine layers, we have R9 = 1 + 3*R8, where R8 is the result from the previous layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define Rn as the result after n layers. So, R1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, R2 = 1 + 3*R1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. R3 = 1 + 3*R2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. R4 = 1 + 3*R3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. R5 = 1 + 3*R4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. R6 = 1 + 3*R5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. R7 = 1 + 3*R6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. R8 = 1 + 3*R7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. R9 = 1 + 3*R8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*R9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems different from what I had before. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by considering an extra layer. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the original expression, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers inside the 3(...). So, R1 is the innermost (1+3) = 4. Then, R2 = 1 + 3*R1 = 13. R3 = 1 + 3*R2 = 40. R4 = 1 + 3*R3 = 121. R5 = 1 + 3*R4 = 364. R6 = 1 + 3*R5 = 1093. R7 = 1 + 3*R6 = 3280. R8 = 1 + 3*R7 = 9841. R9 = 1 + 3*R8 = 29524. Then, the outermost operation is 3*R9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I had gone up to 21,523,359, which was much larger. So, clearly, I made a mistake in the number of layers I considered. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nI think the confusion arises from how the expression is structured. Let me write the expression with indices to clarify. Let me denote each nested expression as follows:\n\nLet me define E1 = (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's nine layers inside the initial 3(...). So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I had computed up to 21,523,359, which was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct approach is to compute nine layers, each time doing 1 + 3*previous result, and then multiply the ninth result by 3.\n\nSo, let me redo the steps correctly:\n\n1. E1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n2. E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. E9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had nine layers, but when I first started computing, I went up to 7,174,453, which was incorrect because I had miscounted the layers. So, the correct number of layers is nine, leading to 88572 as the final result.\n\nWait, to make sure, let me compute E9 again:\n\nE1 = 4\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think earlier I miscounted the layers, thinking there were more, which led me to compute beyond the correct number of layers. So, the correct approach is to compute nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*previous result, and then multiply the ninth result by 3 to get the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\nStarting with the innermost expression and working outward, each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing all nine layers, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3 * 4 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3 * 13 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3 * 40 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3 * 121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3 * 364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3 * 1093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3 * 3280 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3 * 9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the ninth layer's result by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That might be the easiest way to tackle this. Let me write it down step by step to visualize it better.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part: 1+3. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, replacing the innermost parentheses, I can rewrite the expression as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\n\nWait, that might not be the best way to approach it. Maybe I should label each layer so I don't get confused. Let me assign each parentheses a level, starting from the innermost as level 1 and moving outwards.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1 result) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Let me confirm that. Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left, each opening parenthesis is followed by a 1 + 3(...). Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is the last (1+3), and each step out adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times 1+3 is nested:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3) \u2013 that's one layer.\n\n2. Then it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1: 1 + 3*(1+3) \u2013 that's two layers.\n\n3. Then again, 1 + 3*(previous result) \u2013 that's three layers.\n\nContinuing this way, I think there are nine layers in total because each time you go one step out, you add another layer. So, starting from the innermost, I need to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list each level and compute it:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Level 9. So, after computing Level 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that step by step. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60, so 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\nFinally, 4 * 3 = 12, so 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with larger numbers.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels. Let me recount the levels because sometimes it's easy to miscount the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each level builds on the previous one, and the final result after multiplying by 3 is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or check with a different approach. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or some recursive formula.\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n\nAt each level n, the value is 1 + 3*(value at level n-1)\n\nSo, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), starting with a(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a(n). The general solution for such a recurrence is a(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\na(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1)\n\nAssuming a solution of the form a(n) = C*3^n + D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^(n-1) + D)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*C*3^(n-1) + 3D\n\n= 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a(n) = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a(1) = 4.\n\na(1) = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for level n, a(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, that formula works perfectly. So, at level 9, a(9)=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3 each time, so the total sum would be a geometric series with ratio 3. But in this case, since each layer is dependent on the previous one, it's more efficient to model it as a recurrence relation.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to expand the expression step by step, but that might be more time-consuming. Let me try expanding a few layers to see if it aligns with the previous results.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 =13\n\nLevel 3:1 + 3*(13)=1 +39=40\n\nLevel 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLevel 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLevel 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLevel 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLevel 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLevel 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the previous method. So, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work in multiple ways. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each level up to the ninth, the final result is obtained by multiplying by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outwards. Let me try to write this out step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me rewrite the problem to make it clearer. The innermost part is 1+3, right? So let's start there. Let me denote each level as a step:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3.\n\nStep 2: Then move one level out and compute the next parentheses, which would be 1 + 3*(result from Step 1).\n\nStep 3: Continue this process, each time working from the inside out, until I reach the outermost parentheses.\n\nSo, let's start.\n\nStep 1: Compute 1 + 3.\n\nThat's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, the innermost parentheses simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's do that.\n\nStep 2: Compute 1 + 3*(4).\n\nFirst, compute 3*4, which is 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo now, the next level simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another level, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(13).\n\nStep 3: Compute 1 + 3*(13).\n\n3*13 is 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, that level simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, let's go another level out.\n\nStep 4: Compute 1 + 3*(40).\n\n3*40 is 120. Adding 1: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nSo, now we have 121 at this level.\n\nNext level out.\n\nStep 5: Compute 1 + 3*(121).\n\n3*121: Let me calculate that. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then add 1: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nSo, this level is 364.\n\nMoving out another level.\n\nStep 6: Compute 1 + 3*(364).\n\n3*364: Let me break that down. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nSo, this level is 1093.\n\nNext level out.\n\nStep 7: Compute 1 + 3*(1093).\n\n3*1093: Hmm, let's compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nSo, this level is 3280.\n\nMoving out another level.\n\nStep 8: Compute 1 + 3*(3280).\n\n3*3280: Let me calculate this. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nSo, this level is 9841.\n\nNext level out.\n\nStep 9: Compute 1 + 3*(9841).\n\n3*9841: Let's break this down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, this level is 29524.\n\nFinally, moving out to the outermost parentheses.\n\nStep 10: Compute 3*(29524).\n\nWait, no, actually, let me check the original problem again. The entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the result of all those parentheses. So after computing the innermost part, each step adds a layer, and after 9 layers, we get to the outermost parentheses. So, actually, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. Let me make sure I'm counting the steps correctly.\n\nWait, let me recount. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3,\n\nthen 1+3*(that),\n\nthen 1+3*(that result),\n\nand so on, until we have 9 layers of 1+3*(...).\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a layer, and each subsequent layer is 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3,\n\nthen 1+3*(...),\n\nand each time, the number of layers increases by one. Let's see:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\n8. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\n9. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1+3*(...). Therefore, when I did my steps earlier, I went through 9 steps, each time computing the next level out. So, after step 9, I had 29524, which is the result of the innermost 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, step 10 would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went up to step 9 where I got 29524, which is the result of the innermost 9 layers. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, let me compute that.\n\nCompute 3*29524.\n\nLet me calculate that. 29524 * 3.\n\nI can break this down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\nThen, 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: 1+3=4\n\nStep 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nStep 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nStep 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nStep 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nStep 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nStep 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nStep 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nStep 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572\n\nWait, but let me check step 9 again: 3*9841.\n\nIs 3*9841 equal to 29,523?\n\nLet me compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n800 * 3 = 2,400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524: Let's confirm that.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each step manually? Maybe a geometric series or something like that.\n\nLooking at the expression: Each step is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me denote each term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the recursion: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence into the general solution.\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9,\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each step manually or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nThen, 29524*3=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each a_n follows a geometric progression with ratio 3, offset by the constant term 1. The closed-form solution confirms that.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each level as a step, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1.

Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So that layer is 1093. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. That's the next layer. Now, moving out another step, it's 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So that's 9841. Next layer out is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So that layer is 29524. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9524 is... Hmm, wait, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*524 is 1572, so 27000 + 1572 is 28572. So 60000 + 28572 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So that's 88573. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573: 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8573 is... Let me compute 3*8000 is 24000, 3*573 is 1719. So 24000 + 1719 is 25719. Then, adding that to 240000: 240000 + 25719 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. So the entire inner expression simplifies to 265720. Now, the original problem is 3 times this result. So, 3 * 265720. Let me compute that: 3*200000 is 600000, 3*65720 is... Wait, maybe it's easier to just multiply 265720 by 3 directly. 265720 * 3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Wait, no, actually, 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20. Wait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think again: 265720 is 200000 + 60000 + 5000 + 700 + 20? Wait, 200000 + 60000 is 260000, plus 5000 is 265000, plus 700 is 265700, plus 20 is 265720. Yes. So, 3*200000=600000, 3*60000=180000, 3*5000=15000, 3*700=2100, 3*20=60. Now, adding all those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3 times 265720 is 797160. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 797160. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through the steps to make sure. Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1+3)=4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Then, 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Next, 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Then, 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364. Next, 1 + 3*364=1 +1092=1093. Then, 1 + 3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Next, 1 + 3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Then, 1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Next, 1 + 3*29524=1 +88572=88573. Then, 1 + 3*88573=1 +265719=265720. Finally, 3*265720=797160. Hmm, that seems consistent. But maybe I should check one of the layers again to be sure. Let me take the layer where it's 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That's correct. Then 1 + 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Then 1 + 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, total 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Then 1 + 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, total 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 1 + 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9524=28572, total 88572, plus 1 is 88573. Correct. Then 1 + 3*88573: 3*80000=240000, 3*8573=25719, total 265719, plus 1 is 265720. Correct. Finally, 3*265720: 265720*3. Let me compute 265720 * 3 another way. 265720 * 3: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 = 795000, plus 2100 = 797100, plus 60 = 797160. Yes, that's correct. So, after carefully checking each step, I'm confident that the final result is 797160.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing 1 + 3 times the result of the next innermost expression. After simplifying each layer, the final result is found by multiplying the outermost result by 3.\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) = 797160$\n\n$\\boxed{797160}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can solve it by working from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works with nested expressions. So, let's try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, that part is easy. Now, moving one layer out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Let me write down each step as I go:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but let me count the number of layers to make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and each is multiplied by 3 except the innermost one. Let me count how many times the 3 is multiplied. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Then 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Then 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Then 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Then 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Then 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Then 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Then 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers inside, and then the outermost 3 times that. So, 10 layers in total? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each is multiplied by 3 in the next layer. Let me count the number of \"1+3(...)\" sections.\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3*(...)\n3. 1 + 3*(...)\n4. 1 + 3*(...)\n5. 1 + 3*(...)\n6. 1 + 3*(...)\n7. 1 + 3*(...)\n8. 1 + 3*(...)\n9. 1 + 3*(...)\n10. Then, the outermost 3*(...)\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers of \"1 + 3*(...)\" and then the outermost 3. So, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write down each step with the correct number of layers. Let me try to count the number of times I have to compute \"1 + 3*(...)\".\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, inside the parentheses, it's 1 + 3*(...). Let me count how many such terms there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving out, the next term is 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost layer is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the 3 is multiplied by the entire inner expression. So, perhaps I have 9 layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(result). So, in total, I compute 9 inner expressions, each time building up the value, and then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the count. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" occurs:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving out, 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Then, 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Then, 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Then, 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Then, 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Then, 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Then, 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the 3 is multiplied by the entire inner expression, which includes 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps my initial count was correct, and I have 9 layers inside, each time computing 1 + 3*(result), and then finally multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, but when I count the number of times I have to compute \"1 + 3*(...)\", it's 9 times, each time building up the value, and then the outermost 3 is multiplied by that final value. So, let me try to compute each step carefully.\n\nLet me write down each step with the corresponding computation:\n\n1. Compute innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers inside, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and then the outermost 3 times that. So, the final result would be 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524. Hmm, let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nWait, but that might not be the most efficient way. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, but that seems off because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check with another method to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps, because that would throw off the entire calculation.\n\nLet me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. Finally, 3*(29524) = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, each step checks out, and the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each time, the expression is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result from the inner expression. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me think about it as a recurrence. Let me define a sequence where a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, starting from a_0 = 1. But in this problem, the innermost is (1 + 3), so maybe a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on.\n\nWait, but in this case, we have 9 layers inside, so a_9 would be the value before the outermost multiplication by 3. Then, the total expression would be 3*a_9.\n\nLet me try to compute a few terms to see if there's a pattern or a formula.\n\nGiven a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_0 = 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost is a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1, so perhaps a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_k.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_0 = 1.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When k = 0, a_0 = 1.\n\nSo, 1 = A*3^0 + (-1/2) => 1 = A*1 - 1/2 => A = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor k = 0: a_0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk = 1: a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk = 5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk = 6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk = 7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk = 8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that formula works perfectly. So, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is a_9 = 29524.\n\nThus, the total expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula directly without computing each step.\n\nSince a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049; 3^11 = 177147.\n\nThus, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572.\n\nThat's the same result again, so that must be correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, using a recurrence relation formula, and computing directly using exponents. All methods give the same result. So, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and working my way up. Let me try to write this out step by step.\n\nStarting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, (1+3) is 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Since the previous result was 4, this would be (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that.\n\n3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next layer out is 13. Now, moving one more layer out, we have another (1 + 3*(previous result)), which is (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that.\n\n3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and that gives the next result. Let me see if this pattern continues.\n\nNext layer out: (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, so that's 121. Moving out another layer: (1 + 3*121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, 364.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is (1 + 3*364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*1093). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*3280). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm keeping track correctly. So far, I've computed:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nWait, but the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count them. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. Let me recount the steps I did earlier:\n\n1. 1+3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = ?\n\nWait, so I think I might have missed one step. Because when I did 8 steps, I only went up to 9841, but I think I need to do one more step because the original expression has 9 layers. Let me check that.\n\nWait, no, actually, the original expression starts with 3 times (1 + 3 times ( ... )). So, the innermost part is (1+3), which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, the total number of layers is 9. So, starting from the innermost, we have:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = ?\n\nWait, so in my earlier calculation, I stopped at Layer 8, which was 9841. But I think I need to go one more layer out to Layer 9, which would be 1 + 3*9841.\n\nSo, let's compute that:\n\n3*9841 = 29,523\n\nThen, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nNow, after computing Layer 9, which is 29,524, the entire expression is 3 times that, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the entire nested expression, which after computing all layers, we get 29,524.\n\nSo, the final step is to compute 3*29,524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29,524 * 3.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (20,000 * 3) + (9,000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3)\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524:\n\nLet me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 9 again because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers. So, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, I think I did 9 layers correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a different method, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, starting from a_1 = 4,\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13,\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40,\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121,\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364,\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093,\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280,\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841,\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a geometric series or something similar here. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since this is a finite number of terms, maybe it's easier to compute each step as I did before.\n\nBut just to explore, the homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms the earlier calculation. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations when applying the formula. For n=9, 3^{10} is 59,049, right?\n\nYes, 3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59,049.\n\nThen, (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've considered this problem from multiple angles: step-by-step computation, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, solving the recurrence relation, and verifying with the formula. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm pretty sure that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5.

Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost part: (1 + 3) = 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))$\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I messed up the counting. Let me count how many times the (1 + 3) occurs. Let me see: Each time, the expression is 3 times something, and inside that something, there's another (1 + 3(...)). So perhaps it's a repeating pattern. Maybe I can approach this by working from the inside out, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as a step. Let's number the innermost parentheses as step 1, then moving outward as step 2, step 3, etc., up to step 9, since I can see there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)).\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of times the innermost (1 + 3) occurs. Let me parse the expression:\n\nStarting from the right, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then each step out adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, perhaps there are 9 layers here. Let me confirm:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, perhaps it's 9 layers. Let me try to compute each step.\n\nLet me start from the innermost layer, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next layer would be 3 times that result, plus 1. So, let me see:\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Each layer is of the form (1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nAt step 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(step1)). Let me compute that.\n\nStep 2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. If step1 is 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Yes, that's right.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, step3 would be (1 + 3*(step2)).\n\nSo, step3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me continue this way.\n\nStep4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay.\n\nStep5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so that's the innermost to the 9th layer. But wait, let me check: the original expression is 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the result of the 9th layer.\n\nSo, after computing step9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that calculation:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, it's 88572.\n\nSo, the total expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form (1 + 3n), where n is the result from the previous layer. So, each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). So, starting from n1 = 4, then n2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to n9, then the final result is 3*n9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this recurrence relation. Let me see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_k = C*3^{k} + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me substitute into the recurrence:\n\na_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}.\n\nUsing the general solution:\n\nC*3^{k} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{k-1} + D).\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*C*3^{k-1} + 3*D\n\n= 1 + C*3^{k} + 3D.\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nC*3^{k} + D = 1 + C*3^{k} + 3D.\n\nSubtract C*3^{k} from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D.\n\nNow, solve for D:\n\nD - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_k = C*3^{k} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1 = 4.\n\nWhen k = 1, a1 = 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSo, 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo, C = (9/2) / 3 = (9/2) * (1/3) = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for k = 9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_k is built by multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1. So, when I expand the entire expression, it's a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the innermost expression and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, I'm noticing that each step is similar to 3^{n} + something. Let me see if I can express a_k as (3^{k} - 1)/2. Wait, for k=1, a1=4, which is (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct.\n\nFor k=2, a2=13, which is (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct.\n\nSimilarly, a3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, indeed, a_k=(3^{k+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to notice that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try expanding the entire expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me denote the innermost (1 + 3) as S1, then the next layer as S2, and so on up to S9, then the outermost is 3*S9.\n\nAs we've computed, S1=4, S2=13, S3=40, S4=121, S5=364, S6=1093, S7=3280, S8=9841, S9=29524.\n\nSo, 3*S9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's see: Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, when we expand the entire expression, each step contributes a power of 3.\n\nWait, let me try to expand the entire expression step by step, without substituting each step's value.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nExpression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me work from the inside out:\n\nFirst, compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13=39.\n\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me try to see how many 3's are multiplied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent the entire expression as a sum. Let me try to expand it:\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me compute E step by step, working from the innermost parentheses.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out: (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with all previous methods.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few more steps manually.\n\nLet me compute a few steps again:\n\nStep1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if 3^10 is 59049, as I thought earlier.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, correct. So, a9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same answer: 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.
