    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Calculating that, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). That would be 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, then plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3280*3 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9841*3 is... Hmm, let's see. 9000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400; 29,400 + 120 is 29,520; 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. So, 3*9841 is 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29,524. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...), where ... is Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29,524. Let me calculate that: 29,524*3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3 is 60,000; 9,000*3 is 27,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 20*3 is 60; and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500; 88,500 + 60 is 88,560; 88,560 + 12 is 88,572. So, 3*29,524 equals 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, hold on, earlier I wrote 1093 as Layer 6, but now I'm writing 1,093. That's the same number, just with a comma for clarity. So, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify the last multiplication again because sometimes that's where errors can creep in. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3 is 60,000; 9,000*3 is 27,000; 500*3 is 1,500; 20*3 is 60; 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that checks out. So, I think my answer is correct. The key here was to break down the problem into smaller, manageable layers, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. Each layer was a simple computation of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. By systematically computing each layer one by one, I was able to avoid getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the nested expressions. It's a good strategy for problems like this where the structure repeats itself multiple times. So, in summary, the steps were: 1. Identify the nested structure and recognize the repeating pattern. 2. Start computing from the innermost parentheses and move outward. 3. For each layer, compute 1 + 3*(previous layer's result). 4. Once all layers are computed, multiply the outermost result by 3. 5. Double-check each step to ensure accuracy. This method worked well, and I didn't encounter any issues along the way. It just required careful step-by-step computation and attention to detail to avoid arithmetic errors. So, I feel confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing all layers, the final result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Then, moving outward, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me write this down as a formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, if I can compute each layer step by step, I can build up to the outermost layer, which will give me the value inside the first set of parentheses, and then I can multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me proceed step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, so Layer 9 is 29524. But the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the outermost part is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext, 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\nThen, 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext, 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nFinally, 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an error when multiplying large numbers.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me check that again: 364 * 3 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841 * 3: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, multiplying that by 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88572. Yep, that matches what I got earlier. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Each layer was computed correctly, starting from the innermost, and each time I substituted the previous layer's value into the next. Then, after computing the ninth layer, I multiplied by 3 to get the final result.

    "text": ". That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Plugging in Layer 2's value: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each layer is growing quite a bit. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 29,000 * 3 = 87,000. 524 * 3 = 1,572. Adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. But wait, let me verify the multiplication step again to be thorough. 29524 * 3: Let's do it digit by digit. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27. 8 * 3 = 24. 2 * 3 = 6. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula that could represent this nested expression, so I can compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n represent the value at each layer, starting from the innermost as a_1, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's assume a solution of the form a_n = C*3^{n} + D. Plugging into the recurrence: C*3^{n} + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) = 1 + C*3^{n} + 3D. So, simplifying: C*3^{n} + D = C*3^{n} + 1 + 3D. Subtract C*3^{n} from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me recount. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Wait, actually, when I labeled them earlier, I had Layer 1 as the innermost, which was 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer added another 3*(...). So, if there are nine layers, then the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1 =3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another set. Let's count them: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the first 3, there are 9 more layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, total layers including the innermost one would be 9. Wait, no. Actually, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent addition is another layer. So, in the expression, after the first 3, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(...)\", which would correspond to 9 layers. Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had a_1 to a_9, which was 9 layers, so the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 =177144. Divided by 2 is 88,572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or directly compute using the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final result of 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident with this result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

    "text": ". Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = let's see, 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, maybe breaking it down digit by digit would be better. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carried) = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carried) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carried) = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I broke it down before, I thought 29524 * 3 is 88572, but let me verify:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with so many layers.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so maybe it's a geometric progression.\n\nLooking at the innermost expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApply the initial condition: a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the initial terms.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works.\n\nSo, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the recurrence approach confirms the result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, we multiply the outermost layer by 3 to obtain the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers**:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't skip any layers. The original expression had nine sets of parentheses, each adding another layer. So, I computed Layer 1 through Layer 9 correctly, right? Let me recount. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, if there are nine layers, I should have nine computations. Wait, actually, the expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are eight more layers, making it nine in total.

    "text": ". Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving outward, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 29524, we have 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.

Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3. Let me break that down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, and 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, and 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, another way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is following a pattern. Let me see if I can find a formula or a pattern here. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. And so on. So, each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n, which would make computing it for n=9 easier. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's homogeneous with constant coefficients. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula holds for all layers up to n=9. Therefore, using this formula, I can compute L_9 directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That would have saved time, especially if the expression were longer. Now, the original expression is 3*(L_9). So, using L_9 =29524, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier calculation. Alternatively, I can express the entire computation using the formula. Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11} first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before. So, whether I compute it step by step, using the recurrence relation, or using the formula derived from the recurrence, I end up with the same answer: 88572. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern and deriving a formula can make solving such problems more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. In this case, since there were only nine layers, step-by-step computation was manageable, but for more layers, the formula would be much more practical. I think I've got this problem figured out correctly. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. I started by computing each layer from the innermost outwards, which worked well. Then, I noticed the recurrence relation and derived a general formula for each layer, which allowed me to compute the outermost layer directly. Finally, I multiplied that result by 3 to get the final answer. All my calculations checked out, and both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by recognizing a repeating pattern. Each layer follows the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, we compute each layer until we reach the outermost one. Using a recurrence relation, we find a general formula for each layer, allowing us to compute the result efficiently. The final value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The structure of the expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as follows: Let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, but since I didn't think of it initially, breaking it down layer by layer was a good approach. It's always good to verify the result using a different method to ensure accuracy, especially when dealing with repetitive calculations that are prone to arithmetic errors. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recursive formula. Solving this recursion gives us a closed-form expression, which confirms the result when computed layer by layer.\n\nThe final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; adding them: 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; adding up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, each step seems correct.

Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me see if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). That seems like a geometric sequence, maybe? Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. If I let the entire innermost expression be x, then each layer is 1 + 3x, but since it's nested, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, perhaps there's a way to express this as a sum. But given that I've already solved it step by step and also using the recurrence relation, and both gave me the same result, I think 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Now, Layer 3 is: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then each Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n = 1, L1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. So, equation (1): 3A + B = 4. Now, let's compute L2 using the recurrence: L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution, L2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, equation (2): 9A + B = 13. Now, subtract equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, plug A back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1/2). So, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier values. For n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, since we have Layer 9, which is the outermost one, let's compute that using the formula. Layer 9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 =88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, since each layer is built upon the previous one, and we can model it as a geometric series, but I think the recursive approach worked well here. So, to recap, by computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, and then using a recursive formula to find a general expression, I arrived at the solution of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Plugging in Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each time, we're multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Layer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nWait a minute, 4, 13, 40... Let me compute a few more layers to see if I can spot a pattern or a formula. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me compute that step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. This is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n=1 is the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure, let me go through the computation again quickly. L_1: 4, L_2:13, L_3:40, L_4:121, L_5:364, L_6:1093, L_7:3280, L_8:9841, L_9:29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that seems right. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, so I think the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": ". Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 is 39. So, Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Therefore, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Therefore, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make an error along the way. Let's go back through each layer to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Final multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a certain formula. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. It looks like each term is following a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, which might have a closed-form solution. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), I can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Okay, so the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.

Calculating 3*13: 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 3*100 is 300, 3*20 is 60, and 3*1 is 3. So 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Breaking it down: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up. Let me recompute Layer 9's multiplication just to be sure. Layer 9 is 29524, and 3 times that. Let me compute 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me verify each layer again. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3 again. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern I can recognize here to make this computation easier without having to compute each layer step by step, especially since this could get tedious with more layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple linear recurrence, maybe I can find a closed-form formula. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the value is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which is much faster. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the closed-form formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), we find that the innermost layer \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's do that: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9841 is... Hmm, let me break that down. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost part is 3 times the result of the innermost expression. So, we have 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Again, breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524*3: 29000*3=87000, 524*3=1572. So, 87000 + 1572 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just quickly verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations.

So, Layer 2 equals 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first: 3*10 is 30, 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then, adding 1 gives 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12, so 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, adding those up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. Adding those together: 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.

Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let me break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer, each step seems correct: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 3 times that gives 88572. I think that's right. I don't see any errors in the computations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer's value is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break that down. 29524 * 3. I can compute 29524*3 as follows: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because 29,524 * 3. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29,524\ntimes 3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using another method to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\ntimes 3\n--------\n29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88,572.\n\nSo, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I look at the original expression, it's 3(1 + 3(...)) and I have nine layers. Let me count the number of layers again to make sure I didn't miscount.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n... and so on, until the ninth layer.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs inside the parentheses.\n\nLooking at the expression, each time after the first, it's 1 + 3 followed by another parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that would mean nine layers. Therefore, my initial calculation of nine layers is correct.\n\nSo, if each layer is correct, then the final result should be 88,572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if the pattern holds.\n\nLet's take a smaller version with fewer layers, say, two layers, and see if the method works.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nFirst, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, outermost: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: three layers.\n\nCompute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))).\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nThen, outermost: 3*40 = 120.\n\nCompute directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, no, wait, in three layers, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, innermost is 4, next is 1 + 3*4=13, next is 1 + 3*13=40, then 3*40=120.\n\nWait, but when I compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))), it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(4))). So, 1 + 3*(1 + 12) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I first thought of three layers, I mistakenly thought of the result as 39, but that's incorrect. So, my method seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, applying the same method to the original problem, which has nine layers, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are getting large so quickly. Let me check another layer.\n\nFour layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))).\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nThen, 3*121 = 363.\n\nCompute directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*13)) = 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363. Correct.\n\nSo, each time, the method works, and the numbers grow exponentially, which makes sense because each layer is multiplied by 3 and then added 1.\n\nTherefore, I feel confident that my calculation up to nine layers is correct, resulting in 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try to compute the first few layers again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can conclude that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, perhaps I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this kind of nested expression, to see if there's a more efficient way to compute it without having to go through each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, it's a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a function of the previous term.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution, I arrive at the same result. That gives me even more confidence that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying with a smaller example, and even deriving a formula to compute the nth layer directly, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 364*3 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093. 3*1,093 is 3,279, so 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,280 is 9,840, so 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841. Let me compute 3*9,841: 9,841*3. Hmm, 9,000*3 is 27,000, 800*3 is 2,400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so I need to compute 3*29,524. Let me do that: 29,524*3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3 = 60,000; 9,000*3 = 27,000; 500*3 = 1,500; 20*3 = 60; 4*3 = 12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. Wait a second, that seems like a big number. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

    "text": ". Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, and 3*1 = 3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to just multiply 29524 by 3 directly. Let me do that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplication steps. Starting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. 29524*3 is indeed 88572. So, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or recognize a pattern, but since each layer is only one step, it's manageable to compute each layer step by step. It might have been possible to find a formula, but given the small number of layers (nine), it's probably faster to compute each step manually.\n\nWait, let me see if there's a pattern in the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, the recurrence relation is Layer n = 3*Layer (n-1) + 1, starting from Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and such sequences can be solved using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is Layer n - 3*Layer (n-1) = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the known layers:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and solving it with a formula, which confirms the step-by-step computation.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is essentially a geometric progression. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to the expansion of (3^{n} -1)/2, as we saw.\n\nBut since the problem only has nine layers, it's feasible to compute each step manually, as I did earlier. However, recognizing the pattern and using the formula is a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nIn conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\( \\text{Layer } n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for \\(n = 9\\), we get Layer 9 as 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\).\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\).\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\).\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\).\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\).\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\).\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\).\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   - Multiply Layer 9 by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ". That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer. Let me keep going to see if the pattern continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Well, 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, maybe breaking it down digit by digit is better. Let's see: 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 + 1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again because that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524*3:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n------------\n\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 +1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +2 =8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method: 29,524 *3. 30,000 *3=90,000. But since it's 29,524, which is 30,000 - 476. So, 90,000 - (476*3). 476*3: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200+210=1410 +18=1428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Let me check if I perhaps miscounted the layers. The original expression has nine layers of 1 +3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses: each \"1+\" is followed by a \"3(\" so let's see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first parenthesis is 3(, then inside is 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine \"1+3(\" instances, which would mean nine layers, each time adding another 1 +3*(...). So, my initial count was correct with nine layers, each being 1 +3*(previous layer). So, my computation up to Layer 9 is correct, leading to 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Let me just confirm once more by computing each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\n3*29524=88,572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in my calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the arithmetic checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus three times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3.

Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Since Layer 2 is 13, this becomes 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so Layer 3 is 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Moving outward, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Continuing, Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Moving on, Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841.

Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be multiplying the previous layer by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if this continues. Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121.

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840.

Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = let's compute 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72, so 1500 + 72 = 1572. Then, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think I did this correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches my earlier computation. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is layer 1, a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n where n increases by 1 each time. So, layer 9, which is the outermost one, would correspond to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation for Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I found before. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute the value without having to manually calculate each layer. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows for a more straightforward solution. I think I understand this problem better now. So, in summary, by breaking down the expression into layers and recognizing the recursive pattern, I was able to compute the value step by step. Additionally, by solving the recurrence relation, I found a formula that could compute the value directly without iterative calculations, which is helpful for understanding the structure of the problem more deeply.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, we have 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as follows: 29524*3 = (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000, and 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500 + 72 = 1572.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break that down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems too big. Let me check my calculations again because that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back and verify each step carefully because with so many layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360 +3=363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400=29400 + 120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that carefully. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 8 (from the ten-thousands place), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88572. Hmm, but wait, when I write down the digits as I compute them, starting from the right, it's 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Let me confirm with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3=87000, 524*3=1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 88572. But wait, that seems like a very large number. Let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). It seems like there are nine layers because each 1+3 is nested inside another 3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, my computation seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way. Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the inner layer. So, starting from n1 = 4, n2 = 1 + 3*4=13, n3=1 + 3*13=40, and so on. So, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is n_{k} = 1 + 3n_{k-1}, starting with n1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is n_k = A*3^{k} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is n_k = 3n_{k-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is n^{(h)}_k = A*3^{k}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume n^{(p)}_k = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is n_k = A*3^{k} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At k=1, n1=4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is n_k = (3/2)*3^{k} - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, n_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For k=1: n1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor k=2: n2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor k=3: n3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor k=4: n4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for k=9, n9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. So, n9=29524, which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*n9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, n9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the formula \\(n_k = \\frac{3^{k+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer \\(k=9\\), this results in 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alright, moving on to Layer 3, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so Layer 3 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each layer seems to be building up quickly. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12, so adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, Layer 6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Thus, Layer 7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, Layer 8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Therefore, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. Yep, that seems right.

So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3 times Layer 2. Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Let me check if this continues similarly. Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3. Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4. 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems to follow correctly. Let me recompute a couple of layers to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).

    "text": ". That's straightforward. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, that's Layer 2. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Plugging in Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, that's a jump. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Wow, this is increasing rapidly. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Okay, that's already over a thousand. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Wow, that's over three thousand. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. That's almost ten thousand. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Okay, so the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer. So, after computing all nine layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 times that Layer 9 value, right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. I can compute this by multiplying each digit by 3 and carrying over as needed. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that again because when I did the multiplication step by step, I think I might have messed up the place values. Let me write it out properly:\n\n      29524\n    x    3\n    -------\n      88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. I'll recount each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer's value. So, after nine layers, we get 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives us 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that makes sense. Each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is a geometric progression, but since it's nested, it's more of a recursive computation. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions, but since I already computed each layer step by step and got a consistent result, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Let me just check the multiplication one more time to be sure: 29524 * 3. 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n59048 + 29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40. Wait, 4, 13, 40... Let me compute the next few layers to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, wait a second, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, I need to multiply that by 3. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it all together, it's 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, it's 88572. Let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. So, Layer 8 was 9841, right? Then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9841*3. Let me compute that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is indeed 29524. So that part is correct. Then 3*29524: 29524*3, as I did before, is 88572. So, that seems correct. Let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous layers, because if I messed up one layer, it would throw off all the subsequent ones. Let me go through the layers again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe a formula or a pattern that could have saved me from computing each layer step by step. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). This looks like a geometric series, but nested. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is defined by that recurrence relation. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, I could compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the known values. For n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer I got by computing each layer step by step. Alternatively, using the formula, I can compute a_9 directly as 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Either way, the result is the same. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step.

    "text": ". Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120, and 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Breaking it down: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As before, 3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and each step built upon the previous one correctly. So, yeah, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.
