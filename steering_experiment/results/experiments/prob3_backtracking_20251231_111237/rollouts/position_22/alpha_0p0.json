    "text": " Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's break it down. 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here, especially since each layer is a repetition of the same operation. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have a recurrence relation here. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think that makes sense. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach also led me to the same answer. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which simplifies the computation. Applying this formula to the outermost layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Formula**: Using the recurrence relation, the nth layer can be expressed as \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For Layer 9, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Okay, that was simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the original problem is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 24 * 3 = 72, write down 2, carry over 7. 52 * 3 = 156, plus 7 is 163. Write down 3, carry over 16. 95 * 3 = 285, plus 16 is 301. Write down 1, carry over 30. 29 * 3 = 87, plus 30 is 117. So, writing it all together, we get 88,572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the multiplication. Alternatively, I can do it step by step: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, that seems off because 29,524 * 3 should be 88,572? Let me verify with another method. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 + 29,524. Let's add them up: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 + 29,524. Adding 59,048 + 29,524: 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 4 + 2 = 6 +1=7. 0 + 5=5. 9 +9=18, write down 8, carry over 1. 5 +2=7 +1=8. So, it's 88,572. Okay, so that seems correct. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I started from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3. Each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which seems consistent. I also double-checked the final multiplication to ensure accuracy. I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the final result by 3 to get the answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2: 13 Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. Wait, 9841 is actually 9000 + 841, right? So, 3*9841 would be 3*(9000 + 841) = 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*524=1572. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify that I did each step correctly because that's a lot of computations. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and maybe I can solve it using the method for such recursions. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = A*r^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let me try to find the particular solution. If a_n = k, then k = 1 + 3*k. Solving for k: k = 1 + 3k => -2k = 1 => k = -1/2. Hmm, that's a negative number, but all our layers are positive. Maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can solve the recurrence relation step by step. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms to see if there's a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as I computed earlier. Now, I can see that each term is growing exponentially, which makes sense because of the multiplication by 3 each time. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the value. I think that's solid because both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give me the same result. It's always good to cross-verify, especially with such a lengthy expression. I don't think I made any calculation errors because each step built upon the previous one correctly, and the formula confirmed the result. So, yeah, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3*29,524. As I calculated earlier, that's 88,572. Let me check that multiplication again: 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final result of 88,572. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct.

Then 3*29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.

Let's continue. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer's value is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This seems to follow a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since each term is built upon the previous one with multiplication and addition, it's more like a recursive sequence. I wonder if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. If I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers, it's similar to a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a + b*previous term. In this case, a is 1 and b is 3. The general formula for such a nested expression with n layers can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but I need to recall how that works. Let me try to derive it. Let\u2019s denote S_n as the value after n layers. So, S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 S_3 = 1 + 3*S_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, as I computed earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation of the form S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, I can use the method for solving linear recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is S_n - 3*S_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is S_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution S_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence relation: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is S_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition S_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches S_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches S_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n layers, S_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of times the pattern 1+3(...) repeats. Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a layer. Let's see: The innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, each time we add another layer. How many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\nLayer 2: (1+3(...))\n...\nWait, actually, when I look at the expression, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)), each nested within the previous one. Therefore, n=9. Therefore, S_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, S_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when I computed each layer step by step. Therefore, the value inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify this once more to be sure. If I compute each layer step by step: Layer1:1+3=4 Layer2:1+3*4=13 Layer3:1+3*13=40 Layer4:1+3*40=121 Layer5:1+3*121=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula, n=9, S_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of the form 1 + 3(...). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term.

Multiplying this by the outermost factor of 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 2, which is 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Continuing this way, Layer 4 would be 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3*40 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, then 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 first. 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, step-by-step computation seems manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern in the numbers I got for each layer: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, each term seems to be multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. So, each layer is 3*previous + 1. That makes sense because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but in this case, since each layer is built upon the previous one, the step-by-step approach was straightforward. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression.

Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 841*3 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Let me just verify each step quickly to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, yes. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, right. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, right. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572, yes, that seems right. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Wait a second, that's 121. That seems familiar\u2014it's 11 squared. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Hmm, 364 is 4*91 or something else. Not sure if it's a perfect square or anything. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Wait, 9841\u2014is that a square number? Let me check: 99 squared is 9801, 100 squared is 10000, so 99.2^2 would be around 9840.64, which is close but not exact. So, maybe not a perfect square. Hmm. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572, so total is 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication because 29524 times 3. Let's do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 88572. Yeah, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, after checking each step, I think that's correct. But let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, I can compute a_9 using the recurrence relation. Let me compute a_1 through a_9 again to make sure. a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. So, the same as before. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since it's a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. In this case, c=1, r=3. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + d, where d is a constant particular solution. Let me find d. Assume a particular solution d, then substituting into the recurrence: d = 1 + 3*d. Solving for d: d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. Hmm, but that seems odd because all our a_n are positive integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best here, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, we can express it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say d. Substituting into the recurrence: d = 3*d + 1. Solving for d: d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the original expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is correct. Alternatively, if I didn't recognize the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1 each time, which is similar to how numbers are built in a ternary (base-3) system, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, which is exactly the recurrence relation we have. So, using the formula we derived, it's straightforward to compute a_9 and then multiply by 3. Therefore, I'm pretty sure that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me see if I can find a pattern here or perhaps a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let's list out the layers as I compute them:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: ?\nWait, let me compute Layer 4 to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute that:\n\nTotal = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWait, let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait a minute, let me verify my calculations because that seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nNow, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check the multiplication again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carry 1\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about that.\n\nIf we let a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then we can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 (correct)\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 (correct)\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 (correct)\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 (correct)\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 (correct)\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 (correct)\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 (correct)\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 (correct)\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 (correct)\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The expression given in the problem has nine layers, each being 1 + 3(...). So, does that mean n=9? Let me confirm:\n\nYes, the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, with nine layers, n=9 in the formula.\n\nThus, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me compute the expression step by step again without using the formula, just to ensure that each layer is correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is being multiplied by 3 each time, and there's an addition of 1. But since it's nested, the formula approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence, as I did before, and the solution is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. It's a bit tedious, but breaking it down step by step and verifying each layer helps prevent mistakes. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I believe the final result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost term is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers, leading to the outermost layer being 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let me break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Wait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 41*3=123. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Finally, 3*29524. Let's compute 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 72 = 88572. That seems correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Next layer: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so Layer 3 is 40. Moving outward: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Let's calculate 3*40: that's 120. So, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the final result is 88,572.

So, writing it down: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So the result is 88572. Yep, that matches my earlier calculation. So, after working through each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, I arrived at the final result of 88,572. I think that's the correct answer.

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.

Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 * 3. Let's break it down: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Layer 3 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Plugging in Layer 2's value: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting, each layer is getting bigger. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.

So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers isn't too large (only nine), computing each step was manageable. I don't recall a specific formula for this kind of nested expression, so the step-by-step approach was the way to go. Another way to think about it is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is just plugging into this formula. It's like a recursive relation where each term depends on the next. If I were to write it as a recurrence relation, it might look like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, with a_9 being the innermost term. But since we're working from the innermost out, it's more straightforward to compute each layer step by step as I did earlier.

    "text": " Okay, that's straightforward. So Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 So Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 equals 40. Continuing this way: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*(Layer 9). Let me do that: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 24 * 3 = 72. Wait, but that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 more carefully: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. So, reading the digits from bottom up: 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me try a different approach. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add step by step. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Okay, so that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f So, each layer checks out. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model it with a formula. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost layer is layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9). So, let's compute L_9 first using the formula. L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 =88572, which matches what I got earlier. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations with the exponents. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, and 3^10 is 59049. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3 each time, the total expression might be a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I consider the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) But actually, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, so maybe it's better to think of it as a sum of terms. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. Wait, using the formula for a geometric series: S = a*(r^n -1)/(r-1), where a is the first term, r is the ratio, and n is the number of terms. But in this case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is a bit different because each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. So, maybe it's better to stick with the recurrence relation approach. But since I already have the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and I verified it with the first few layers, I can be confident that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360, plus 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, plus 240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the layers again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, I think my calculation is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could simplify this without computing each layer. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's see: The recursive formula is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition: Layer 1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for n=0, if we consider Layer 0, it would be 1 + 3*Layer(-1), but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I can solve for A and B using the first few terms. Let me see: For n=1: 4 = 3A + B.\n\nFor n=2: Layer 2 = 1 + 3*Layer 1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo, now I have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, plug A = 3/2 into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the formula applies correctly here. Because in the original expression, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3, so the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that would be 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think about it.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with eight more layers inside. Wait, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can express E in terms of itself, but since each layer is similar, maybe I can find a recursive formula for E.\n\nWait, but in this case, E is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer 8, and so on. So, maybe using the formula I found earlier is more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a geometric series here. Let me see.\n\nLooking back, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))), with nine layers, then perhaps I can model it as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach time, we have 1 + 3*something, which is similar to the layers I computed before. So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But I'm not sure if that's the case here because each term is not just multiplied by 3, but it's 1 plus 3 times the next term.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a sum where each term is 3^k, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but I think the approach I took before is more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, I've computed each layer step by step, and using the formula, I arrived at the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3.\n\nMultiply 29524 by 3 digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows the pattern Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.

Alternatively, I can notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, starting from n=3, each layer is 1 + 3n. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually.

But maybe I can find a pattern in the numbers.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 = 13\n\na3 = 40\n\na4 = 121\n\na5 = 364\n\na6 = 1093\n\na7 = 3280\n\na8 = 9841\n\na9 = 29524\n\nI notice that each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nI can write this as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the outermost layer, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the calculations by computing each layer step by step again to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute this again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n8*3=24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 27 + carryover 2? Wait, no, wait.

Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.

Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841.

    "text": " Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, that's 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Wait, that's a big jump. Let me check that again. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yeah, that's correct. Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3 times Layer 3. So Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364 first. 364 times 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1093. So Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3280. So Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Add 1: 9841. So Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29524. So Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So the final result is 88572. Wait a second, that seems quite large.

    "text": " Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 93*3 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 41*3 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). That seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a general formula for the nth term. Let's see. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, these numbers look familiar. 4, 13, 40, 121... Wait a second, 4 is 4, 13 is 13, 40 is 40, 121 is 11 squared, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, I wonder if there's a pattern here. Let me see: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Let me check the ratio between successive terms. 13 / 4 = 3.25. 40 / 13 \u2248 3.077. 121 / 40 \u2248 3.025. 364 / 121 \u2248 3.008. 1093 / 364 \u2248 3.000. 3280 / 1093 \u2248 3.000. 9841 / 3280 \u2248 3.000. 29524 / 9841 \u2248 3.000. So, it seems like each term is approximately 3 times the previous term, approaching 3 as n increases. That makes sense because each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so as a_{n-1} grows, the 1 becomes negligible, and a_n \u2248 3*a_{n-1}. So, maybe for large n, a_n \u2248 3^{n}. But in our case, n is 9, so a_9 \u2248 3^9, but let's compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. Wait, but a_9 is 29524, which is more than 3^9. So, that suggests that the growth is slightly more than 3^n. Alternatively, maybe a_n can be expressed as (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe another formula. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = 2*3^{n} - something. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 =4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3,... up to a_9. Wait, but in our case, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9), right? Because the expression is 3*(a_9). So, let's compute a_9 first using the formula. a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer we got earlier. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. I think that's solid. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula approach also led me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364*3. Hmm, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.

So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Let me see if this continues.

Each layer's result was used correctly in the next one. I didn't see any arithmetic errors in my calculations. So, I think the final answer is 88572. Wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. This expression resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's consider the general form. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting from L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_p(n) = B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, we can use this formula to compute the value at layer n=9: L(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches the result we got earlier by computing each layer manually. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, both methods give the same result, which makes me confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, if I had to compute it using the formula, I could have directly calculated L(9) using the formula and then multiplied by 3. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step without any errors, and the formula corroborates the result, I feel very confident that the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I'm seeing a pattern here. Each layer seems to be multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Let me check that. So, Layer 1: 4. Layer 2: 3*4 + 1 = 13. Layer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 40. If I continue this way, I can compute each subsequent layer. Let me try to compute all the layers up to Layer 9. So, Layer 4: 3*40 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121. Layer 5: 3*121 + 1 = 363 + 1 = 364. Layer 6: 3*364 + 1 = 1092 + 1 = 1093. Layer 7: 3*1093 + 1 = 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 8: 3*3280 + 1 = 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 9: 3*9841 + 1 = 29523 + 1 = 29524. Wait a second, hold on. I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, that's nine layers. Let me recount the layers I computed:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times that outermost layer, right? Because the problem is 3*(...), where ... is the entire nested expression. So, I need to compute 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might be confusing. Alternatively, I can just multiply 29524 by 3 digit by digit.\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again to be sure. 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, the first ( is Layer 1: 1+3(...). Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...\n2. (1+3(...\n3. (1+3(...\n4. (1+3(...\n5. (1+3(...\n6. (1+3(...\n7. (1+3(...\n8. (1+3(...\n9. (1+3(...\n\nWait, actually, the innermost is (1+3), and then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1+3), then Layer 2: (1+3(Layer1)), and so on until Layer 9. So, yes, nine layers. Therefore, Layer9 is 29524, and 3*Layer9 is 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step, writing down each computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572. Just to make sure, let me try a different approach, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. We know that a_1 = 4, so:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, for n=0, if we consider a_0, it would be 1 + 3*a_{-1}, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, we can use the recurrence to find a general formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is given by a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods confirm the same answer. So, I'm pretty confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence, we derive a general formula for the nth layer. Using this formula, we compute the ninth layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of nine terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). Start from the innermost term.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 = 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify it another way. 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. Let's compute each part:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches.

Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it all together: 88572. Hmm, same result. Wait, but when I broke it down earlier, I had 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12, which adds up to 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But let me verify each step because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let's go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 =40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 =1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such nested expressions, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be feasible. But just to make sure, maybe I can spot a pattern or find a formula to compute it without manually calculating each layer. Let's see. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is a repeated multiplication and addition. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, it's a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see. The recursive formula is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write it as L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p(n) = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = L_h(n) + L_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1)=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 =8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L(4)=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L(9)=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost layer after 9 nestings is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I checked each step manually, then found a formula to compute the nth layer, which gave the same result.

    "text": " Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me check the next layer to see if it continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Wait a minute, these numbers are growing quickly. Let me see if I can spot a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Each layer seems to be following the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me write down the terms I have so far: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's like a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3, but with an added 1 each time. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series. The general formula for the nth term of a geometric series is a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term and r is the common ratio. But in this case, each term is 3 times the previous plus 1, so it's not exactly a simple geometric series. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this recursion. The recursion is given by: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recursion to find a general formula. To solve a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, I can use the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. First, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Next, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging this into the recursion: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to make sure it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, each layer n can be computed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since our problem has nine layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9. So, the value of Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final value is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by computing each layer step by step, noticed a pattern, derived a recursive formula, solved the recursion to find a closed-form expression, and then applied it to the 9th layer. Then multiplied by 3. Each step seems logical, and the formula checked out with the initial terms. So, I think the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recursive formula. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving the recursion, we find a closed-form formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. Finally, multiplying the result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total value is 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify that because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 *3 is 88,572. Yep, that matches. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Let me just check my earlier layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. So, each layer seems to compute correctly. Therefore, the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572. I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result, which reinforces that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is similar to a geometric series. Let me explore that approach as well. Each a_n can be expressed as a sum of 3's multiplied by powers of 3. For example, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n. This is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n. The sum of a geometric series is given by (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, so the sum is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier using the recurrence relation. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I end up with the same result. I think that solidifies the answer. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the approach works. Let's say, instead of nine layers, let's take two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Compute this. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, using the formula: n=2, a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Then, 3*a_2=39, which matches. So, the formula works for smaller n, which gives me more confidence. Therefore, I can be sure that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final value of 29,524 before multiplying by 3. The result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 3 * 29524 should be 88572.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So,\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A = 1 + 3A \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 *29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could also recognize that each layer is building up a number in base 3 or something, but I think the recurrence approach is solid here.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and compute each layer from the inside out.\n2. Either compute each layer step by step or find a closed-form formula using recurrence relations.\n3. Verify the computations to ensure accuracy.\n\nBoth methods led me to the same final answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let's continue. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, we have 3 * 29524. Let's compute that. 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's verify that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So 363 plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1092 plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So 3279 plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 29523 plus 1 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

    "text": " Now, moving out one layer: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Next layer: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next layer. Let me try to compute each layer up to Layer 9. Let me list them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524. But the original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 4*3 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nThen, 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext, 5*3 = 15, write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nThen, 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8 and carry over 2.\n\nNext, 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nFinally, 2 (the ten-thousands place) *3 = 6.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 6, 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Wait, 29524 is 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply each digit:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n- Ten thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, let me confirm that: 29524 * 3. Let me add 29524 three times to check:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computation. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is based on the previous term. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nThis confirms that the value is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial approach. So, the problem is to compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) which is 3 times Layer 9, where Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*Layer9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to think about it, but I think this is solid. The key was recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which avoids having to compute each layer manually, especially if there were more layers. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable, but the formula would be helpful for a larger number of layers.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to ensure consistency.\n\nFor Layer 1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: (3^{5} -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: (3^{6} -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: (3^{7} -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: (3^{8} -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: (3^{9} -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer checks out with the formula, so the final computation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern, we can model each layer with a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution. \n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is defined as \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n2. **Solve the recurrence**: The closed-form solution is \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n3. **Compute the innermost layers** up to the ninth layer, which gives \\( a_9 = 29524 \\).\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ". So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me do the next few layers to see if I can spot a pattern or a shortcut. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3 = 27,000, 800*3 = 2,400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 3*9841 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. So, Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000*3 = 60,000; 9,000*3 = 27,000; 500*3 = 1,500; 20*3 = 60; 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, in my previous calculation, I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. So, that's correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. 3*1,093 is 3,279. So, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,280 is 9,840. So, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. 3*9,841 is 29,523. So, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, the outermost layer: 3*29,524. Let me compute that again. 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3 = 60,000. 9,000*3 = 27,000. 500*3 = 1,500. 20*3 = 60. 4*3 = 12. Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's the right answer. To make sure, maybe I can try computing it another way or look for a pattern or formula that could have simplified the process instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me see. Each layer seems to be following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, we have a recurrence relation here: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Suppose a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's expand the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, subtracting 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. We know that a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, that confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ". Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Let me correct that. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, and 3*24 = 72. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost 3*29524: 3*29524. Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88,572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be thorough, I can check one or two layers again. Let's pick Layer 5 and Layer 7. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, plus 3*1=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Okay, I feel confident that each step is accurate. Therefore, the final result is indeed 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a second, but the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Let me check the original problem again. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88,572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify the calculations because each layer might have been a miscalculation. Let me go back step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in any layer.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29,524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7         3\n_________\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because each layer's value was increasing rapidly, which is expected because each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which can lead to exponential growth. So, perhaps 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with nine layers. Let me think about it.\n\nThe expression is a repeated application of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x. So, each layer is f applied to the previous layer. Starting from x\u2080 = 1, then x\u2081 = f(x\u2080) = 1 + 3*1 = 4, x\u2082 = f(x\u2081) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to x\u2088, since we have nine layers (from x\u2080 to x\u2088). Wait, no, actually, the innermost is x\u2080 = 1 + 3, which is 4, then x\u2081 = 1 + 3x\u2080, and so on, up to x\u2088, which would be the ninth layer. Then, the entire expression is 3x\u2088. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for x\u2099 where n is the number of layers.\n\nLet me see. The function f(x) = 1 + 3x is linear, and each x\u2099 = f(x\u2099\u208b\u2081). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is x\u2099 = 1 + 3x\u2099\u208b\u2081, with x\u2080 = 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is x\u2099 - 3x\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is x\u2099^h = A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution x\u2099^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is x\u2099 = x\u2099^h + x\u2099^p = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition x\u2080 = 1.\n\nWhen n = 0: x\u2080 = A*3^0 - 1/2 = A - 1/2 = 1.\n\nSo, A = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is x\u2099 = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: x\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, x\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n = 8 (since we start counting from x\u2080). Therefore, x\u2088 = (3^(8+1) - 1)/2 = (3^9 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, x\u2088 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nWait, that's the same as Layer 8 in my earlier step-by-step calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3 times x\u2088, which is 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, no, that can't be right because in my step-by-step, I had Layer 9 as 29524, which was 1 + 3*9841, and then the entire expression was 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. The general solution gives x\u2099 as the value after n+1 layers, perhaps? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, in the recurrence, x\u2080 = 1, which is the innermost layer, Layer 1. Then, x\u2081 is Layer 2, up to x\u2088 being Layer 9. So, x\u2088 is Layer 9, which is 9841. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*9841 = 29,523. But in my step-by-step earlier, I had Layer 9 as 29,524, which was 1 + 3*9841, and then the entire expression was 3*29,524 = 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the general solution. Let me double-check.\n\nThe general solution is x\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n = 8, x\u2088 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841, which matches my step-by-step calculation for Layer 8. Then, Layer 9 would be x\u2089 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation where Layer 9 was 29524. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. But according to the general solution, x\u2089 is 29524, so the expression is 3*x\u2089 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, perhaps the number of layers is nine, which would correspond to n=9 in the general solution, giving x\u2089 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*x\u2089 = 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed each layer step by step, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572, which seems correct. So, perhaps my initial confusion was because I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers in the original problem. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 (Layer 1)\nThen, 1 + 3(...) (Layer 2)\nContinuing until the outermost Layer 9.\n\nSo, indeed, there are nine layers, each corresponding to a new application of the function f(x) = 1 + 3x. Therefore, the value at Layer 9 is x\u2089 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*x\u2089 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but according to the general solution, x\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, x\u2089 = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*x\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula without computing each layer. Let me see.\n\nSince each layer is x\u2099 = 1 + 3x\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from x\u2080 = 1, then x\u2081 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, x\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to x\u2089.\n\nBut using the formula, x\u2089 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*x\u2089 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try expanding it.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E\u2080 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, E\u2081 = 1 + 3*E\u2080\nE\u2082 = 1 + 3*E\u2081\n...\nE\u2088 = 1 + 3*E\u2087\n\nAnd the entire expression is 3*E\u2088.\n\nSo, E\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4\nE\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nE\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nE\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nE\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nE\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nE\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nE\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nE\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\nThen, 3*E\u2088 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with both the step-by-step calculation and the general formula.\n\nWait a minute, but let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1 + 3(\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another \"1 + 3(\", so let's count them:\n\n1. 1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nSo, there are nine instances of \"1 + 3(\", which means nine layers. Therefore, E\u2080 to E\u2088, with E\u2088 being the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nThus, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure no arithmetic errors.\n\nE\u2080 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*E\u2088 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula x\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers minus one, because x\u2080 corresponds to Layer 1. Wait, no, in the formula, n is the number of times we apply the function f(x) = 1 + 3x. So, if we have nine layers, that would be n=9, so x\u2089 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*x\u2089 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely certain, let me compute 3^10 manually.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, so 3^10 is 59,049. Then, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. So, x\u2089 = 29,524. Then, 3*x\u2089 = 88,572.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer, verifying with a general formula, and double-checking the arithmetic, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 3*29524: I can break it down as 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24). Wait, actually, 29524 is 29,524. Let me compute 3*29,524. 3*20,000 = 60,000; 3*9,000 = 27,000; 3*500 = 1,500; 3*24 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the multiplications and additions. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be more straightforward. Wait, actually, let me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, computing up to a_9 gives me 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Yeah, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution can be expressed as a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0*r^{n}, but in this case, a_0 would be 1, but wait, actually, our first term is a_1 = 4. Wait, maybe I should check the formula. The general solution for a_n = k + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + k*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, a_0 would be the initial term before the first a_1. Wait, in our case, a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, so a_0 would be 1. So, applying the formula, a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Since a_0 = 1, this becomes a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. Simplifying, that's (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1 = 59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, a_9 = 29,524.

    "text": " Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a second, but the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the whole nested expression. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, carry over 0. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524*3=88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or check if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression. Let me compute the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent a_n. Let me think about solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost layer, layer 9, is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. I think this is correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute it another way. Maybe by expanding the expression step by step without using the formula. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 =4. Then, moving outwards: 1 +3*4=13, 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, same result. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model this. If I denote the entire expression as S, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). But the inner part is similar to S but one layer less. Wait, no, because each time you go in, it's another layer. Maybe it's better to model it as a geometric series with n terms. Since there are 9 layers, maybe it's a finite geometric series. Let me think about it. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). There are 9 layers, so the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, as I found earlier, each a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. And using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. So, this seems consistent. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))) with 9 layers, then S = 3*a_9, where a_9=29524, so S=88572. I think I've verified it multiple ways, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can break down the expression starting from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.
