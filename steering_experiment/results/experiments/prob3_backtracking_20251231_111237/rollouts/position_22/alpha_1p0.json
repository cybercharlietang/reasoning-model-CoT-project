    "text": " Wait, no, that's too simple. Let me check: the innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that seems to be a pattern where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me write this down more clearly.\n\nCompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses, I need to multiply that result by 3. Let me confirm that. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3)\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, add them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a pattern in the layers. Let's see, each layer is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer (n-1))\n\nWith Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is Layer n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's test this:\n\nAssume Layer n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer (n-1)) = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, Layer n = A*3^n + 3B + 1.\n\nBut according to our assumption, Layer n = A*3^n + B.\n\nTherefore, equating the two expressions:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition: Layer 1 = 4.\n\nLayer 1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier:\n\nFor Layer 1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I wrote 88,572. Yes, that's correct. 88,572.\n\nLet me just make sure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors when multiplying 29524 by 3. Let's compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8,7,5,7,2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me do it properly.\n\nWait, actually, when multiplying:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87,572? Wait, that's different from what I had before. Wait, 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n9 \u00d73=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 87,572. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 88,572. Hmm, so which is correct? Let me check with another method.\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d73=60,000\n\n9000 \u00d73=27,000\n\n500 \u00d73=1,500\n\n24 \u00d73=72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting two different results. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87,572, but when I broke it down into parts, I got 88,572. There must be a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nLet me check the digit-by-digit multiplication again:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d73=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d73=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom: 8,7,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 87,572. But when I broke it down, I got 88,572.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the digits in the digit-by-digit method. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n----------\n\nUnits place: 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\nTens place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nHundreds place: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n\nThousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nTen-thousands place: 9\u00d73=27 \u21927, carry 2.\n\nHundred-thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 87,572.\n\nBut when I broke it down, I had:\n\n20000\u00d73=60,000\n\n9000\u00d73=27,000\n\n500\u00d73=1,500\n\n24\u00d73=72\n\nAdding them: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572.\n\nWait, so which is correct? There's a discrepancy here. Let me check using another method, maybe adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 +29524=59048\n\n59048 +29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the digit-by-digit multiplication must have been wrong. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, in the digit-by-digit method, I think I might have miscounted the places. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit (tens place): 2 \u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nNext digit (hundreds place):5 \u00d73=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit (thousands place):2 \u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nNext digit (ten-thousands place):9 \u00d73=27. Write 7, carry 2.\n\nNext digit (hundred-thousands place):2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,7,7,8.\n\nWait, that's 87,572.\n\nBut when I added 29524 three times, I got 88,572.\n\nWait, there's a contradiction here. Let me compute 29524 \u00d73 using standard multiplication:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n----------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n9\u00d73=27. Write 7, carry 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing the digits: 8,7,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 87,572.\n\nBut when I add 29524 +29524 +29524, I get:\n\n29524 +29524 = 59048\n\n59048 +29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, which one is correct? There must be a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me write it out vertically:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n\n   \u00d7        3\n\n   ------------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d73=12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nNext digit:5 \u00d73=15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit:2 \u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nNext digit:9 \u00d73=27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit:2 \u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing the digits: 8 7 7 5 7 2.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, the digits are written from right to left, so the first digit is 2 (units), then 7 (tens), then 5 (hundreds), then 7 (thousands), then 2 (ten-thousands), and finally 8 (hundred-thousands). Wait, that can't be because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Wait, 29524 \u00d73:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nFirst, 4\u00d73=12. Write 2, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15. Write 5, carry 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n9\u00d73=27. Write 7, carry 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing the digits: 8,7,5,7,2. Wait, that's 87,572. But when I add 29524 three times, I get 88,572. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 \u00d73 using another method. Let's compute 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nBreak it down as (30000 - 476) \u00d73 = 30000\u00d73 - 476\u00d73 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the digit-by-digit multiplication must have been wrong because I think I miscounted the digits or made a carry-over mistake. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, Layer 9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 \u00d73 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, I arrived at the outermost layer being 29524. Then, multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting with the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost one. Finally, we multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nMultiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": ". That's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Wait, but the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So the total value is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of a different way to approach this problem, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just confirm once more by computing each layer again quickly: Layer 1:4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe that's the innermost part. So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that's Layer 2. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me verify: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a minute, but let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount each layer. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) So, each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, after expanding, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}. Wait, is that correct? Let me test with n=1: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. If n=1, the sum would be 1 + 3^1 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. The sum would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 =13. Correct. Similarly, n=3: a_3 =1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=1 +3*13=40. The sum is 1 +3 +9 +27=40. Correct. So, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula we derived earlier. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. So, this confirms the result again. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

    "text": ". So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 = 360, and 1*3 = 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify the multiplication: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. Wait, hold on, that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to compute it step by step: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Finally, the last digit: 9*3=27, write down 27. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so we should have five digits after multiplication. Let me correct that. Let me write it out properly:\n\n     29524\n   x     3\n   --------\n     ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8, carryover 0.\n\nFinally, the 2 (the ten-thousands place) is multiplied by 3: 2*3=6, write down 6.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 6 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, which is a 5-digit number. Wait, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.

I went through each layer step by step, computed each one carefully, and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3. I also double-checked the multiplication to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds one more. From the expression, I see that after the initial 3, there are 9 layers, each starting with (1 + 3(...)).

    "text": ". That was simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Writing it out: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 + 1 carried over =7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe I should write this as a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*a1. So, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, Layer 3 would be a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, this seems to be a pattern where each layer is 1 plus three times the previous layer. Let me check that. So, a1 = 4, a2 = 13, a3 = 40. Let me compute a few more to see if I can find a pattern or maybe a formula. a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, so each a_n is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a1 = 4, each subsequent a is 1 + 3 times the previous one. So, I'm building a sequence here. But how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each time I have a \"1 + 3(\" that's a new layer. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next one is 1 + 3(1 + 3), and so on, until the outermost one. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" occurrences. Looking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another \"1 + 3(\", and the outermost is just multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step adds another \"1+3(\" until we get to the outermost. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the expression. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(, so the number of layers is 9, because each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and the outermost is the ninth one. Wait, actually, the innermost is 1+3, which is one layer, and each additional \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, the total number of layers is 9, as there are 9 \"1+3(\" in the expression. Wait, let me check again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer, and each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1, then each additional \"1+3(\" adds another layer, so the total number of layers is 9. Therefore, I need to compute up to a9, and then multiply by 3. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to a9 as 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations step by step, because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the sequence. Let me go through each layer again, carefully.\n\nStarting with layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nSo, up to layer 9, a9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times a9, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. The original expression is 3*(a9), so yes, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\na1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial step of identifying the number of layers. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the original expression again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" starting from the innermost.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another \"1+3(\".\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, which is one layer.\n\nThen, the next one is 1+3(1+3), which is two layers.\n\nContinuing this way, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, how many \"1+3(\" are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(.\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the first \"1+3(\", then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, from the innermost, the first \"1+3\" is layer 1, then each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of \"1+3(\" from the inside out.\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is one layer.\n\nThen, moving outward, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, the expression has nine \"1+3(\" instances, meaning there are nine layers, each one wrapping around the previous.\n\nTherefore, I correctly computed up to a9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of error.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, a1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nEither way, the result is 88572.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

    "text": " Hmm, that's simple enough. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Since Layer 2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 = let's see, 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093. Let me compute that: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841. Let's calculate that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000; 9000*3=27000; 500*3=1500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12.

    "text": ". So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 is 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, Layer 3 is 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 is 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 is 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Moving on, Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. So Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 123 = 29523. So Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Wait, 29524 is 29,524. Let me do it digit by digit. 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3 is 88,572. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high. Let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 *3 again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if we let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is computed as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1: 4; n=2:13; n=3:40; n=4:121; n=5:364; n=6:1093; n=7:3280; n=8:9841; n=9:29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88,572. Alternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. The recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear. It can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": ". So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, that might not be the best way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let me do it step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7.\n- 5 *3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n- 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me check with another method to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) *3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the total expression is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again quickly to check for any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct. Wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern that I can exploit. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, starting from layer 1 as 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nWait, let's see: If a_1=4, then a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, and so on, which matches what I did earlier.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2= (9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, I also arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but given the structure, it's a bit more involved. However, the recursive approach and the closed-form formula both lead me to the same conclusion, so I think it's safe to say that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- I broke down the expression into layers, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n- Each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n- I computed each layer step by step, ensuring each step was correct.\n\n- Then, I recognized the pattern as a linear recurrence relation and found a closed-form solution to verify the result.\n\n- Both methods gave me the same final value for the innermost layer, and then multiplying by 3 gave me the final answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm pretty sure that the computed value is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. Using a recursive approach and verifying with a closed-form formula for the sequence, we determine that the innermost layer (Layer 9) is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 + 3*(next inner layer). There are nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:**\n   The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.

Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). That's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1,092, plus 1 is 1,093. Layer 6 is 1,093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093. 3*1,093 is 3,279, plus 1 is 3,280. Layer 7 is 3,280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280. 3*3,280 is 9,840, plus 1 is 9,841. Layer 8 is 9,841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841. 3*9,841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...), where ... is Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29,524. Let me calculate that: 3*29,524. Well, 30,000*3 is 90,000, and 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000. So, 476*3 is 1,428. Therefore, 3*29,524 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. Maybe it's easier to just multiply 29,524 by 3 directly. 29,524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together, starting from the right: 2, then 7, then 5, then 8, then 7, then 2, then 8, then 7. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should do it more carefully: 29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7 \u2192 write 7, no carry.\n\n5 * 3 =15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8, no carry.\n\n9 * 3=27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\n5 * 3=15 +2=17 \u2192 write 7, carry 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, the result is 88,572. Wait, that can't be right because 29,524 *3=88,572. Let me check with another method: 29,524 *3 = (30,000 - 476) *3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.

Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.

Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.

Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3: 120*3=360, and 1*3=3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. Breaking it down: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Moving on to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original expression isn't just Layer 9; it's 3 times Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, 3*29524.

So, the total is 88572. Wait, that seems really big. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let me try to see if this is a geometric series or something similar. Let's write out the first few layers: Layer 1: 4 = 1 + 3*1\nLayer 2: 13 = 1 + 3*4\nLayer 3: 40 = 1 + 3*13\nLayer 4: 121 = 1 + 3*40\nLayer 5: 364 = 1 + 3*121\nLayer 6: 1093 = 1 + 3*364\nLayer 7: 3280 = 1 + 3*1093\nLayer 8: 9841 = 1 + 3*3280\nLayer 9: 29524 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nLooking at the coefficients, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This is similar to a recurrence relation. Let me denote L(n) as Layer n. So, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L(1) = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula, Layer 9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": ". Okay, that's simple. So Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving out another layer, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me continue this process step by step. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits. Wait, 29524: digits are 2,9,5,2,4. So:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8, carry 0.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3: Let me do it another way. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 *3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, that matches. So 3*29524 = 88572. So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer, I computed each layer step by step, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. Then, the outermost layer was 3 times the result of the innermost computation. Each step involved multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Let me confirm each layer quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think that's correct. Each step seems to follow logically, and I didn't see any calculation errors upon reviewing. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the result of Layer 9 by 3 gives the final answer:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ". That's straightforward. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3, which is 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 364*3. Let me do that step by step: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000+600=9600, plus 240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the total value is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000+27000=87000, plus 1500=88500, plus 60=88560, plus 12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just quickly verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 =40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 + 120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364.

Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Substituting Layer 2: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.

Let me calculate 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.

Now, moving out another layer: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Continuing to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.

Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.

    "text": ". So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is let me compute that: 9841*3. Let's do 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write it in homogeneous form. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the initial layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer. I think this solidifies that the answer is indeed 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern, a recursive formula is applied, leading to a closed-form solution. Both methods confirm the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n2. **Compute each layer sequentially**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let's see, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Let me break this down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.

Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 363 + 1 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems pretty big, but considering each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it does grow exponentially. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, maybe there's a general formula for a_n. Let's try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer, which would have saved time, especially if the number of layers was larger. But since it's only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. However, it's good to know that there's a formula for such nested expressions, which can be really helpful for more complex problems. So, in summary, by breaking down the problem layer by layer and recognizing the pattern, I was able to compute the value step by step. Additionally, deriving the closed-form formula helped confirm the result and would be useful for similar problems in the future.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. Recognizing the pattern, we derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer, which simplifies the computation. Using this formula, we find the value of the outermost layer and multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Because the entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88572.

Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As before, 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But wait, let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 instances of 1+3(...). So, each layer is one more than the previous. So, Layer 1: 1+3, Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), ..., up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, 9 layers in total. So, my calculation seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Sometimes, when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me try an alternative approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula here. The expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. We can write this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Now, solving this recurrence relation might give us a closed-form formula, which could help in computing a_9 more easily. Let me recall how to solve linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. In this case, c=3 and d=1. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - d/(1 - c)) * c^{n-1} + d/(1 - c), provided that c \u2260 1. Since c=3, which is not equal to 1, we can use this formula. First, compute the constant term: d/(1 - c) = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. Then, the solution becomes: a_n = (a_1 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2). Simplify inside the parentheses: a_1 = 4, so 4 - (-1/2) = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, a_n = (9/2)*3^{n-1} - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3^{0} - 1/2 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*3^{1} - 1/2 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, as we computed earlier. For n=3: a_3 = (9/2)*3^2 - 1/2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{8} - 1/2. Let me compute 3^8 first. 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8 = 6561. Now, a_9 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2. Let me compute each term: (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let's compute 9*6561: 6561*9. 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500, +540 = 59040, +9=59049. So, (9/2)*6561 = 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this alternative method using the recurrence relation confirms the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 4*3=12 +2=14, write down 4, carry over 1. 0*3=0 +1=1. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and double-checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Let's do Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let me compute that. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait, let me verify one more time because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate. Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4 (Layer 1). Then, each subsequent layer adds 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Yes, that's nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. As before, 29524*3: 29524*3. Let me compute this multiplication step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). That's 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding up: 60000 + 27000=87000, +1500=88500, +72=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I did it right. Each step follows logically, and I didn't skip any layers. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time worked well. I was worried I might make a multiplication error somewhere, but by breaking it down and adding each part separately, I think I avoided that. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": ". So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives us 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives us 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 times the result of Layer 9. So, we need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I broke it down as 3*29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = 88572. But let me check another way. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 is 88572. Correct. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. Each layer was computed correctly, and the multiplication at the end is accurate.

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.

Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.

    "text": " Wait, that's just 1 plus 3, which is 4. So, Layer 1 is 4. Then, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me write down the values as I compute them: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: Let's compute that. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is... Let me compute that. 9841 * 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the steps I took. So, I think the final answer is 88572. I wonder if there's a quicker way to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be generalized for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution can be found using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b/(a-1)). Wait, let me make sure. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant since b is a constant. Let me find the particular solution. Assume L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer I got by manually computing each layer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and the closed-form solution corroborates the step-by-step computation. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So, the total expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, giving a_1=4. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would correspond to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me verify the exponentiation: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Therefore, a_9 is (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing this as a recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form solution. The nth term of the sequence is given by \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\).

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. So, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the problem is 3*(Layer 9). Therefore, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any errors. Starting from the innermost parentheses, I calculated each layer step by step, each time substituting the value of the inner layer into the outer one. Each layer was 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing all nine layers, I ended up with Layer 9 being 29524. Then, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final result of 88572. I think that's correct, but let me verify the multiplication one more time to be sure. 29524*3: Let's break it down digit by digit. 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, yes, 29524*3 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's it. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and each step built upon the previous one correctly. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": ". So, Layer 1 is 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: that's 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523, so adding those together: 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can notice a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me see: Starting from Layer 1: 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression. The expression is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Specifically, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, the solution can be written as a_n = (3^n * a_0) + (3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + ... + 3^0), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 4, so maybe the indexing is a bit different. Let me think. If we have a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That confirms my previous result. Alternatively, I can compute 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. Well, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

    "text": ". That's simple enough. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Okay, moving out another layer, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me continue to see if it's consistent. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, that would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, no, that's breaking it down incorrectly. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24. Let's compute each part: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 equals 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Each step seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's a nonhomogeneous one because of the constant term 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've considered this problem from multiple angles, checked my work, and even derived a formula to solve it more efficiently. It's always reassuring to see that different methods lead to the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. The answer should be 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*(13). Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original problem is 3*(...), where ... is the whole nested expression. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me compute 3*29524. Hmm, let's do it step by step. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that I can recognize here to avoid computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, and then we find a particular solution. Alternatively, since the recurrence is linear and has constant coefficients, we can solve it iteratively or recognize it as a geometric series. Let me try to write out the terms to see if a pattern emerges. Starting with a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Now, if I think of each a_n as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the formula applies correctly here. The formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 gives the value for each layer, starting from n=1 as 4. So, for n=9, it's 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I denote the innermost expression as x, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3x, and so on. But since there are nine layers, it's going to be a bit complex.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula we derived, since each layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost layer is layer 9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure with repeating terms.\n2. Compute each layer from the inside out.\n3. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations.\n4. Apply the formula to find the value of the outermost layer.\n5. Multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nThis systematic approach helps avoid errors and ensures that each step is correct. It's also useful to verify with a formula if possible, especially when dealing with repetitive structures like this one.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern here. Let me keep going to see if I can find a formula or a shortcut. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 3*3=9. Wait, actually, maybe it's better to compute it step by step: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000. 9000*3=27000. 500*3=1500. 20*3=60. 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's denote L(n) as the value of Layer n. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence might give me a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. Plugging in the initial condition: L(1) = 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Also, let's compute L(2): L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Plugging n=2 into the general solution: L(2) = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we have a system of equations: 3A + B = 4, 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the final answer. I think this approach using the recurrence relation helped me confirm the result without having to compute each layer step by step, which could be error-prone, especially with so many layers. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allowed me to find a formula and solve it more efficiently. I guess practice helps in noticing these kinds of patterns quickly!\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each following the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, where n is the layer number. Applying this formula to the ninth layer gives us 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363.

Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279.

Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have 3*(29524). Let's compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n2. Substitute back and compute each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\n   \\]\n3. Finally, multiply by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."
