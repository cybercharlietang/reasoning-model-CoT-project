Hmm, seems consistent. Let me check with another method to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about the structure. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1 =4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is the outermost one, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10=59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's see: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general term for a_n. The standard approach for such a linear recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is a_9, it would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, a_9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So that's another way to compute it. Either way, the result is 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used a recursive formula, and even derived a closed-form expression to confirm. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's find the closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see. Let's denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Wait, but since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and we have nine layers, perhaps the total expression can be represented as a sum. Let me try to expand it. Let me see: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let me try to expand it step by step. Let me define the innermost as before, but perhaps I can see a pattern. Each time, when you expand a layer, you get 1 + 3*previous. So, starting from the innermost: Let's say we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572. So, same as before. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the sum. Let me consider that each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an added 1 each time. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. Let me think. If I consider the layers, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, as we saw earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to expand the entire expression step by step, without using the layers. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let me expand the innermost parentheses first: The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, we have 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572. So, same result again. Alternatively, maybe I can write this as a sum. Let me think about how many times each power of 3 appears. Let me try to expand E step by step, writing each multiplication. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) Let me compute the innermost first: The innermost expression is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, each layer adds a 1 and multiplies by 3. So, layer by layer: Layer 1: 4 = 1 + 3^1 Layer 2: 13 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Alternatively, 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2. Because 3*4 is 12, which is 3 + 3^2. So, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Layer 3: 40 = 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Alternatively, 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Because 3*13 is 39, which is 3 + 9 + 27. So, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Layer 4: 121 = 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Alternatively, 121 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81. Because 3*40 is 120, which is 3 + 9 + 27 + 81. So, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. Layer 5: 364 = 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Alternatively, 364 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243. Because 3*121 is 363, which is 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243. So, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 364. Layer 6: 1093 = 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Alternatively, 1093 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729. Because 3*364 is 1092, which is 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729. So, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 = 1093. Layer 7: 3280 = 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Alternatively, 3280 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187. Because 3*1093 is 3279, which is 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187. So, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 = 3280. Layer 8: 9841 = 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Alternatively, 9841 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561. Because 3*3280 is 9840, which is 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561. So, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 = 9841. Layer 9: 29524 = 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Alternatively, 29524 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683. Because 3*9841 is 29523, which is 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683. So, 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683 = 29524. Then, the entire expression E is 3 times this, so 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can see that each layer adds another term in the geometric series. So, for each layer n, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but in our case, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but not exactly because the recurrence is a bit different. Wait, actually, the sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly what we derived earlier for a_n. So, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Therefore, E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with all the methods I've tried. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just check my calculations one more time to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct.

So, all steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, computing each one is manageable. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), where L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation of the form L(n) = a*L(n-1) + b, the solution is L(n) = a^n * L(0) + b*(a^n - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. In our case, a = 3 and b = 1. Wait, but our first term is L(1) = 4. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. Let me see, the general solution for L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. So, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p(n) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since the expression is 3*(L(9)), where L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see if I can model this as a geometric series. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, let's see if there's a pattern or formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for C and D. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, and with 9 layers, it's a geometric progression with ratio 3, but the closed-form approach seems more straightforward. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative approach and the closed-form formula give the same result.

So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe for just nine layers, computing step by step is manageable. Alternatively, the expression is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Wait, actually, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), so it's a linear recurrence. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - r))*(r)^{n-1} - c/(1 - r). Wait, but in this case, r = 3 and c =1. Let me check. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 =4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K =1 +3K => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4.

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Wait, because n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the layers go up to 9, maybe I can express the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 =3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572. Same result.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, perhaps. Let me see if I can express this recursively. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I did earlier. So, perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with my earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10 = 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula, I can directly compute the result without having to compute each layer individually, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I had only nine layers, it wasn't too bad to compute each step manually either. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, I was able to find a formula for the nth layer and compute the final result efficiently. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and saved some computation time, but it's good to verify both ways. Another way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each step is 3*previous +1. But regardless, the final answer seems consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n, then the sequence is defined recursively. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me see. The recursive relation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n +1, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n +1. Substitute the general solution: A*3^{n+1} + B = 3*(A*3^{n} + B) +1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n} + 3*B +1 = A*3^{n+1} + 3B +1. So, left side: A*3^{n+1} + B. Right side: A*3^{n+1} + 3B +1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^{n+1} + B = A*3^{n+1} + 3B +1. Subtract A*3^{n+1} from both sides: B = 3B +1. Then, -2B =1 => B= -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B =4. We know B=-1/2, so 3A -1/2=4 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly. Since the expression is 3*(a_9)=3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute it step by step, using the recursive formula, or using the closed-form expression, I get the same result. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is multiplied by 3. Using a recursive approach or a closed-form formula confirms that the final answer is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I could have used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time we're adding 1 and then tripling the result. This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on up to a_9. So, the expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the result after 9 layers. So, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. First, let's write down the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. Now, to find a closed-form solution, we can solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = A*c^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since d is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2. Similarly, n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for our problem, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3\n3^2=9\n3^3=27\n3^4=81\n3^5=243\n3^6=729\n3^7=2187\n3^8=6561\n3^9=19683\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the original expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the closed-form solution also leads us to the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series, but since each term depends on the previous one, it's a linear recurrence. But in any case, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step isn't too bad. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of terms, computing each step is manageable. But just for fun, let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Suppose L_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step, but instead using the recurrence relation. However, since I was able to compute each layer step by step correctly, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants to be determined. Let's substitute into the recurrence: A*3^n + C = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + C) = 1 + A*3^n + 3C. Simplify: A*3^n + C = A*3^n + 1 + 3C. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: C = 1 + 3C. Then, 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a nested multiplication where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. Then, we can see that each term is built upon the previous one. So, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to find a pattern or a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, which has the solution a_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{part} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values we have: For n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we need a_9, let's compute that: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms our earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the computations, and the formula approach also leads to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let me denote the value of each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4 a_2 =1 +3*a1=1 +12=13 a_3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40 a_4=1 +3*a3=1 +120=121 a_5=1 +3*a4=1 +363=364 a_6=1 +3*a5=1 +1092=1093 a_7=1 +3*a6=1 +3279=3280 a_8=1 +3*a7=1 +9840=9841 a_9=1 +3*a8=1 +29523=29524 Then the total expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, is there a closed-form formula for a_n? Let's see. The recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants. To find C and D, we can use the initial condition. Let's write down the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)}=C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant D. Plugging into the equation: D =1 +3*D => D -3D=1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our previous calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. That's pretty cool. So, without computing each layer step by step, we can directly compute a_9 using the formula and then multiply by 3. So, that's a more efficient method. But since the problem is to compute it step by step, maybe the first method is more illustrative. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, perhaps this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a direct formula for the entire expression. Let me think. The entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Because 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11}, and 3*1=3. So, (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. I can check the formula again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. The general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, using the formula for the entire expression: (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.

Alternatively, I can check using a different method. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is built upon the previous one. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent a_n is built from the previous term. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, as I computed earlier. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n} * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1), assuming k \u2260 1. In this case, k=3, c=1. Wait, let me verify. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, yes, k=3, c=1. The initial condition is a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, let's index it properly. If n=1, a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. So, the general solution for a_n would be a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation properly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. Perfect.

Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence yields a closed-form formula, which when applied to the 9 layers, results in the final value of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about whether I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's say we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. Then each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, in this problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 would be the innermost part, and then we have the outermost multiplication by 3. Wait, actually, in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(...), so maybe the innermost is a_1=1+3=4, then a_2=1+3*a_1=13, and so on up to a_9=29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or follows some recursive formula. Let me see if I can model it as a recurrence relation. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, let's see what a_n is in terms of a_{n-1}. It's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say D. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D. Solving for D: D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly. Since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. So that's another way to compute it, using the formula, and it also gives 88572. So that's consistent with both methods. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern, we can use a recurrence relation to find the solution efficiently. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to compute this more efficiently instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this problem has nine layers. Maybe recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final step is to multiply a_9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a formula for such a recursive expression. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that L_1 = 4. So, plugging n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, as n approaches infinity, the term A*3^n would dominate, but since each L_n is finite, perhaps B is a constant term. Alternatively, since the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can solve it as follows: The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution would be a constant, say L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier results. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40.

Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems to be correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and has constant coefficients. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost layer is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, which is what I did initially. So, both methods lead to the same result. I think that solidifies the answer. Just to make sure, let me compute a few layers using the formula to cross-verify. For example, n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier computation. Similarly, n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula is reliable. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, a_2=13= A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtracting the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So yes, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, if I let x be the innermost expression, then each layer is 1 + 3x, and the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3x) = 1 + 3 + 9x, and so on. But with nine layers, it's going to be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8, multiplied by something? Wait, no, because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next. Let me think differently. Let me represent the entire expression as E. So E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. But if I consider that after the first 3*(1 + ..., the inner expression is similar to E/3, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation since the formula worked. Alternatively, since we have a closed-form formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the same result. Either way, the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation. Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we find the innermost value to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I denote L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, etc., up to L9. Then the entire expression is 3*L9. Alternatively, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as computed earlier. Now, to find a general formula for L_n, since it's a linear recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_n = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for L9, n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*(29524)=88572. So, that's the answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.

The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, solving this recurrence relation might give me a formula to compute a_9 directly, which would save time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's better to solve it as a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation method, I also get 88572, which confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation.

Hmm, but wait, when I computed Layer9, I used Layer8 as 9841. Let me check Layer8 again. Layer8 is 1 +3*(Layer7). Layer7 is 3280, so 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Then Layer9 is 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. So 3*29524=88572. So that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, in this case, our recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, if I consider n starting at 1, then for n=1: a1=4, n=2: a2=13, etc. So, the general solution for a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. Let me write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, the initial condition is at n=1: a1=4. So, plugging n=1: a1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A -1/2 =4. Solving for A: 3A =4 +1/2=9/2, so A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. So, for Layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, the innermost layer is Layer1: a1=4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, the outermost expression is Layer9, which is a9. So, using the formula, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following this geometric progression and used the formula directly without computing each layer, but since I already did it step by step, it's reassuring that both methods give the same result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it faster, rather than computing each layer step by step. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer. So, L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L(3) = 1 + 3*L(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L(4) = 1 + 3*L(3) = 1 + 120 = 121. L(5) = 1 + 3*L(4) = 1 + 363 = 364. L(6) = 1 + 3*L(5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L(7) = 1 + 3*L(6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L(8) = 1 + 3*L(7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L(9) = 1 + 3*L(8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, yes, that's the same as before. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for L(n). Let's see: The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition: L(1) = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, we can also find L(2): L(2) = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4, and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Then, plugging back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I have. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L(3)= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L(9)= (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^10. Let's see: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*L(9). And L(9) is (3^10 -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2= (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11=177147. Then, 177147 -3=177144. Divided by 2: 177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to see it, and it confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me see: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for such a recurrence. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So r=3, c=1. So the general solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) * 1. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, a_2=13, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me think. If I set a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. So perhaps the formula would be a_n = 3^{n} + something. Let me try to compute a few terms and see if I can find a pattern. a_1 = 4 = 3 + 1\na_2 = 13 = 9 + 4\na_3 = 40 = 27 + 13\na_4 = 121 = 81 + 40\na_5 = 364 = 243 + 121\na_6 = 1093 = 729 + 364\na_7 = 3280 = 2187 + 1093\na_8 = 9841 = 6561 + 3280\na_9 = 29524 = 19683 + 9841\n\nWait, I see that each a_n = 3^{n} + a_{n-1}. For example, a_1 = 3^1 + 1 = 4. a_2 = 3^2 + a_1 = 9 + 4 = 13. a_3 = 3^3 + a_2 = 27 + 13 = 40. a_4 = 3^4 + a_3 = 81 + 40 = 121. Yes, that seems correct. So, in general, a_n = 3^{n} + a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis suggests that a_n = 3^{n} + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + ... + 3^{1} + a_0, but wait, a_1 is 4, which is 3^1 + 1. So maybe the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 + 1? Let me test this. For n=1: (3^{2} - 3)/2 +1 = (9 -3)/2 +1 = 6/2 +1=3+1=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3}-3)/2 +1= (27-3)/2 +1=24/2 +1=12 +1=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -3)/2 +1=78/2 +1=39 +1=40. Correct. So yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 +1. So for a_9, which is the outermost layer, n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} - 3)/2 +1. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 3)/2 +1 = (59046)/2 +1=29523 +1=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, and we have 9 layers, maybe the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series with ratio 3, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.\n\nWait, but using the recurrence relation seems more straightforward. So, in any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same result.

So yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous. So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1=4, L2=13, etc., then each Ln = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form is Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is Ln = a^(n) * C + (b)/(1 - a), but wait, since a \u2260 1, the homogeneous solution is a^n * C, and a particular solution is a constant. Let me compute the particular solution. Let\u2019s assume the particular solution is a constant K. Then, substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is Ln = C*(3)^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4=3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer1, which is L1=4, and the outermost layer is Layer9, which is L9. So, L9=(3^(10)-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer up to Layer9, which I did earlier, and then multiplied by 3. Either way, I arrive at the same result. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation Ln = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Using this, we compute up to the ninth layer, which results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested recurrence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on up to L9, then each Lk = 1 + 3*L(k-1). This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Lk. Let's see. Let me write the recursion: Lk = 1 + 3*L(k-1), with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is Lk - 3*L(k-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Lk = C*3^k + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When k=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is Lk = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Lk = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with k=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For k=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For k=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer k, Lk = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I use the formula for Lk, since Lk = (3^{k+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. Since 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, I get 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula\u2014give me the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.
