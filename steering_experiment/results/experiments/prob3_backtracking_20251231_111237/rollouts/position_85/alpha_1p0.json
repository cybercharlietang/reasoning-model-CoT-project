    "text": " Wait, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. So that's correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3=88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, for each subsequent layer, it's 1 + 3 times the previous layer. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4. Also, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Now, let's see if that works for n=2. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 9A + B = 13. Now, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4, and 9A + B =13. Subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) =13 -4 => 6A =9 => A=9/6=3/2=1.5. Then, from the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B =4 => 9/2 + B =4 => B=4 -9/2=8/2 -9/2= -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2. Simplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check that for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, since the expression has 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Then, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, 177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. So, that's the same result as before, which confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is tripling the previous and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric series. But in this case, the closed-form formula worked out nicely. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. So then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, expanding it all the way, the entire expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is a_9 = 29524, as computed. So, 3*a_9 = 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it without using the recurrence relation, just by expanding each layer step by step, but that seems time-consuming and error-prone, especially since I already have a verified method using the recurrence and the closed-form solution. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, the solution is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, is there a closed-form formula for a_n? Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by solving the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*(3)^n, and the particular solution can be found as a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula instead of computing each layer. But either way, the result is the same. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this is repeated multiple times, it might form a geometric series. Let me think about that. Suppose we have a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the terms go like a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. So, the nth term can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that right? Let me test it. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B by setting a_n = B. Then, B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the innermost being a_1, and the outermost being a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, but since I was working it out step by step, it was a good exercise. I think I've got it right. Just to make sure, let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...))). So, each set of parentheses adds another layer, starting from the innermost. So, layer 1 is 1+3, layer 2 is 1+3*(layer1), and so on up to layer9, which is then multiplied by 3.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it faster. Each layer seems to be following the formula: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I computed before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute a few more layers to make sure my step-by-step approach was right. Let's compute up to Layer 5 again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Now, using the formula, a_5 should be (3^{6} -1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Perfect, that's correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.

    "text": " Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see: Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. If I expand it, maybe I can express it as a sum of powers of 3. Let's try expanding a few layers to see the pattern. Let me denote E as the entire expression. E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let's compute E step by step, but perhaps by expanding each layer as I did before. Alternatively, maybe I can think of E as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed before. But since I've already computed it step by step and also derived a formula, I think that's sufficient. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation here is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, and a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that confirms the answer again. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is found to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. So Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each layer wraps around that. Let me count how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we add another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Let's see: After the first 3, we have (1+3(...). So each time, the number of opening parentheses increases by one. Let me try to parse this expression properly. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then, 1+3*(...)\n3. Then, 1+3*(...)\n4. And so on, until we have nine layers? Wait, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So each layer is indeed one more than the previous. So when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3, getting 88572, that should be correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). How would that work? Let's compute it step by step. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Then, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120. Alternatively, computing directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120. That seems correct. So if I apply the same method to the larger problem, it should work. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Assuming a solution of the form a_n = A*3^n + B, then a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, LHS: A*3^n + B = RHS: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. So, if I expand the expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Expanding this would result in a sum where each term is 3^k, but I think the way I approached it before is more straightforward. Another way to think about it is to recognize that each layer adds another power of 3. For example, Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1 Layer 2: 13 = 3*(3 + 1) + 1 = 3^2 + 3 + 1 Layer 3: 40 = 3*(3^2 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 And so on, so each layer n adds up to 3^n + 3^{n-1} + ... + 3 + 1, which is a geometric series summing to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is consistent with the closed-form solution I found earlier. Therefore, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. So, after all these checks and alternative approaches, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I've considered multiple methods: direct computation layer by layer, solving the recurrence relation, and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. All methods lead to the same result, so I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without doing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Let me try to see if I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, let's see if there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for a_n. The recursion here is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, actually, perhaps it's easier to solve it by iteration. Let's compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each a_n is growing exponentially. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me confirm once more to be sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. Then, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as 29524*2 + 29524 = 59048 + 29524. Let me add those: 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 =79048, 79048 + 9524=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer through both iterative computation and finding a closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe I can find a pattern or formula. Let's see, solving L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would satisfy L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has a solution of L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: Let's see, when n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, that's interesting. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3 * L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3 * (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, or use the formula, I end up with the same answer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were much larger. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with n layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier terms. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just quickly check the multiplication again: 29524 *3. Let me compute 29524 *3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's a geometric series or something similar. Let's see, each layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we saw earlier, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to find it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is a_3=40. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th term, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=59049*3=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or use the closed-form expression, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid.

So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6=1 + 1092=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer7=1 + 3279=3280. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So Layer8=1 + 9840=9841. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So Layer9=1 + 29523=29524. So, yes, that seems correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just check if I didn't make a mistake in any layer computation. Let me recompute Layer 9: 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me do this multiplication step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would be 88572. Wait, but when I write it down, starting from the right, it's 2,7,5,8,8. Wait, that would make it 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. We know that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Substituting into the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Let's expand the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Now, set this equal to the left side: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...+3*(1 +3))...)). Let's see, how many layers are there? Starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 3. Wait, in the original problem, the innermost is 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, if I consider the expression E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3*(1 +3)))), with 9 layers. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that. Each time we have a term like 1 + 3*(...), which can be thought of as 1 + 3*a, where a is the next layer. So, each layer is 1 + 3*a, and if we expand all the layers, we might end up with a sum that's a geometric series. Let me try to expand the innermost layers and see if a pattern emerges. Starting with the innermost: Layer 1: 1 +3 =4 Layer 2:1 +3*(4)=1 +12=13 Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, E=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sum. Let me see: Each time we have a term 1 + 3*(...). Let me try to expand the entire expression step by step. Let me write E as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let's denote the innermost part as starting from 1+3, and each step adds another layer. Let me try to compute each layer step by step again to ensure that I didn't make a mistake. Layer1:1+3=4 Layer2:1+3*4=1+12=13 Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then, E=3*29524=88572. So, it's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, for n=9, we get a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524, and E=3*a_9=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with nine layers.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a recursive formula or a closed-form solution for such a nested expression. Let me think about the general form. Suppose I have an expression like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) with n layers. In this case, a = 1, b = 3, and n = 9. Maybe there's a formula for the nth term. Let me see. Let's consider the general case where each layer is defined as L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_k^h = C*3^k, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_k^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computations. For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer k=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the formula derived from the linear recurrence. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just check once more using the formula. L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for k=9: L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as each layer being 3 times the previous layer plus 1, but I think the recurrence approach is solid. Let me just check if 3^10 is indeed 59049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, (3^{10} -1)/2 is indeed 59048/2=29524.

So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let me see. Each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent as well. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern in the layers without computing each one. Since each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and we've found that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, regardless of the approach, the answer seems to be 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with the exponents. 3^10 is 59049, right? Let me compute 3^10 step by step: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3: 29524*3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution. Let's find the particular solution. Assume a_n = C, then substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 =81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. But wait, actually, the innermost part is Layer 1, which is 1 + 3, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), and so on up to Layer9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8). So, E is 3*(Layer9). But Layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, so E=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it directly, using the formula. So, that confirms the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer. 2. Compute each layer step by step, which took me through 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. 3. After computing the 9th layer, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 4. Alternatively, recognize the recurrence relation and solve it using the formula for a linear recurrence, which gave me a direct computation method, leading to the same answer. 5. Cross-verified both methods to ensure consistency. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built upon the previous one. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier. So, if I can find a formula for a_n, I can compute a_9 directly without calculating each layer. Let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my previous calculation. So, using the closed-form formula, I can compute the result without manually calculating each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. I think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Let me just double-check my arithmetic to be sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from a_1 to a_9: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Each step seems correct: each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that all checks out. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. This pattern continues up to the ninth layer. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, the ninth layer is found to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the problem has 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^10=59049, subtract 1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's consistent.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, so 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.

    "text": " Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So 27000+2400=29400+123=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. So Layer 9: 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*29524. As computed earlier, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Then, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern for the entire expression. Let me denote the entire expression as E. E =3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) Let me see how many layers there are. Each time, it's 1 +3(...). There are 9 layers inside the first 3(...). So, E =3*(L_9) where L_9 is as computed. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for E_n, where E_n is 3*(L_n). Given that L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then E_n =3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, E_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then E_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get to the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked enough to be confident that this is correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm ready to present the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523=29524. Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It seems similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. Wait, perhaps it's a geometric series where each term is 3^n. Let me consider that.\n\nIf I have n layers, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_k as the value of the k-th layer, then L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nGiven L_1 = 4, let's plug in k=1: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4.\n\nWe can also look for a steady-state solution. As k increases, the term A*3^k will dominate unless A=0. But perhaps we can find a particular solution.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, we can write:\n\nL_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_k^h = C*3^k.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_k^p = D, a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer k, L_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check with k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nk=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nk=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is building a number in base 3. Let me see: The innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4. The next layer is 1 + 3*(4) =13, which is like 1*3^2 + 3*3^1 + 1*3^0? Wait, 13 in base 10 is equal to 111 in base 3, which is 1*9 + 1*3 + 1*1=13. Similarly, layer 3 is 40, which is 1*27 + 1*9 + 1*3 +1*1=40. Wait, 40 in base 3 is 1111, because 1*27 + 1*9 +1*3 +1*1=40. So, each layer k corresponds to a number with k+1 ones in base 3. So, layer 1: 4=11(base3)=1*3 +1=4. Layer 2:13=111(base3)=1*9 +1*3 +1=13. Layer3:40=1111(base3)=1*27 +1*9 +1*3 +1=40. So, layer 9 would be 111111111(base3). Which is 3^9 +3^8 +...+3^0. The sum of a geometric series from 3^0 to 3^9 is (3^{10} -1)/(3-1)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is exactly what we had for L_9. Therefore, L_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize the pattern as a base-3 number, I end up with the same result. That makes me confident that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer1:4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nMultiply by 3:29524*3=88572.\n\nYep, that's consistent. So I think I'm good.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. Let me think about it. Let's define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression. Let me denote the innermost term as x. So starting from the innermost: x = 1 + 3. Then, moving out, the next term is 1 + 3x. Then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3x) = 1 + 3 + 9x. Then the next would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9x) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27x. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, the constants are adding up as powers of 3, and the coefficients of x are also powers of 3. So, perhaps each layer n contributes 3^{n} as a coefficient. Let me see:\n\nLet me try to write the expression for a_9 using the closed-form formula. As we saw earlier, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 -3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So that's another way to get the same result, which confirms the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. Let me see if I can model this as such. Let me consider the expression E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))) with nine layers. Let me denote E_n as the expression with n layers. Then, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12. E_2 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4)=3*(13)=39. Wait, but earlier, when I computed layer 2, it was 13, but E_2 would be 3*(13)=39. Hmm, but in my previous approach, I computed up to a_9=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So perhaps E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), with E_1=3*(1+3)=12. Let's see: E_1=12, E_2=3*(1 + E_1)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39. E_3=3*(1 + E_2)=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120. Wait, but earlier, when I computed up to a_3=40, then E_3=3*40=120. Hmm, so E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), starting with E_1=12. So, perhaps we can solve this recurrence relation as well. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence is E_n = 3 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1=12. Let me solve this. The homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume E_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3 + 3*A => A - 3A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2. So the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 3/2. Applying the initial condition E_1=12: 12 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 12 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 13.5 => C = 4.5 = 9/2. So, E_n = (9/2)*3^n - 3/2 = (9*3^n -3)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. Let me check for n=1: E_1=(3^{3} -3)/2=(27 -3)/2=24/2=12. Correct. For n=2: E_2=(81 -3)/2=78/2=39. Correct. For n=3: E_3=(243 -3)/2=240/2=120. Correct. So, for n=9, E_9=(3^{11} -3)/2=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result, which matches what I obtained earlier. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go back to layer 8: a_8=9841. Then, a_9=1 + 3*a_8=1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Let me compute 3*29524 again to verify. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Correct. So, yes, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the innermost parentheses and see if I can express the entire expression as a sum. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand each multiplication, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try that. Let me denote the innermost as layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Similarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40. As I did before, but perhaps I can see a pattern in terms of powers of 3. Let me write each a_n in terms of powers of 3. a1 = 1 + 3 = 3^1 + 1? Wait, no, 3^1=3, so 1 + 3=4=3 +1. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, let's see:\n\na1 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1.\n\na2 = 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 3*(3 +1) +1 = 3^2 + 3 +1.\n\na3 = 40 = 3*13 +1 = 3*(3^2 +3 +1) +1 = 3^3 +3^2 +3 +1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, a3=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1.\n\nSimilarly, a4=1 +3*a3=1 +3*(3^3 +3^2 +3 +1)=1 +3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3.\n\nSo, a4=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3 +1.\n\nSimilarly, a5=1 +3*a4=1 +3*(3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3 +1)=1 +3^5 +3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3.\n\nSo, a5=3^5 +3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3 +1.\n\nI see a pattern here. Each a_n is equal to the sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=n+1, plus 1. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, a1=4=3^1 +1=3 +1=4.\n\na2=13=3^2 +3 +1=9 +3 +1=13.\n\na3=40=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1=27 +9 +3 +1=40.\n\na4=121=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3 +1=81 +27 +9 +3 +1=121.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed a4, I got 121, which is correct. So, each a_n is the sum from k=1 to k=n+1 of 3^k, but actually, the sum from k=0 to k=n+1 of 3^k minus 1, because 3^0=1, so sum from k=0 to m of 3^k = (3^{m+1} -1)/2. Therefore, sum from k=1 to m of 3^k = (3^{m+1} -1)/2 -1 = (3^{m+1} -3)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_n seems to be the sum from k=1 to k=n+1 of 3^k. Wait, for a1, n=1, sum from k=1 to 2 of 3^k=3 +9=12, which is not equal to a1=4. So perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to see that a_n = sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Let me check:\n\na1=4. sum from k=0 to1 of 3^k=1 +3=4. Correct.\n\na2=13. sum from k=0 to2 of 3^k=1 +3 +9=13. Correct.\n\na3=40. sum from k=0 to3 of 3^k=1 +3 +9 +27=40. Correct.\n\na4=121. sum from k=0 to4 of 3^k=1 +3 +9 +27 +81=121. Correct.\n\nSo, a_n = sum from k=0 to n of 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that's exactly the formula I derived earlier! So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: expanding step by step and solving the recurrence relation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time we're adding a term that's a power of 3, starting from 3^1 up to 3^{10}, because the innermost term is 1 +3, which is 3^1 +1, and each subsequent layer adds the next power of 3.\n\nWait, but actually, the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is equal to (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is exactly what a_n is. So, the nth layer a_n is equal to the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is a_9, which is the sum up to 3^9, and then we multiply that by 3, which effectively adds another power of 3, making it 3^{10}.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 is sum from k=0 to9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2=(3^{11} -3)/2=177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nSo, all these methods converge to the same answer, which makes me confident that it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use induction to prove that a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nBase case: n=1, a1=4. (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nAssume a_{k}=(3^{k+1} -1)/2. Then, a_{k+1}=1 +3*a_k=1 +3*(3^{k+1} -1)/2=1 + (3^{k+2} -3)/2= (2 +3^{k+2} -3)/2=(3^{k+2} -1)/2. Which is the formula for a_{k+1}. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all n>=1.\n\nThus, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this problem from multiple angles, and each time I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By iteratively computing each layer up to the ninth layer and then multiplying the result by 3, we find the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**\nThe computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c can be found using the formula. In this case, k=3 and c=1. The closed-form solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(k-1))*(k^n - 1). Wait, let me check that. The standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*k^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = k*a_p + c => a_p - k*a_p = c => a_p*(1 - k) = c => a_p = c/(1 - k). So the general solution is a_n = A*k^n + a_p. Using the initial condition, say n=0, a_0 = 1 + 3*... Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So maybe n starts at 1. Let's see. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the number of layers. There are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), so n=9. So, using the formula, a_n = (c/(k-1))*(k^n - 1). Here, c=1, k=3, so a_n = (1/(3-1))*(3^n -1) = (1/2)*(3^n -1). So, a_9 = (1/2)*(3^9 -1). Let's compute that. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 So, a_9 = (1/2)*(19683 -1) = (1/2)*19682 = 9841. Wait, but earlier when I computed layer 9, I got 29524. Wait, that's inconsistent. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step computation. Let me check again. Wait, in the formula, a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so for n=1, a_1=4, which is 1 + 3*1. But according to the formula, a_n = (1/2)*(3^n -1). For n=1, that would be (1/2)*(3 -1)=1, which is not equal to 4. So, perhaps the formula isn't directly applicable here because the initial condition is different. Wait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. The standard linear recurrence is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, with a_0 = some initial value. In our case, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, if I consider n starting at 1, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc., up to a_9. The formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(k-1))*(k^n - k^{n - m}) ), but maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, let's compute a few terms to see if there's a pattern. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, according to this, a_9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. But according to the formula I thought of earlier, a_n = (1/2)*(3^n -1), which gives a_9 = (1/2)*(19683 -1)=9841, which doesn't match my step-by-step result. So, where is the mistake here? Let me check the formula again. The standard solution for a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_0 - (c/(k-1)))*k^n + (c/(k-1)). So, if I set a_0 as the initial term, which in this case would be a_1 = 4. Wait, but the formula assumes that the recurrence starts at n=0. So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me try to model this correctly. Let's define the recurrence as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, for n >= 2, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. To find a closed-form, let's solve the recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, which matches. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my step-by-step computation earlier. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using exponentiation. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's similar to a geometric series. Let me see: Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this, we get a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. But in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3*1. So, perhaps a_1 = 1 + 3*1, a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*1) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*1, and so on. So, in general, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but that sum is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the closed-form we derived earlier. So, for a_9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which is correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think I'm confident with this answer now. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. The problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Each layer can be computed step by step, starting from the innermost. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation gives the same result. Then, the entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer, which is 3*29524 = 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1=1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, a_3=1+3a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see. Alternatively, since it's a linear recurrence relation, we can solve it as follows. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, whose solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula holds. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without computing each layer, but in this case, since the number of layers isn't too big, computing each step is manageable. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, let me just check my multiplication again: 29524 * 3. 29524 times 3. Let me compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous layer, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. So Layer 9: 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to compute each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >=2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form expression is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let's see: The original expression is 3*(...), and inside, the innermost is 1+3, so that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around, so the outermost Layer 9 is multiplied by 3. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute that: First, compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Then, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, that's consistent with what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3))...)). If I expand it all out, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms, but actually, since each layer is nested, the number of terms is 9. Wait, no, actually, each time you go a layer out, you multiply by another 3. So, the total expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me try to write it as a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3))...)). Let me see how many 1's there are. Each time you go a layer in, you add a 1. So, starting from the innermost 1+3, each layer adds another 1. So, with 9 layers, how many 1's are there? Let me count: Each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer1:1 +3. Then Layer2:1 +3*(Layer1). So, Layer2 has one more 1. Similarly, Layer3:1 +3*(Layer2), another 1. So, Layer n has n 1's? Wait, no, actually, each layer has one 1, but the nesting increases the number of multiplications. Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think of the expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to expand E step by step. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me expand the innermost first: Start with the innermost 1+3=4. Then, moving out: 1 +3*4=13. Then, 1 +3*13=40. Then, 1 +3*40=121. Then, 1 +3*121=364. Then, 1 +3*364=1093. Then, 1 +3*1093=3280. Then, 1 +3*3280=9841. Then, 1 +3*9841=29524. Then, E=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with the earlier computations. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and we have 9 layers, perhaps we can model this as a geometric series. Let me think: Each time, you have a term that's 3^k, where k is the number of layers. Wait, but in our case, the number of layers is 9, so the expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3))) with 9 layers. Let me try to express this as a sum. Let me denote S as the sum inside the outermost parentheses: S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3)) with 8 layers. Then, S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the sum with 7 layers. But this seems recursive, which is similar to the earlier approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see: If I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... +3))). Let's expand this:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... + 3*3*3*...*3*1, where the number of 3's in each term corresponds to the depth of the nesting. Since there are 9 layers, the number of terms would be 9, with the first term being 3^1, the second 3^2, up to 3^9, each multiplied by 1. Wait, but let's see:\n\nWait, actually, each time you go a layer in, you multiply by another 3. So, the innermost term is 1+3, then the next layer is 1 +3*(1+3), which is 1 +3*4=13. Then, the next layer is 1 +3*13=40, and so on. So, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the nth layer, then L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nAs I found earlier, L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Therefore, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, E=3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of E as 3*(L_9), and L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then E=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to see it: E=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nSo, that's a more efficient way, using the closed-form expression. So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponents: 3^{11}=3*3^10=3*59049=177147. Correct. Then, 177147-3=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, all methods point to the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I computed each layer step by step, then found a closed-form formula, and both gave the same result. Additionally, thinking of it as a geometric series also led me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we recognize a pattern where each layer is defined as $L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}$, starting from the innermost layer.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that approach. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches. Great, so the formula works. So, layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = (177144)/2 =88572. Which matches the earlier computation. So, that's a more efficient way using the recurrence relation. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step, that also worked. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, layer 9 is the outermost one, which is then multiplied by 3. So, yeah, 9 layers, so n=9. So, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =59049 -1=59048 /2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.

So, I think that's the right answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Thus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, same result. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Therefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.

    "text": " Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed in terms of geometric series or recursively. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. That's a recursive formula. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution. Let's assume L_p = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3^{10} directly and then apply the formula. Let me check: 3^1 = 3 3^2 =9 3^3=27 3^4=81 3^5=243 3^6=729 3^7=2187 3^8=6561 3^9=19683 3^10=59049 Yes, that's correct. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try that approach. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Let me expand the innermost terms first. Starting from the innermost: Let's denote the innermost expression as E1 =1 +3=4. Then, E2=1 +3*E1=1+12=13. E3=1+3*E2=1+39=40. E4=1+3*E3=1+120=121. E5=1+3*E4=1+363=364. E6=1+3*E5=1+1092=1093. E7=1+3*E6=1+3279=3280. E8=1+3*E7=1+9840=9841. E9=1+3*E8=1+29523=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572. So, same result. Alternatively, is there a way to represent this as a geometric series? Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. So, each E_n =1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric progression but with an added constant. As I did earlier, solving the recurrence relation gives the closed-form solution. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. The entire expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) Let me try to write it out step by step, expanding each layer. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote each nested part as follows:\n\nLet me number the innermost parentheses as step 1, and work my way out. So:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(step1) =1 + 3*4=13\n\nStep3:1 +3*(step2)=1 +3*13=40\n\nStep4:1 +3*(step3)=1 +3*40=121\n\nStep5:1 +3*(step4)=1 +3*121=364\n\nStep6:1 +3*(step5)=1 +3*364=1093\n\nStep7:1 +3*(step6)=1 +3*1093=3280\n\nStep8:1 +3*(step7)=1 +3*3280=9841\n\nStep9:1 +3*(step8)=1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(step9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of powers of 3, but I'm not sure if that would simplify things. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the numbers I'm getting:\n\nLayer 1:4=3+1\n\nLayer2:13=3*4 +1=3*(3+1)+1=3^2 +3 +1\n\nLayer3:40=3*13 +1=3*(3^2 +3 +1)+1=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1\n\nLayer4:121=3*40 +1=3*(3^3 +3^2 +3 +1)+1=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3 +1\n\nI see a pattern here. Each layer L_n =3^{n} +3^{n-1} + ... +3 +1.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLayer1: n=1:3^1 +1=3+1=4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: n=2:3^2 +3^1 +1=9+3+1=13. Correct.\n\nLayer3:n=3:3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1=27+9+3+1=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:n=4:81+27+9+3+1=121. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but that's the sum of a geometric series where each term is 3^k from k=0 to k=n. The sum of a geometric series is (3^{n+1} -1)/(3-1)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it, using the sum of the geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using exponents directly.\n\nBut, in any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me verify a few steps again.\n\nStarting with Layer1=4.\n\nLayer2=1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer3=1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer4=1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer5=1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer6=1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7=1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8=1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9=1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3*29524 in another way.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000.\n\n9000*3=27000.\n\n500*3=1500.\n\n20*3=60.\n\n4*3=12.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 +1500=88500.\n\n88500 +60=88560.\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've checked this thoroughly, and each step seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer from the innermost to the outermost as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\).

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's consider the general form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it: The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this alternative method also confirms the answer. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, it can be expressed as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Wait, no, because a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, so the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, this method also works. Therefore, regardless of the approach, the answer is 88572. So, I think I've confirmed it multiple times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a linear recurrence. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous term) +1. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, etc. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} -1)/(c-1). Wait, in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=3, d=1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + (3^{n} -1)/(3-1). But wait, let me check the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, if n=1, a_1 = 3^{1}*(a_0) + (3^{1} -1)/(3-1) = 3*a0 + (3-1)/2 = 3a0 + 1. We know a1=4, so 3a0 +1=4 \u21d2 3a0=3 \u21d2 a0=1. So, the general formula is a_n = 3^{n}*1 + (3^{n} -1)/2. Simplify that: a_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, that seems familiar. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1: a1=4, layer 2: a2=13, up to layer 9: a9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute a9: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

    "text": " Wait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right, but let me check with another approach. Maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p =1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Each 1+3(...) is a layer, so starting from the innermost, we have Layer 1: 1+3, Layer 2:1+3(Layer1), up to Layer 9:1+3(Layer8). So, n=9 for the innermost layer. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. First, compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Then, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. So, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can express the entire expression as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By working from the innermost layer outward, each layer is computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows the use of a formula to find the value of each layer efficiently. The final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer from the inside out**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln. Let's see. The recurrence is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is typically of the form Ln = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence. The homogeneous solution is when we set Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4. When n=1, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches L2=13. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches L3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, Ln = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to see this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric series, but nested. Alternatively, if I consider that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), which is a continued fraction-like structure, but with multiplication and addition. However, the way I solved it by expanding each layer seems to have worked, and the general formula using the recurrence relation also gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula. Let's see, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so the homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 is 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. It might have saved time if I had recognized the pattern earlier, but either way, the result is the same. Let me just confirm the multiplication again to be sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a formula, and double-checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in the initial condition to find A and B. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. Let me assume that after n steps, the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4 = 3A + B = 3A - 1/2. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works.
