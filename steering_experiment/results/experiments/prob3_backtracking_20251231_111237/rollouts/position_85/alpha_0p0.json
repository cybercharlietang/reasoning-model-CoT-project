    "text": " Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. Substituting into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1 So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1 Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have computed each layer step by step as I did before, and it also gives the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. Here, c = 1, r = 3. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + a_0, but wait, let me check. Wait, actually, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^n, and the particular solution is a constant since c is constant. Let me try to find the particular solution. Assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Hmm, but that seems odd because our a_n are all positive integers. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as before. So, the closed-form formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me test that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The general solution for a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^{n} - 1) + a_0. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is the first term after the initial condition. Wait, maybe the initial term is a_0 = 1. Let me see: If a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. Then, the formula would be a_n = (1/(3 - 1))*(3^{n+1} - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=0: a_0 = (3^{1} -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, correct. For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, correct. So, yes, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, that's another way to approach it, using the formula for the linear recurrence. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check once more by computing a few layers using the formula to make sure. For example, a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, which matches. a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364, which also matches. So, the formula works, and therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, which might have been faster, but since it's only nine layers, step-by-step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps, but since it's only nine terms, it's probably faster to compute each one as I did. Alternatively, noticing that each a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me see if that formula holds. Let me test it with the layers I computed. For n=1: a1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but wait, our a1 is 4, not 1. So that formula doesn't apply here. Alternatively, perhaps a different formula. Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the final step is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start, recognizing the pattern, but since I was able to compute it step by step, and the formula confirmed the result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's define each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on, up to L_9. So, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. I think that's solid. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute the first few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, indeed, each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is of the form a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution will have a homogeneous and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is our Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using the formula. Let's see: The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula instead of expanding each layer. That might be faster for larger expressions. But since in this problem there are only nine layers, computing step by step isn't too bad. Anyway, both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated 9 times, resulting in the outermost layer being 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to compute it more efficiently without calculating each layer. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer, where a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1). Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that. Starting from the innermost layer, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, expanding the expression might reveal a geometric series. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step, although that might be tedious given the number of layers. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series could help. Let me consider the expression without the outermost 3. The inner expression is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))... Let's denote the innermost expression as S. Then, S = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*S = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. But this is the same as the layer method I used earlier. So, perhaps the recurrence relation approach is the most straightforward here. Either way, the result is consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's see. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me try to find a recurrence relation here. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using exponentiation. Since each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's similar to 3^9 + 3^8 + ... + 3^0, but I need to check. Wait, but in this case, each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 is (3^{10}-1)/2, as we found. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a certain sequence. Let me see: Each layer n is defined as a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1)=4. So, let's see if there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form for a linear recurrence like a(n) = k*a(n-1) + c is a geometric series. The solution is a(n) = c*(k^(n) - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, let me think again. The recurrence is a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1)=4. Let me write down the terms:\n\na(1) = 4\na(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, the general formula for such a recurrence is a(n) = (3^(n) - 1)/2. Wait, let me check if that works.\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but a(1) is 4, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the general formula. Let me try to derive it.\n\nGiven a(n) = 1 + 3*a(n-1), with a(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a(n) = 3*a(n-1), whose solution is a_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_p(n) = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a(n) = a_h(n) + a_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo the general formula is a(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a(1)=4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches a(2)=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is a(3)=40.\n\nSo the formula works.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that could be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), assuming a \u2260 1. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. So, L_n = 3^n * L_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, L_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, perhaps L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0, where L_0 would be 1? Wait, let's check: If n=1: L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0. If L_0 = 1, then L_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches. So, L_0 = 1, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, etc. So, using the formula, L_n = 3^n * L_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Plugging in L_0 = 1, this becomes L_n = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2. Let me simplify that: L_n = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers we computed. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the entire original expression in terms of a single formula without computing each layer. Let me see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer is built as 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if we denote the innermost layer as L_1 =1 +3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 +3*(...). So, with nine layers, we have L_9 as computed. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9. Alternatively, if I think of it as a geometric series, perhaps. Let me consider expanding the expression. Let me try to write out the entire expression step by step, expanding each layer:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nE = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1's and 3's. Wait, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), so each layer adds another 1 and another 3. But perhaps it's better to think recursively. Alternatively, maybe I can express E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer beyond the first adds another 1 +3*(...). So, perhaps E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me see if I can express this as a sum. Let me try to expand the innermost parentheses first.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 =4\n\nNext layer: 1 +3*4=13\n\nNext:1 +3*13=40\n\nNext:1 +3*40=121\n\nNext:1 +3*121=364\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1093\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula I derived earlier, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, E=3*L_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to see.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me denote the innermost part as x. Wait, but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each time, the expression is 1 +3*something, and that something is similar to the previous expression.\n\nWait, but given that each layer is 1 +3*(next layer), and we have nine layers, perhaps the expression can be represented as E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with nine 1's and nine 3's. Hmm, but actually, each opening parenthesis has a corresponding 1 +3*... So, the number of layers is nine, meaning that the expression has nine instances of 1 +3*(...). So, perhaps the total expression can be represented as E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) which is nine layers. Therefore, using the formula we have, E=3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=3*(59049-1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3^k, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but given that each layer is just 1 + 3*(previous layer), and it's only 9 layers deep, computing each layer step by step seems manageable. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, in general, for such a recurrence relation, the solution can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + r^{n} * a_0, but wait, actually, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*r^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = r*K + c => K - r*K = c => K*(1 - r) = c => K = c/(1 - r). So the general solution is a_n = A*r^n + c/(1 - r). Applying initial condition a_0: a_0 = A + c/(1 - r) => A = a_0 - c/(1 - r). Therefore, a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - r)) * r^n + c/(1 - r). Alternatively, sometimes written as a_n = a_0*r^n + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, perhaps that's a better way to express it. Let me verify with n=1: a_1 = a_0*r + c. So using the formula a_n = a_0*r^n + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). For n=1: a_1 = a_0*r + c*(r - 1)/(r - 1) = a_0*r + c. Which matches. So, yes, that formula should work. In our case, a_1 = 4, but actually, in the problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the number of terms is 9, starting from a_1. Wait, perhaps I should adjust the indices. Let me define a_1 as the innermost layer, so a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is what I computed earlier. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, using the formula, a_n = a_1*r^{n-1} + c*(r^{n-1} - 1)/(r - 1). Wait, let me see: the formula is a_n = a_0*r^n + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). But in our case, a_1 is given, so perhaps I need to adjust the formula accordingly. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the number of layers. Let me think: the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, then a_2, a_3, ..., up to a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3. So, n=9. So, using the formula, a_n = a_1*r^{n-1} + c*(r^{n-1} - 1)/(r - 1). Plugging in the values: a_1 = 4, r=3, c=1, n=9. So, a_9 = 4*3^{8} + 1*(3^{8} - 1)/(3 - 1). Let me compute that. First, 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, 3^8=6561. Then, a_9 = 4*6561 + (6561 - 1)/2. Compute each part: 4*6561: 4*6000=24000, 4*561=2244, so total is 24000 + 2244 = 26244. Next, (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. So, a_9 = 26244 + 3280 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked using both the step-by-step computation and the formula for the linear recurrence, and both gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1, each subsequent layer is a function of the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each layer follows the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n to avoid computing each layer step by step. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier to see if it's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, we can compute L_9 directly without computing each layer, which might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing step by step was manageable. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the final multiplication step. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost value before multiplying by 3. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm the result efficiently. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me check a couple of the layers again. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 was 13, so 3*13=39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. 3*40=120, plus 1=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. 3*121=363, plus 1=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. 3*364=1092, plus 1=1093. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be thought of as a geometric series. Let me consider the general form. Suppose I have a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the layers are a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., as I computed before. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers. So, the innermost layer is layer 1: a_1=4. Then each subsequent layer up to layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let me compute a_9 first. a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the formula approach confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation formula\u2014give the same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each time there's a 1 + 3(, which is 9 times. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, yes, 9 layers. So, my computation of layers 1 to 9 is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without manually calculating each layer. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let's try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads us to the same result. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is building a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand the entire expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be seen as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but wait, that might not be accurate because each term is 1 multiplied by 3^{n}, but let me see. Wait, actually, the expansion would be more complex because each 1 is being multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Let's denote the innermost expression as E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 =1 + 3*13=40. E4 =1 +3*40=121. E5=1 +3*121=364. E6=1 +3*364=1093. E7=1 +3*1093=3280. E8=1 +3*3280=9841. E9=1 +3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9=88572. Alternatively, if I consider the expansion, each layer adds a term of 3^n. Let me see: E1=4=3+1=3^1 +1? Wait, no. E1=1+3=4=3^1 +1. E2=1+3*4=1+12=13=3^2 + 4? Wait, 3^2=9, 9+4=13. Hmm, but 4 is E1. So, E2=1 +3*E1=1 +3*4=13, which is 3^2 + 3^1 + 1? Wait, 9 +3 +1=13. Yes, that's true. E3=1 +3*E2=1 +3*13=40. Let's see: 3^3=27, 3^2=9, 3^1=3, 3^0=1. 27 +9 +3 +1=40. Yes, that's correct. So, E3=3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +3^0=40. Similarly, E4=1 +3*E3=1 +3*40=121. Let's see: 3^4=81, 3^3=27, 3^2=9, 3^1=3, 3^0=1. Sum:81+27+9+3+1=121. Yes, that's correct. So, it seems that each En is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, but En = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is the formula for the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, from k=0 to n. Because the sum of 3^0 +3^1 +...+3^n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, that's why the closed-form formula works. Therefore, E9 = sum from k=0 to9 of 3^k = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to see it. So, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation, or recognizing the geometric series\u2014we arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods: computing each layer step by step and solving the recurrence relation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit: 29524\nx    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2. So, 88572. Yep, that's correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on. So in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for the entire expression without computing each layer. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. So, if I denote the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with eight layers inside. Wait, but that might not directly help because each layer is similar but not exactly the same. Alternatively, using the formula we found earlier, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then E=3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to get the answer without computing each layer step by step, which might be faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But since there are only nine layers, computing each step by step isn't too bad. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check my computations again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Starting with the layers: 1. 1+3=4 2. 1+3*4=13 3. 1+3*13=40 4. 1+3*40=121 5. 1+3*121=364 6. 1+3*364=1093 7. 1+3*1093=3280 8. 1+3*3280=9841 9. 1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Each step seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula: E= (3^{11} -3)/2= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the final result by 3 to get the answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could save time, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That's a recursive relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, actually, in our case, L_1 was 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*L_{previous}. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., as we computed before. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Here, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}. The characteristic equation is r = 3*r, which has a solution r = 0, but that's trivial. Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Then, we look for a particular solution, L_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's a good check. Therefore, the final value before multiplying by 3 is 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if we wanted to express the entire computation using the formula, since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost layer is L_9, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, using the formula. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. So, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, we arrived at the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series. Let me see: Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from L1 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. This seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, what is the initial condition? Wait, in our case, Layer 1 is L1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1. So, L1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series but nested. Maybe I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed before. Then, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the value inside the outermost 3*(... ) is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524=88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression seems to be of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me consider a general approach. Suppose I have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation. First, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => Subtract a_p from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => 2*a_p = -1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer before the final multiplication is 29524.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer can be represented as a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, no: a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, the value is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the formula. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the innermost layer is a_1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is as computed. Since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can notice a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9) where a_9 is as above. So, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula using the recurrence relation lead to the same result.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0, if we consider L_0, it would be 1 + 3*L_{-1}, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a pattern by computing the first few terms. Let me list the layers again: L1 = 4 = 3 + 1 L2 = 13 = 9 + 4 L3 = 40 = 27 + 13 L4 = 121 = 81 + 40 L5 = 364 = 243 + 121 L6 = 1093 = 729 + 364 L7 = 3280 = 2187 + 1093 L8 = 9841 = 6561 + 3280 L9 = 29524 = 19683 + 9841 Hmm, I notice that each L_n is equal to 3^{n} + L_{n-1}. Wait, but that might not be accurate. Wait, let me check: For L2: 3^2 = 9, and L2 = 13 = 9 + 4, which is 3^2 + L1. Similarly, L3 = 3^3 + L2: 27 + 13 = 40. L4 = 3^4 + L3: 81 + 40 = 121. Yes, this seems to hold. So, in general, L_n = 3^n + L_{n-1}. But since L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can see that 3^n + L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which implies that 3^n = 1 + 2*L_{n-1}. Wait, that might not be correct because 3^n + L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} implies that 3^n = 1 + 2*L_{n-1}. Hmm, perhaps this isn't the most straightforward approach. Alternatively, let's consider the recurrence L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3 * L9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula instead of computing each layer step by step. It's good to cross-verify using different methods to ensure the answer is correct. I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized without computing each layer. Let me think. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's assume L_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Simplifying: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I went through each step, computed each layer, and then also found a general formula to verify the result.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be solved using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if that applies here. Let's denote the innermost expression as x. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3x. So, if I have n layers, the value would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...))). In this case, n=9 layers, but since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), it's like a recursive sequence. Let me define it as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1} for k >= 2, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_k, that might be faster than computing each layer step by step. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when k=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, as before. For k=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3 each time, so the entire expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try that approach as a cross-check. Starting from the innermost layer, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, actually, each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, maybe it's better to express it as a geometric series. Let me denote the innermost term as t_1 =1 + 3 =4. Then t_2=1 + 3*t_1=1 + 3*4=13, and so on. As we saw, t_k =1 + 3*t_{k-1}, which is the same recurrence as before. So, using the formula t_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2, as before. So, the total expression is 3*t_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think I'm confident with this answer now. So, the steps are: 1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, starting with 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(previous result), etc. 3. Alternatively, use the recurrence relation to find a general formula for the k-th layer, which turns out to be (3^{k+1} -1)/2. 4. Compute the 9th layer using this formula, then multiply by 3 to get the final result. 5. Verify using another method, such as recognizing it as a geometric series, to ensure consistency. All methods lead to the same final answer, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me define the expression as E(n), where n is the number of layers. So, E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, the total expression is 3*E(9). So, E(1) = 4 E(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 E(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 E(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 E(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 E(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 E(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 E(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 E(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*E(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E(n). Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is E(n) = 3*E(n-1) + 1, with E(1) = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is E(n) = 3*E(n-1), whose solution is E(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say E_p. Plugging into the recurrence: E_p = 3*E_p + 1 => E_p - 3*E_p = 1 => -2*E_p = 1 => E_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is E(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition E(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is E(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: E(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: E(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, E(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have E(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*E(9) = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 = 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It looks like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on up to a9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might help. Let's see: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. So, 3*a9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let's try to find a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let's see: If I expand the expression, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the innermost term is 3*1, then each layer adds another 3*1. But wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, maybe the entire expression can be represented as a sum where each term is 3^k. Let me try to expand it. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me try to write it as E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Wait, is that correct? Let me see: Starting from the innermost, which is 3, then each layer adds another 3 times that. So, maybe it's a sum of 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Let me check: The innermost is 3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*3 = 1 + 9 = 10? Wait, no, that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps my initial thought is incorrect. Let me think again. Wait, no, when I expand the expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, when I multiply out, each 1 contributes a term that is multiplied by 3^k for some k. Let me try to expand step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote the innermost as a1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but if I expand a3, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*(1 + 9) = 1 + 3*10 = 1 + 30 = 31? Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in expanding. Wait, no, when I compute a2, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, a3 is 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, expanding a3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3*(13) = 40. So, each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the previous layer. So, if I expand a3, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3*(13) = 40.\n\nSimilarly, a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nIf I expand a4, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*13) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nSo, each time, when I expand, I'm adding another 3 multiplied by the previous layers. So, in the end, when I expand the entire expression E = 3*a9, I think it's equivalent to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). So, when I expand all the layers, each 1 contributes a term that's multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers from that 1 to the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each 1 inside contributes 3^k, where k is the number of times it's multiplied by 3. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3 eight times (since there are nine layers, but the innermost is at the ninth layer, so it's multiplied by 3^8). Similarly, the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let's think of the expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))).\n\nIf I expand this, each 1 inside will be multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers it's nested within.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1, which is in the ninth layer, it's multiplied by 3^8, because each layer above multiplies by another 3. Then, the next 1 is in the eighth layer, so it's multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the 1 in the first layer (the outermost) being multiplied by 3^0 = 1.\n\nSo, the entire expression would be E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))).\n\nBut wait, actually, when we expand E, it's 3*(a9), where a9 = 1 + 3*a8, and so on. So, in terms of the expansion, E = 3*a9 = 3*(1 + 3*a8) = 3*1 + 3*3*a8 = 3 + 3^2*a8.\n\nBut a8 = 1 + 3*a7, so E = 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a7) = 3 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*a7.\n\nContinuing this way, each time we substitute a_n, we add another term with a higher power of 3.\n\nSo, ultimately, E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check with a smaller number of layers.\n\nSuppose we have E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). So, two layers.\n\nCompute it step by step: Innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, using the sum formula: 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 3 + 9 + 27 = 39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, with three layers: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it properly.\n\nWait, with three layers: Innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, E = 3*13 = 39. But according to the sum formula, it should be 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 39. Correct. Wait, but in the case of three layers, the sum is 3 + 9 + 27 = 39, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, with four layers: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))).\n\nCompute step by step: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Next: E = 3*40 = 120.\n\nUsing the sum formula: 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, for n layers, E = 3*(a_n) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n+1}.\n\nWait, but in the four layers example, n=4, the sum was up to 3^4=81, which is four terms. Wait, but in the problem, we have nine layers, so the sum would be from 3^1 up to 3^9, which is nine terms.\n\nWait, but in the four layers example, the sum was 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 = sum from k=1 to 4 of 3^k.\n\nSimilarly, in the problem, which has nine layers, the sum would be from 3^1 to 3^9.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the expression is E = 3*a9, and a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, E = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, but let me compute the sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k.\n\nThe sum S = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9.\n\nThis is a geometric series with first term a=3, ratio r=3, and n=9 terms.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1).\n\nSo, S = 3*(3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3*(19683 - 1)/2 = 3*(19682)/2 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier calculation, E = 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut according to the sum S, we have S = 29523, which is different.\n\nWait, that suggests a discrepancy. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the four layers example, E = 3*(a4) = 3*(1 + 3*a3) = 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*(121) = 363.\n\nBut according to the sum formula, sum from k=1 to 4 of 3^k = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120, which is different from 363.\n\nWait, so my earlier assumption that E is equal to the sum from k=1 to n of 3^k is incorrect. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the sum formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when I expanded E for the four layers, I saw that E = 3*a4 = 3*(1 + 3*a3) = 3 + 3*3*a3 = 3 + 3^2*a3.\n\nBut a3 = 1 + 3*a2, so E = 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a2) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a2.\n\nContinuing, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, so E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*(1 + 3*a1) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4*a1.\n\nBut a1 = 1 + 3, so E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4*(1 + 3) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5.\n\nWait, but in the four layers example, when I computed E step by step, I got 120, which is equal to 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 120, which is the sum up to 3^4. But according to this expansion, E would be 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^4 + 3^5. Wait, that's a sum up to 3^5, which is 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 = 363, which is the same as 3*a4 = 363. So, in this case, E = sum from k=1 to 5 of 3^k = 363.\n\nWait, so in the four layers case, E = sum from k=1 to 5 of 3^k, which is 363, matching our step-by-step calculation. So, the number of terms in the sum is n+1, where n is the number of layers. So, for nine layers, E would be sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have nine layers, so E = sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k. Let me compute that.\n\nThe sum S = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^10.\n\nUsing the geometric series formula: S = 3*(3^10 - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation of E = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the expression E is equal to the sum from k=1 to 10 of 3^k, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a=3, r=3, n=10 terms. So, S = 3*(3^10 - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the answer.\n\nIn summary, by computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. Additionally, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allowed me to compute it using the sum formula, which gave the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\) and each subsequent layer is computed as \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer:\n   - \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n   - \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n   - \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n   - \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n   - \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n   - \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n   - \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n   - \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. Multiply the result by 3:\n   - \\( 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nWe can also verify this using the sum of a geometric series. The expression can be expanded as a sum of powers of 3:\n\\[ E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + \\ldots + 3^{10} \\]\n\nUsing the geometric series sum formula:\n\\[ S = a \\frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \\]\nwhere \\( a = 3 \\), \\( r = 3 \\), and \\( n = 10 \\):\n\\[ S = 3 \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{3 - 1} = 3 \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

That seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to find a pattern or solve the recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition: When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. So, L9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(L9), and L9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=3*59049=177147. Therefore, the expression is (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's another way to compute it, using exponents directly. So, regardless of the method, the result is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same answer.

That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we have L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to L_9. Then the total expression is 3*L_9. Maybe there's a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to find a pattern.

Wait, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524... I think these are related to the powers of 3 or something similar.

Hmm, 4 is L1.\n\nWait, 3^2 + L1=9 +4=13=L2.\n\nSimilarly, L3=40, 3^3=27, 27 +13=40=L3.\n\nSimilarly, L4=121, 3^4=81, 81 +40=121.\n\nAh, so it seems that L_n = 3^{n} + L_{n-1}, with L1=4=3^1 +1.\n\nWait, but 3^1 +1=4, which is L1.\n\nThen L2=3^2 + L1=9 +4=13.\n\nL3=3^3 + L2=27 +13=40.\n\nL4=3^4 + L3=81 +40=121.\n\nYes, that seems to hold. So in general, L_n = 3^n + L_{n-1}, with L1=4.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then L_n = 3^n + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + ... + 3^1 + 1.\n\nWait, but let's see: L1=4=3^1 +1=3+1=4.\n\nL2=3^2 + L1=9 +4=13=3^2 +3^1 +1=9+3+1=13.\n\nWait, no, 3^2 +3^1 +1=9+3+1=13. Similarly, L3=3^3 + L2=27 +13=40=3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +1=27+9+3+1=40.\n\nWait, so L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but starting from k=0? Because 3^0=1, 3^1=3, etc. But L1=4=3+1=3^1 +3^0.\n\nSimilarly, L2=13=9+3+1=3^2 +3^1 +3^0.\n\nWait, so L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, but for n=1, it's sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k=1+3=4.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, sum_{k=0}^{2} 3^k=1+3+9=13.\n\nSo yes, L_n is the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=n of 3^k.\n\nBut wait, in our case, the layers go from L1 to L9, where L1=4, which is the sum up to k=1. So, if L_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, then L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, because the sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1} -1)/(r-1). Here, r=3, so sum = (3^{n+1} -1)/(3-1)= (3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nBut in our case, L1=sum_{k=0}^1 3^k= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is L9, n=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, so that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. So, that's a more efficient method instead of computing each layer step by step. But since I was able to compute each layer manually and arrived at the same result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series multiplied by 3. Let me try that approach.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). So, it's 3 multiplied by a sum where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. As we saw earlier, each layer can be represented as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nBut since we've already established that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer adds another power of 3, it's more straightforward to compute it using the formula.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's try another approach. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me try to express this recursively.\n\nLet me define E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4=12.\n\nE_2 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 2, I had 1 + 3*4=13, and then 3*13=39. But in my initial step-by-step, I had E=3*L9=88572. So, perhaps E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}).\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I was computing L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1=4.\n\nSo, E = 3*L9, where L9=29524, so E=88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I define E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), starting from E_1=3*(1 +3)=12.\n\nThen E_1=12, E_2=3*(1 + E_1)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39.\n\nE_3=3*(1 + E_2)=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120.\n\nE_4=3*(1 + E_3)=3*(1 +120)=3*121=363.\n\nE_5=3*(1 + E_4)=3*(1 +363)=3*364=1092.\n\nE_6=3*(1 + E_5)=3*(1 +1092)=3*1093=3279.\n\nE_7=3*(1 + E_6)=3*(1 +3279)=3*3280=9840.\n\nE_8=3*(1 + E_7)=3*(1 +9840)=3*9841=29523.\n\nE_9=3*(1 + E_8)=3*(1 +29523)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute L_n first and then multiply by 3, or define E_n as 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), I end up with the same final answer of 88572.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, since each L_n is the sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + ... +3^n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then E=3*L9=88572.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method I use, I arrive at the same result. So, I think it's safe to conclude that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll compute the layers again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but given that there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Alternatively, this might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula that could represent this expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer, but since the number of layers is manageable, it's not too bad either way. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: Starting from the innermost: (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first \"1+3(\", each subsequent one adds a layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2.

So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, step-by-step computation is manageable. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have made this faster. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApply initial condition: a_1 =4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4.

Therefore, a_9=29524, and the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2.\n\nBut in our case, n=9, so 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nThis confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough.

So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a geometric series perhaps? Let me consider the general form. Suppose I have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier results. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me try to express the entire original expression in terms of a sum. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me denote the innermost expression as starting from 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). If I unroll the expression, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of 3s. Wait, each layer after the first adds another multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), etc., up to 9 layers. So, perhaps the expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers. But in any case, using the formula we derived earlier, each a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, as we saw. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3^{11} -3 =177147 -3=177144. Then, 177144 /2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step layer computation and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, and so on. So, L1 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula. Let's see. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p(n) = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L(3) = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^k. Let's see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. Using the formula, L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so L(9)= (3^{10}-1)/2. Then, the total expression is 3*L(9)= 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. So, regardless of the method, the result is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but nested. Alternatively, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. I think I've solved it correctly by both iterative computation and by finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern allowed me to find a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which would have been time-consuming, especially if there were more layers.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me recount. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then inside, it's 1 + 3(...). Each time, there's a new layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...\n3. So, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let's write the expression as:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent layer adds another \"1 + 3(\" until the innermost one, which is just 1 + 3. So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3: that's layer 1.\n- Then, each layer wraps around that. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"(\" after the first 3 adds a new layer.

Then inside that, another (1 + 3(...\nContinuing until the last one, which is (1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Let's see:\n\nFrom the start: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(\n3. And so on, until the innermost one.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each \"1 + 3(\" corresponds to a layer, and the innermost is 1 + 3, which doesn't have another \"1 + 3(\" inside it. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances. Let me count them:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first \"1 + 3(\" is at position 2. Then, each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" is nested inside. Let me count each occurrence:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. Then, inside that, another 1 + 3(\n3. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to note that the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then each layer wraps around that, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times you can go inward. Let me try to count the number of layers by the number of parentheses.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(...). The innermost is 1 + 3. So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, there are 9 layers, each adding another 3*(...). Therefore, the formula I used earlier with n=9 is correct. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then 3*a_9=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative approach and the formula give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows a pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we determine that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Applying this formula for n=9 gives the value of the innermost expression, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general formula for such a linear recurrence can be found. Let me recall the formula for a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}. The solution can be expressed as L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1). Wait, let me check that. If we have L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, then it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*b^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the equation: K = a + b*K => K - b*K = a => K*(1 - b) = a => K = a/(1 - b). So, the general solution is L_n = C*b^n + a/(1 - b). Using the initial condition, when n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*b^1 + a/(1 - b). Let me plug in the values: a=1, b=3. So, L_n = C*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition at n=1: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to see this without computing each layer. Since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the expression is 3*L_9, so 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it again. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, which is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using the formula for such a recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution a_n^p = D, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation method gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step. Alternatively, maybe there's a recursive formula here. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's consistent with my earlier computation. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a nested expression? Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's find the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which is correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} =177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here to compute this more efficiently without calculating each layer. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let's model it. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, which would correspond to a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches Layer 2. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Wait, but let me check: Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: a_2 = 13, which is (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. So, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Because n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the outermost layer is reached. Using the recurrence relation approach, we confirm that the value of the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a recursion. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.

Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 40 a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 121 a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 364 a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1093 a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 3280 a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 9841 a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 29524 Then, total expression is 3*a9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, but actually, in the first step, a1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, etc. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear, so we can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Substituting the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. So, we have: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D. Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D. Then, D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what we had earlier.
