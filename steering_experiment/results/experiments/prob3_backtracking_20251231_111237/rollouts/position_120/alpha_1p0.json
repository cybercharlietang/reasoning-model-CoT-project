Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, a_9 = 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I think in terms of the number of layers, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because from the formula: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent.

Similarly, for n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 =81/2 - 1/2 =80/2=40, which is correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2.

    "text": ". Let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13, which also matches. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, and the outermost is Layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Wait, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Let me just make sure that this approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: Each layer adds another 3^n term. Let me try to see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be expanded as 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. Wait, but actually, each time we're adding one more 3. Let me think: If we expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which, when fully expanded, is 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... up to 9 terms. Wait, no, because each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, when you expand, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which would be 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to 9 ones. So, it's a sum of 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9. Wait, but that can't be because when I compute it step by step, I get 88572, which is much larger than the sum of 3^1 to 3^9. Let me compute the sum of 3^1 to 3^9: Sum = 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243 + 729 + 2187 + 6561 + 19683. Let me compute that: 3 + 9 = 12; 12 + 27 = 39; 39 + 81 = 120; 120 + 243 = 363; 363 + 729 = 1092; 1092 + 2187 = 3279; 3279 + 6561 = 9840; 9840 + 19683 = 29523. Wait, that's 29523, which is exactly the value of a_9 before multiplying by 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k). But wait, the sum from k=1 to n of 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. Let me confirm that: Sum = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n = 3*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. So, for n=9, Sum = (3^{10} - 3)/2 = (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523, which matches. Then, the entire expression is 3*29523 = 88569. Wait, but earlier I got 88572. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k is (3^{10} - 3)/2 = 29523. Then, the entire expression is 3*(sum) = 3*29523 = 88569. But when I computed it step by step, I got 88572. So there's a difference of 3. That suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back to the step-by-step computation. Let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut according to the sum approach, it should be 3*(sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*29523 = 88569.\n\nWait, so there's a discrepancy of 3. That suggests that perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of terms is different. Let me count how many times 3 is being multiplied. Each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, when we expand the entire expression, how many 1's are there?\n\nWait, let's think about it. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, we have a 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, when fully expanded, it's 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... up to nine 1's.\n\nWait, no, because each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, the first term is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) = 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(...)) = 3 + 9*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nWait, but that seems to suggest that each layer adds another term. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step.\n\nLet me denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me compute E step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nStart with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut according to the sum approach, the sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k is 29523, and 3*29523 = 88569, which is 3 less than 88572.\n\nSo, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is actually 9, but the sum from k=1 to 9 is 29523, but in our step-by-step, we ended up with 29524, which is one more than 29523.\n\nWait, let me check the step-by-step layers again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, a_9 = 29524, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. So, that's correct.\n\nBut the sum approach gave me Sum = (3^{10} - 3)/2 = 29523.\n\nSo, why is there a difference of 1?\n\nBecause the sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k is 29523, but a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nSo, a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*(3^{9} -1)/2 = 1 + (3^{10} -3)/2 = (2 + 3^{10} -3)/2 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the sum approach was missing something because I thought the entire expression is 3 times the sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k, but actually, it's 3 times a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 gives (3^{11} -3)/2, which is 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree when correctly applied. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by trying to relate it to the sum, but now it makes sense. The key is that each layer is building up a term that is part of a geometric progression, and the closed-form formula helps confirm the result.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\n3^{11} = 177147\n\nSo, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer).

Correct. a_2: (3/2)*3^2 - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Which matches my earlier calculation. Similarly, a_3: (3/2)*27 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Because (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2, which is the same as above. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, using both methods, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which can be thought of as building up a sum where each term is a power of 3. Specifically, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another term in the form of 3^k. Let me think: The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9. The next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Wait, that seems to be a pattern: Each layer adds the next power of 3. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^0 + 3^1\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n...\nSo, Layer n: 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, Layer 1 was 4, which is 3^0 + 3^1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2 was 13, which is 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Layer 3 was 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. So yes, each layer n is the sum of 3^0 up to 3^n. So, in general, Layer n: sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k.\n\nBut wait, the sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} r^k = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, so sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier. Therefore, Layer 9 would be sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression as 3*(sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

So, a_9 = 59049/2 -1/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so it's similar to a geometric progression with each term being 3 times the previous plus 1. But since I already have the closed-form, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of the closed-form. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above. So, 3*a_9 = 3*( (3^{10})/2 -1/2 ) = (3^{11})/2 - 3/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3*a_9 = 177147/2 - 3/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer.

Similarly, n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Then, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2.

Therefore, a_9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I think about the number of layers, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each layer is building upon the previous one, and since there are 9 layers, the computation is manageable step by step, as I did earlier. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1, we can model it as a geometric series with common ratio 3, but since each term is 1 + 3*previous, it's a bit different. However, the recurrence approach worked well, giving a closed-form solution, which confirmed the step-by-step computation. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in my step-by-step computation. Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 Layer 3:1+3*13=40 Layer 4:1+3*40=121 Layer 5:1+3*121=364 Layer 6:1+3*364=1093 Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280 Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841 Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524 Then, 3*29524=88572.

Let me denote the entire expression as E: E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try expanding it layer by layer:\n\nFirst, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 3*(4) = 12, then 1 + 12 =13.\n\nNext layer: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 =40.\n\nNext: 3*40=120, 1+120=121.\n\nNext: 3*121=363, 1+363=364.\n\nNext: 3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093.\n\nNext: 3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280.\n\nNext: 3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841.\n\nNext: 3*9841=29523, 1+29523=29524.\n\nFinally, E = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my previous calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the layers, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand each term, it might form a geometric series.\n\nLet me try expanding E:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_i, where a_1 =1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, etc., up to a_9.\n\nThen, E = 3*a_9.\n\nBut perhaps expanding E, we can write:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I expand this, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it.\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each 1 is multiplied by 3^(number of layers above it). Wait, let's see:\n\nLet me think of each '1' in the expression as contributing to the total sum when multiplied by 3 raised to the number of times it's multiplied by 3. For example:\n\nThe innermost 1 is multiplied by 3 eight times (since there are eight layers above it) before being added to the total. Similarly, the next 1 is multiplied by 3 seven times, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which isn't multiplied by 3 at all.\n\nWait, let me check: The innermost 1 is in Layer 1, which is multiplied by 3 eight times as we go outwards. The next 1 in Layer 2 is multiplied by 3 seven times, etc., until the outermost 1 in Layer 9 is multiplied by 3 zero times, i.e., just 1.\n\nSo, the total sum would be the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, each multiplied by 1, plus the initial 3*1. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each '1' is being multiplied by 3 a certain number of times. So, the total sum would be 3*(sum from n=0 to 8 of 3^n). Because each 1 is being multiplied by 3^0, 3^1, up to 3^8, but then multiplied by 3 again.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me consider each '1' in the layers:\n\n- The innermost '1' is in Layer 1: it's multiplied by 3 eight times (since there are eight layers above it), so it's 1*3^8.\n\n- The next '1' in Layer 2: it's multiplied by 3 seven times, so 1*3^7.\n\n- This continues until the outermost '1' in Layer 9: it's multiplied by 3^0 =1.\n\nAdditionally, each '3' in the expression is part of the multiplication, but perhaps I'm conflating terms. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be seen as a sum of 3^k for k from 0 to 8, multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, let me try to express E as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nIf I expand each layer, the total would be:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nExpanding each layer:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nIf I keep expanding, each '1' is multiplied by 3 a certain number of times. Specifically, the first '1' (innermost) is multiplied by 3 eight times, the next '1' is multiplied by 3 seven times, and so on, until the outermost '1' is multiplied by 3^0.\n\nSo, the total would be:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nWhich, when fully expanded, would be:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) ).\n\nWait, perhaps the sum inside is a geometric series. Let me try to compute the sum S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...), which is similar to the layers we computed earlier.\n\nBut since we have a recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4, and a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, as we found earlier, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with our previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression E, it's 3 times a sum that's a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 and having 9 terms. Wait, but in our case, the number of terms might be different because each layer adds another term. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the expression, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps the total sum inside is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is a geometric series with each term being 3 times the previous.\n\nWait, if I consider that the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3^1*4, but that might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=8, multiplied by some factor.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me just stick with the step-by-step computation since that worked and gave me a clear answer.\n\nSo, to recap, I computed each layer from the innermost to the outermost, each time calculating 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing layer 9 as 29524, I multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe can break down the computation layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent.
