To double-check, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula and see if they match. For example, n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works.

Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading up to the ninth layer. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": ". So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but since each layer adds 1 and then multiplies by 3, it's a bit different. But using the recurrence relation helped me find a formula, which can be useful for larger numbers of layers without computing each step manually. However, in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing step by step was manageable. So, to recap: 1. Start from the innermost parentheses, compute each layer step by step. 2. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). 3. After computing up to the ninth layer, multiply the result by 3. 4. The result is 88572. I think that's solid.
