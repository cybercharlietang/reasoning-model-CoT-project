Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 1 + 3 times the next layer. It looks like there are nine layers here because I count nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check that again. Starting from the innermost, each time I go out, it's another 1 + 3(...). So, if I start counting from the innermost, the first one is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 1 + 3 times that, and so on. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of parentheses, each containing a 1 + 3(...). So, that would mean there are nine layers. Hmm, that seems a bit tedious, but maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of calculating each layer manually.\n\nWait, this structure reminds me of a geometric series or something similar because each term is multiplied by 3. Let me think about how that might work. If I denote each layer as a term, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to define each layer step by step. Let's denote the innermost expression as A1, then the next layer as A2, and so on up to A9, which would be the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, starting with A1: A1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, A2 = 1 + 3*A1\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*A2\n\nAnd this continues until A9 = 1 + 3*A8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A9.\n\nSo, if I can find a formula for An, I can compute A9 and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nAlternatively, since each An is defined in terms of An-1, maybe I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula for An.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms manually to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nCompute A1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nA2: 1 + 3*A1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nA3: 1 + 3*A2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nA4: 1 + 3*A3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nA5: 1 + 3*A4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nA6: 1 + 3*A5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nA7: 1 + 3*A6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nA8: 1 + 3*A7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nA9: 1 + 3*A8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*A9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so the final answer would be 88572. But let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the steps.\n\nLet me go through each step again to verify:\n\nA1 = 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nA2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nA3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nA4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nA5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nA6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nA7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nA8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nA9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3*A9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but maybe I can find a formula to avoid computing each step. Let me think about how to model this recursion.\n\nEach An is defined as An = 1 + 3*An-1, with A1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe recurrence is: An - 3*An-1 = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is An - 3*An-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is An^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution An^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is An = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition A1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is An = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: An = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for A9, n = 9:\n\nA9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, A9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*A9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 3*(previous) + 1. So, it's like a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 and an added constant each time.\n\nThe formula for such a recurrence is indeed An = (3^{n} - 1)/2, but in this case, since we start at A1 = 4, which is (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, so that aligns correctly.\n\nTherefore, for A9, which is the 9th term, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2, as we had before.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*A9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent as well. So, whether I compute each step manually, use the recurrence relation, or find the closed-form formula, I end up with the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, and the multiple methods lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By recognizing the pattern and using the formula for a geometric series, we can compute the result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each term is of the form An = 1 + 3*An-1, starting from A1 = 4.\n\n2. **Find the closed-form formula**: The solution to the recurrence relation is An = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n3. **Compute A9**: For n = 9, A9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*A9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " That usually makes sense with nested expressions because the innermost parts are evaluated first.\n\nSo, let me start by writing down the expression and seeing how many layers there are. The expression is: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the left, I see each 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nWait, actually, each time I see a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis, so maybe there are 9 layers? Let me check: starting from the innermost, which is the last 1+3, and each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears before the closing parentheses. Hmm, perhaps it's 9 layers? Let me try to parse it:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, it's 3 times that, plus 1, then 3 times that, plus 1, and so on, nine times? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next layer). So if I start from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), that's the ninth layer. Then each time I go outward, I add another layer.\n\nSo perhaps I can compute this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards, computing each layer step by step. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, when you have nested expressions, the innermost one is evaluated first, so maybe I should start with the innermost parentheses and work my way outward, computing each layer as I go. So the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost result)) + 1? Wait, no, let me see.\n\nWait, no, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So perhaps I should start with the innermost layer, which is just (1 + 3), then compute the next layer as 3*(1 + that result), then add 1? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the structure more carefully.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nSo each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) + 1? Wait, no, wait, let me parse it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of each layer as 3*(1 + next layer). Let me try to write this out step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Wait, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute from the inside out.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nThe innermost part is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving one layer out, we have 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)). Wait, but in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So let's see.\n\nWait, let me write down each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define L1 as the innermost expression: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, the next layer out is L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, but in the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, L3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so perhaps it's 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). Wait, so maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me check the structure again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So in that case, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nWait, that seems different from before. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, let me try again. Let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(4)).\n\nWait, so that would be 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nThen, the next layer out is 3*(1 + 3*(39)).\n\nWait, that would be 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nWait, that seems to be growing very quickly. Let me check if I'm doing this correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the structure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but that seems way too large, and I only have 9 layers, right? Wait, let me check: starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, carefully.\n\nLet me start over, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nSo, innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. That's Layer 1.\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3*Layer1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, the value is 188,329,404. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check if I have 9 layers correctly.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and there are 9 layers, right? Because each time I see a 3 followed by an opening parenthesis, and there are 9 such instances.\n\nWait, let me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...) in the expression:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nWait, actually, the expression ends with (1 + 3)), so maybe it's 8 layers? Because the innermost is (1 + 3), then each 3(1 + 3(...) adds another layer. So perhaps I have 8 layers, not 9. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression more carefully. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\n- Starting from the left, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...), so that's one layer.\n\nThen, inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...), so that's two layers.\n\nContinuing this way, each time I see a 3 followed by (1 + 3, that's a new layer.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nWait, so there are 8 layers of 3(1 + 3(...). Then, the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer? Or is it 8 layers in total?\n\nWait, perhaps the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the base case, and then each 3(1 + 3(...) adds a layer. So if I have 8 layers of 3(1 + 3(...), then the total number of layers is 8, with the innermost being (1 + 3).\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as 8 layers of 3*(1 + 3*(...)), each wrapping around the previous one. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nSo, let's compute 8 layers then.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489.\n\nWait, so after 8 layers, the value is 20,925,489. But the original expression seems to have 9 layers of 3(1 + 3(...). Hmm, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me check the expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the start, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nSo, starting from the left, each 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, and each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + 3*( occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n9. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n\nWait, actually, it's 9 layers of 3*(1 + 3*(...)), each nested within the previous one. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, if there are 9 layers, then the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, and then each layer up to 9 would be computed as 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)).\n\nSo, let me compute each layer from 1 to 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404.\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, the value is 188,329,404. That seems quite large, but perhaps that's correct. Let me check if I made any calculation errors in the layers.\n\nLet me verify a few of the layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication or addition.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28,704. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28,704) = 3*(1 + 86,112) = 3*86,113 = 258,339. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468. Let me compute that:\n\n62,776,468 * 3:\n\n62,776,468 * 3:\n\n60,000,000 * 3 = 180,000,000\n\n2,776,468 * 3 = 8,329,404\n\nSo, 180,000,000 + 8,329,404 = 188,329,404. Correct.\n\nSo, after computing all 9 layers, the final result is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, right? So, the first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, each time, we're adding another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so yes, 9 layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nWait, so that's a recursive formula: L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}).\n\nSo, starting from L_1 = 4,\n\nL_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15? Wait, no, wait, in my earlier calculation, I had L2 = 39. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the layers.\n\nWait, no, in my earlier calculation, I considered that each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)), which would be L_n = 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-1}).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining the recursion. Let me clarify.\n\nIf each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)), then the recursion is L_n = 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-1}).\n\nSo, with L_1 = 4,\n\nL_2 = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nL_3 = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354.\n\nAnd so on, as I did before. So, the recursion is L_n = 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-1}).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-1}).\n\nLet me write it as L_n = 3 + 9*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 9*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 9 = 0, so r = 9. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*9^n.\n\nNow, let's find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3 + 9*A.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 9*A = 3 => -8*A = 3 => A = -3/8.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*9^n - 3/8.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*9^1 - 3/8 => 4 = 9C - 3/8.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n9C = 4 + 3/8 = 32/8 + 3/8 = 35/8.\n\nSo, C = (35/8)/9 = 35/(8*9) = 35/72.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8.\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(35/72)*9^n = (35/72)*(9^n) = (35/72)*(9^n).\n\nAlternatively, 9^n = 9*9^{n-1}, so perhaps we can write it differently, but maybe it's better to compute it directly for n=9.\n\nWait, but let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1, L_1 = (35/72)*9^1 - 3/8 = (35/72)*9 - 3/8.\n\nCompute (35/72)*9 = (35*9)/72 = 315/72 = 35/8.\n\n35/8 - 3/8 = 32/8 = 4. Correct, matches L_1.\n\nFor n=2, L_2 = (35/72)*9^2 - 3/8 = (35/72)*81 - 3/8.\n\nCompute 35/72*81 = (35*81)/72 = (35*9)/8 = 315/8.\n\n315/8 - 3/8 = 312/8 = 39. Correct, matches L_2.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: L_3 = (35/72)*9^3 - 3/8.\n\n9^3 = 729.\n\n35/72*729 = (35*729)/72 = 35*(729/72) = 35*(101.25) = 35*101.25.\n\nWait, 729 \u00f7 72: 72*10=720, so 729-720=9, so 729/72 = 10 + 9/72 = 10 + 1/8 = 10.125.\n\nSo, 35*10.125 = 35*10 + 35*0.125 = 350 + 4.375 = 354.375.\n\nThen, subtract 3/8: 354.375 - 0.375 = 354. Correct, matches L_3.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 9^9.\n\n9^1 = 9\n\n9^2 = 81\n\n9^3 = 729\n\n9^4 = 6561\n\n9^5 = 59,049\n\n9^6 = 531,441\n\n9^7 = 4,782,969\n\n9^8 = 43,046,721\n\n9^9 = 387,420,489\n\nSo, 9^9 = 387,420,489.\n\nNow, compute (35/72)*387,420,489.\n\nFirst, let's compute 387,420,489 \u00f7 72.\n\n387,420,489 \u00f7 72:\n\nWell, 72 * 5,000,000 = 360,000,000.\n\nSubtract that from 387,420,489: 387,420,489 - 360,000,000 = 27,420,489.\n\nNow, 72 * 380,000 = 27,360,000.\n\nSubtract that: 27,420,489 - 27,360,000 = 60,489.\n\n72 * 839 = 60,489 (since 72*800=57,600; 72*39=2,808; 57,600 + 2,808 = 60,408. Wait, that's 60,408, which is less than 60,489 by 81. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, 72*839: Let's compute 800*72 = 57,600; 39*72 = 2,808; total 57,600 + 2,808 = 60,408.\n\nBut 60,408 is less than 60,489 by 81. So, 72*839 = 60,408.\n\nSo, 60,489 - 60,408 = 81.\n\nSo, 72*1 = 72, but 81 is 72 + 9, so it's 72*(839 + 1) + 9 = 72*840 + 9 = 60,480 + 9 = 60,489.\n\nWait, so 72*840 = 60,480, and 60,480 + 9 = 60,489, so 72*840 + 9 = 60,489.\n\nSo, 387,420,489 \u00f7 72 = 5,000,000 + 380,000 + 840 + (9/72).\n\nWait, but 9/72 = 1/8 = 0.125.\n\nSo, total is 5,380,840.125.\n\nNow, multiply by 35:\n\n35 * 5,380,840.125.\n\nCompute 35 * 5,380,840 = ?\n\nWell, 5,380,840 * 35 = 5,380,840 * 30 + 5,380,840 * 5.\n\n5,380,840 * 30 = 161,425,200.\n\n5,380,840 * 5 = 26,904,200.\n\nAdding together: 161,425,200 + 26,904,200 = 188,329,400.\n\nNow, the 0.125 part: 35 * 0.125 = 4.375.\n\nSo, total is 188,329,400 + 4.375 = 188,329,404.375.\n\nNow, subtract 3/8, which is 0.375.\n\nSo, 188,329,404.375 - 0.375 = 188,329,404.\n\nWhich matches the value I computed earlier by iterating each layer. So, that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 188,329,404.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I've got the correct number of layers. The original expression was:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and there are 9 such layers. So, yes, n=9 in the formula.\n\nThus, the value is 188,329,404.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it both by iterative computation and by solving the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{188329404}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\( 3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}) \\).\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 3 \\times 4)"

Since there are multiple layers, maybe I can compute each layer starting from the innermost one and work my way outwards. Let me count how many nested layers there are. Starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count them: 1+3, then another 1+3 around that, and so on until there are nine layers in total. So, I need to compute this from the inside out, nine times.\n\nLet me try to structure this. Let's denote each layer as a step, starting from the innermost one. Let me define each step as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3.\n\nThen, Step 2: Take that result, plug it into the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1).\n\nStep 3: Take the result from Step 2, plug it into the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2).\n\nAnd so on, until I reach Step 9, which will be the outermost layer. Then, after computing Step 9, I'll have the entire expression inside the final multiplication by 3. Then, I just multiply that result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nAlright, let's start with Step 1.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the innermost expression**\n\nSo, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's straightforward.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, Step 1 result: 4.\n\n**Step 2: Plug this result into the next layer**\n\nThe next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). Since Step 1 gave us 4, this becomes:\n\n1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute 3*4 first, which is 12, then add 1.\n\n1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, Step 2 result: 13.\n\n**Step 3: Plug Step 2 result into the next layer**\n\nNext layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 2). Step 2 was 13, so:\n\n1 + 3*13.\n\n3*13 is 39, then add 1.\n\n1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo, Step 3 result: 40.\n\n**Step 4: Plug Step 3 result into the next layer**\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 3). Step 3 was 40.\n\n1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, then add 1.\n\n1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 4 result: 121.\n\n**Step 5: Plug Step 4 result into the next layer**\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 4). Step 4 was 121.\n\n1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121: Let me compute that. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363.\n\nThen, 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 5 result: 364.\n\n**Step 6: Plug Step 5 result into the next layer**\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 5). Step 5 was 364.\n\n1 + 3*364.\n\nCompute 3*364. Let's break it down: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092.\n\nThen, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 6 result: 1093.\n\n**Step 7: Plug Step 6 result into the next layer**\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 6). Step 6 was 1093.\n\n1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute 3*1093. Let me do this step by step. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.\n\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 7 result: 3280.\n\n**Step 8: Plug Step 7 result into the next layer**\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 7). Step 7 was 3280.\n\n1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute 3*3280. Let's break it down: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840.\n\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 8 result: 9841.\n\n**Step 9: Plug Step 8 result into the next layer**\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 8). Step 8 was 9841.\n\n1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute 3*9841. Let me compute this carefully. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.\n\nThen, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nStep 9 result: 29524.\n\nSo, now, after computing all nine steps, the entire expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Now, the original problem is to compute 3 times this result.\n\nSo, the final computation is:\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my addition again.\n\nWait, 29524 is broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12.\n\nAdding them step by step:\n\nStart with 60000 (from 20000*3).\n\nAdd 27000: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\nAdd 1500: 87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\nAdd 60: 88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\nAdd 12: 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me verify using another method to be sure. Let's compute 29524 * 3 directly.\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that's 87572.\n\nWait, that's different from the previous result. Hmm, that means I must have made a mistake in my earlier addition.\n\nWait, let's check again:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nBut when I multiplied digit by digit, I got 87,572. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made an error in one of the steps.\n\nWait, let's compute 29524 * 3 using another method, perhaps by adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 + 29524 = ?\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\nLet me add 29,524 + 29,524.\n\n24 + 24 = 48\n\n20 + 20 = 40\n\n500 + 500 = 1000\n\n9000 + 9000 = 18,000\n\n20,000 + 20,000 = 40,000\n\nAdding these together: 48 + 40 = 88, 88 + 1000 = 1088, 1088 + 18,000 = 19,088, 19,088 + 40,000 = 59,088.\n\nSo, 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,088.\n\nNow, add another 29,524 to get 3 times:\n\n59,088 + 29,524.\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n59,088 + 20,000 = 79,088\n\n79,088 + 9,524 = ?\n\n79,088 + 9,000 = 88,088\n\n88,088 + 524 = 88,612.\n\nWait, that's 88,612, which is different from both previous results. Now I'm really confused. There must be an error in my calculation somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier. Let me try that again.\n\nCompute 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87,572. Hmm, but when I added 29,524 three times, I got 88,612, which doesn't match. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition method.\n\nWait, let me check 29,524 \u00d7 3 again using another approach. Let's compute 30,000 \u00d7 3 = 90,000. Then subtract 476 \u00d7 3 because 30,000 - 476 = 29,524.\n\nWait, 30,000 - 29,524 = 476.\n\nSo, 29,524 \u00d7 3 = (30,000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90,000 - (476 \u00d7 3).\n\nCompute 476 \u00d7 3: 400\u00d73=1200, 70\u00d73=210, 6\u00d73=18. So, 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428.\n\nSo, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from the digit-by-digit method, which gave me 87,572. Now I'm really confused. There must be a mistake in my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try that again carefully.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that's 87,572. But when I did the other method, I got 88,572. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made an error in one of the steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I broke down 29,524 \u00d7 3. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 29,524 \u00d7 3: Let's compute it as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3.\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, that's 88,572. But when I did the digit-by-digit method, I got 87,572, which is off by 1,000. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method.\n\nWait, let me check the digit-by-digit method again:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87,572. But that's incorrect because when I broke it down, I got 88,572. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, when multiplying by 3:\n\n4 (units) \u00d73 =12 \u2192 units digit 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 (tens) \u00d73 =6 +1=7 \u2192 tens digit 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 (hundreds) \u00d73=15 \u2192 hundreds digit 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 (thousands) \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands digit 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 (ten thousands) \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten thousands digit 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88,572. Oh! I see where I went wrong earlier. I think I miswrote the digits before. So, it's actually 88,572, not 87,572. I must have written the digits incorrectly when I first did it.\n\nSo, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I did the addition method earlier, I got 88,572, which matches this. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial digit-by-digit multiplication by misplacing a digit.\n\nSo, the correct final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this once more using another method. Let's compute 29,524 \u00d7 3 using a calculator approach.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 20,000 \u00d73 =60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d73=27,000\n\n500 \u00d73=1,500\n\n20 \u00d73=60\n\n4 \u00d73=12\n\nAdding these:\n\n60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 3 \u00d729,524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all the steps because earlier I thought I had 87,572, which was incorrect, but now I see that it's actually 88,572. So, I need to make sure that all the previous steps were correct.\n\nLet me go back through the steps:\n\nStep 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nStep 2:1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nStep 3:1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nStep 4:1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nStep 5:1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nStep 6:1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nStep 7:1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nStep 8:1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nStep 9:1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524=88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps are correct, and the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's it. It was a bit confusing when I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication earlier, but after verifying, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so let me count them. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nWait, let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" appears. Let's see, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Then, moving out one layer, it's 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n3. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n5. Then: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n7. Then: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n9. Then: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers I actually have. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so when I expand each layer, I should have 9 steps. Wait, let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication by 3: 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any layers. The original expression is 3 times a big parenthesis, which itself contains 1 plus 3 times another parenthesis, and so on, 8 more times. So that's 9 layers in total inside the 3 multiplication. So, yes, 9 steps from the innermost to the outermost. So, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me write each step more clearly:\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) *3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.

The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses, each with a 1 plus 3 times another expression. Let me start from the innermost one and work my way out. That seems logical because each expression depends on the one inside it. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That should be straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the next layer becomes 3 times (1 + 3), but wait, no, let me clarify. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps I should label each layer to keep track.\n\nLet me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. So, layer 1 is (1 + 3). Layer 2 is 3*(layer1) + 1? Wait, no, looking back at the original expression, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, layer 1 is (1 + 3), layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3), layer 3 is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as each layer being 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me parse the structure carefully.\n\nLooking at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... )). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, ..., E9, where E1 is the innermost and E9 is the outermost.\n\nSo, E1 = 1 + 3\n\nE2 = 1 + 3*E1\n\nE3 = 1 + 3*E2\n\nE4 = 1 + 3*E3\n\nE5 = 1 + 3*E4\n\nE6 = 1 + 3*E5\n\nE7 = 1 + 3*E6\n\nE8 = 1 + 3*E7\n\nE9 = 1 + 3*E8\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each E is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, perhaps I should index them differently. Let me try again.\n\nLet me start from the innermost parentheses and compute each layer outward.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 3*(4) + 1? Wait, no. Let me look at the original expression. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3*(Layer9). Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the nested layers. So, after computing Layer9 as 29524, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first parenthesis after 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3\n\nWait, so there are nine layers here, each with a 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer: (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around it. So, my earlier calculation of 9 layers seems correct, leading to Layer9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations step by step again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nStarting with Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be error-prone.\n\nLooking at each layer, each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for Layer n.\n\nThe recurrence is: Layer(n) = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nLayer(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve it.\n\nGiven Layer(n) = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), Layer(1) = 4.\n\nAssume Layer(n) = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, set equal to left side:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition Layer(1) = 4:\n\nLayer(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Layer(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nLayer(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\nn=2: Layer(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so Layer9 = (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so Layer9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each nested expression as \\( E_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_9 \\), where \\( E_1 \\) is the innermost and \\( E_9 \\) is the outermost.

    "text": " That usually works with nested expressions. So, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the last (1+3), which is the seventh one from the left. Let me write down each step as I go, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Let's number the parentheses from the inside out to keep track. So, starting with the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, that part is straightforward. So, replacing that, the expression becomes:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+4)))))))))$\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct that. Actually, each time I replace an innermost expression, I have to make sure I'm replacing the correct one. Let me try again. Let's list each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine layers of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, counting the layers: Let's see, the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, that's (1 + 3), then each layer wraps another 1 + 3*(...). So, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the entire expression is multiplied by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, and then the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by starting from the innermost and working outwards, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that. So, starting with the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, that's Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nSo, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute 3*13: 39.

So, 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3280: Let's compute that. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nLayer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000 \u2192 Wait, no, that's incorrect.

Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer's result).\n3. Compute each layer step by step, from 1 up to 9 layers.\n4. Finally, multiply the 9th layer's result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nYes, that seems correct.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let me start by writing down the expression to get a better sense of its structure. The outermost part is 3 times (1 + something). That something is 3 times another (1 + something else), and this pattern continues until the innermost part, which is just 1 + 3. So, I can think of this as a series of nested expressions, each starting with 1 + 3 times the next one. \n\nMaybe it would help to label each part to keep track. Let's define each nested expression as a variable. Let me start from the innermost one. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- Let\u2019s call the innermost expression A. So, A = 1 + 3.\n- Then, moving one step out, we have B = 1 + 3A.\n- Next, C = 1 + 3B.\n- And so on, until we get to the outermost expression, which would be 3 times the last one.\n\nWait, let me check how many layers there are. The expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 sets of parentheses, each adding another layer. So, that means we have 9 layers of nesting. Hmm, maybe I should count them to be sure.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Wait, actually, each 1+3 is followed by another parenthesis, except the last one. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as there are 9 sets of 1+3(...). Let me confirm:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n...\n9. 1 + 3*(...all the way to the innermost...)\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers. That means I need to compute each layer starting from the innermost one and work my way outwards. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start with the innermost expression, which is A = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, A = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext, moving one step out, we have B = 1 + 3*A. Since A is 4, B = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, moving out another layer, C = 1 + 3*B. B is 13, so C = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext, D = 1 + 3*C. C is 40, so D = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nMoving out, E = 1 + 3*D. D is 121, so E = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext, F = 1 + 3*E. E is 364, so F = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nThen, G = 1 + 3*F. F is 1093, so G = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext, H = 1 + 3*G. G is 3280, so H = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nThen, I = 1 + 3*H. H is 9841, so I = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3*(I). I is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. I labeled them A to I, which is 9 letters, so that should correspond to the 9 layers. So, starting from A as the innermost, each subsequent letter represents the next outer layer. So, after computing I, which is the 9th layer, the entire expression is 3*I.\n\nSo, computing 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Maybe breaking it down like that will help.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because when I did it step by step:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, so 2 with a carryover of 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nNext: 5 * 3 = 15, so 5 with a carryover of 1.\n\nNext: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8 with a carryover of 2.\n\nNext: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this multiplication another way. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048.\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when you're doing a lot of steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nA = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nB = 1 + 3*A = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.\n\nC = 1 + 3*B = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct.\n\nD = 1 + 3*C = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct.\n\nE = 1 + 3*D = 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct.\n\nF = 1 + 3*E = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct.\n\nG = 1 + 3*F = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct.\n\nH = 1 + 3*G = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct.\n\nI = 1 + 3*H = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*I = 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each step manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a known mathematical pattern.\n\nLooking at the expressions, each layer is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\nx_{n} = 1 + 3*x_{n-1}\n\nwith the innermost term x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe recurrence is x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is x_n - 3x_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is x_h = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say x_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is x_n = x_h + x_p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, x_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nx_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, x_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier by computing each step manually. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis method using the recurrence relation is much faster and less error-prone, especially if the number of layers increases. It's always good to recognize patterns and apply mathematical formulas when possible to simplify the computation.\n\nWait, let me just make sure that I applied the formula correctly. So, if n is the number of layers, starting from n=1 as the innermost, then for 9 layers, n=9. So, x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Yes, that's correct because each layer adds one more exponent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of times we apply the 3 multiplier. Since each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric series.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is that each layer is building up a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, the innermost is 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nWait, so 13 is 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, which is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nWait, so 40 is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nSimilarly, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81.\n\nSo, each layer adds another term in the geometric series where each term is 3^n, starting from n=0.\n\nSo, for x_n, the value is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I derived earlier using the recurrence relation. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, for 9 layers, the sum is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that this is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. It's always reassuring when different approaches confirm the same answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe define each nested expression as follows:\n- Let \\(A = 1 + 3\\)\n- Then, \\(B = 1 + 3A\\)\n- Next, \\(C = 1 + 3B\\)\n- And so on, until we reach the outermost expression.\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n1. \\(A = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(B = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. \\(C = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. \\(D = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. \\(E = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. \\(F = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(G = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(H = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(I = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\(3 \\times I\\):\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe I should start by simplifying the innermost part and then work my way outwards. Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, okay, so starting from the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, I'm replacing the innermost parentheses with its value, then moving outward. So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, the next layer would be (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. \n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*(13)) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*(40)) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*(121)) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*(364)) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*(1093)) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*(3280)) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*(9841)) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me go through each step carefully to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check each step again because it's easy to make a multiplication error.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next, 1 + 3*13: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Then, 1 + 3*40: 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next, 1 + 3*121: 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Then, 1 + 3*364: 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next, 1 + 3*1093: 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Then, 1 + 3*3280: 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next, 1 + 3*9841: 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, 3*29524: Let's compute that. 3*29524. \n\nWait, 3*29524: Let me compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\n3*29524: \n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly. The original expression has 9 layers of (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) is a layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times (1 + 3(...) appears:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. So, each time I open a new (1 + 3(...)), that's a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"3(\" is followed by a new layer. So, the first layer is 3(1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 3(1 + 3 occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first, it's 3(1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent one adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3(1 + 3(...), there are 8 more opening parentheses, making a total of 9 layers. So, I think I correctly expanded 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, but when I did the computation, I only went through 9 steps, each time computing a new layer. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be expressed as a geometric series or something. Let me think about that.\n\nEach time, the expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so it's a recursive expression. Let me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9, since there are 9 layers.\n\nWait, actually, the innermost layer is a_1, then a_2, up to a_9, which is the outermost expression before multiplying by the initial 3.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I started from the innermost and worked outwards, computing each layer step by step, which is the same as computing a_1, a_2, ..., a_9, and then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I computed up to a_9, then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nEach a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWe can write this as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, which also matches.\n\nGood, so the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I correctly identified n as 9. Since the innermost layer is a_1, and each subsequent layer adds one more, so with 9 layers, a_9 is the outermost before multiplying by 3. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms, but since each step is 1 + 3*previous, the formula we derived seems appropriate.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression can be broken down into a recursive formula where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term, leading to a geometric progression which can be solved with the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Applying this for n=9 gives us 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach led me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a recursive formula. Using a geometric series approach, the nth term is found to be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, this gives 29524, and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate the order in which operations should be performed. So, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so now, moving one step out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, substituting the innermost part, it becomes 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3*(result from the previous step). So substituting 13 in, we get:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so that's 40. Let me keep going. The next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, 121? That seems a bit large, but okay, moving on. The next layer is 1 + 3*(121). Let me calculate that:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nHmm, 364. That's getting bigger each time. Let me see if I can spot a pattern here. So far, the results from each layer are 4, 13, 40, 121, 364... Wait, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me check that.\n\nFrom 4 to 13: 4*3 + 1 = 13. Yep, that works.\n\nFrom 13 to 40: 13*3 + 1 = 40. Correct.\n\nFrom 40 to 121: 40*3 + 1 = 121. Right.\n\nFrom 121 to 364: 121*3 + 1 = 364. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nSo, each time, we take the previous result, multiply by 3, add 1, and that gives the next layer's result. So, since the expression is nested nine times, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is 4, and then each subsequent layer is 3 times the previous plus 1.\n\nWait, let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's the first layer, then each subsequent 1+3(...) is another layer. Let me count them: 1+3, then 1+3(...), then another, etc. Let's see, starting from the innermost, each time we add a layer outward. Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of 3s.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, I can note that each layer corresponds to a multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, starting from 4. So, if I have n layers, each time applying the operation x = 3x + 1, starting from x = 4.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me see. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...)))\n4. (1+3(...)))\n5. (1+3(...)))\n6. (1+3(...)))\n7. (1+3(...)))\n8. (1+3(...)))\n9. (1+3(...)))\n\nWait, so each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer, so starting from the innermost, each layer is another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me see: the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is the first, and each time we go out another layer, adding another 1+3. Wait, let me check: the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each time we have a 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...)))\n4. (1+3(...)))\n5. (1+3(...)))\n6. (1+3(...)))\n7. (1+3(...)))\n8. (1+3(...)))\n9. (1+3(...)))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, and so on, up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I calculated earlier, I only went up to 364, which was the fifth layer. So, maybe I need to compute more layers. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me make a table:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so at Layer 9, the value is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3 multiplied by this Layer 9 result. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. So adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; +1,500 = 88,500; +72 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the total value is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to make an error when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nEach layer is defined by x_{n} = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for x_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is x_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. At n=1, x_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's consider the homogeneous solution and particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is x_n - 3x_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is x_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume it's a constant, say B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is x_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition x_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: x_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: x_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: x_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: x_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: x_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, x_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, x_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*x_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...)))\n4. (1+3(...)))\n5. (1+3(...)))\n6. (1+3(...)))\n7. (1+3(...)))\n8. (1+3(...)))\n9. (1+3(...)))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, meaning n=9. So, x_9=29524, then 3*29524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the outermost expression is 3*(x_9), so the total is 3*x_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, because 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177,147.\n\nSo, (177,147 -3)/2=177,144/2=88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by step-by-step calculation and by finding a closed-form formula, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. There are 9 layers in total. Using the formula for such a recurrence relation, we find the result of the innermost 9 layers, then multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " So, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so that part is simple enough. Now, moving one step out, the next layer would be 1 + 3 times that result. So, let's compute that. Next layer: 1 + 3*(innermost result) = 1 + 3*4. Hmm, 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Alright, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Okay, so now we have 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. So, that's 121. Continuing this pattern, the next layer would be 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Alright, so now we have 364. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, that layer simplifies to 1093. Next layer out: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, now we have 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, and 3*80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, that's 9841. Next layer out: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, now we have 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*29524. Let's calculate that. 3*29524: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. So, that layer simplifies to 88573. Now, remember that the entire original expression is 3 times this result. So, the entire expression is 3*(88573). Let me compute that: 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 265719. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, 1+3*13=40, 1+3*40=121, 1+3*121=364, 1+3*364=1093, 1+3*1093=3280, 1+3*3280=9841, 1+3*9841=29524, 1+3*29524=88573. Then, 3*88573=265719. Hmm, seems correct. I don't see any errors in the steps I took. Each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1, working my way outward. So, I think the final answer is 265719.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we simplify the expression as follows:\n\n1. Innermost: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n10. Next: \\(1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 88573\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 88573 = 265719\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{265719}"

    "text": " That usually works well with nested expressions. So, maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, counting the number of parentheses, it seems like there are nine sets of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3), and then each layer adds another 3 times a term. Let me try to break it down layer by layer. Let's start with the innermost expression: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, that simplifies the innermost parentheses to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, perhaps I should define each layer as a step, starting from the innermost one. Let me try to outline each step: Let me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 Now, the entire original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer9. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(1 + Layer9). Wait, no, that might not be correct because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, actually, the innermost Layer1 is (1 + 3), then Layer2 is 3*(1 + Layer1), and so on up to Layer9, which would be 3*(1 + Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). Wait, no, that can't be because if I have nine layers, then the outermost is Layer9. Let me check the structure again. The original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is Layer2. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, Layer3. Continuing this way, each Layer n is 3*(1 + Layer(n-1)). So, if I have nine layers, then Layer9 is 3*(1 + Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). Wait, that would make the outermost expression Layer9, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3), then each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count them: Starting after the first 3, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of layers: From the innermost to the outermost, how many times do we have \"1 + 3(\"? Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: 3*(1 + ...)\n3. Next: 3*(1 + ...)\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have a 3 multiplying a (1 + ...). Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, each time, we have a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, each step adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...): Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. That's Layer1.\n- Then, moving out, we have 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. That's Layer2.\n- Then, 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Layer3.\n- Then, 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. Layer4.\n- Then, 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. Layer5.\n- Then, 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. Layer6.\n- Then, 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. Layer7.\n- Then, 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. Layer8.\n- Then, 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. Layer9.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). Wait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*(1 + Layer9). So, let me compute that. So, after Layer9, which is 36084, we have 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085. Let me compute that: 36085 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 36000 * 3 = 108000, and 85 * 3 = 255. So, 108000 + 255 = 108255. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 108255.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))\n2. The first innermost is (1 + 3)\n3. Then each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer.\n\nSo, from the innermost (1 + 3) up to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer1\n- Then 3*(1 + Layer1) \u2192 Layer2\n- Then 3*(1 + Layer2) \u2192 Layer3\n- And so on until Layer9.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer9, I ended up with 36084, and then the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255. But let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer1\n- Then, moving out, each \"1 + 3(\" is another layer. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, how many times does \"1 + 3(\" appear?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3)\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1)\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2)\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3)\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4)\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5)\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6)\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7)\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8)\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). So, that would make the total expression 3*(1 + Layer9). So, with Layer9 being 36084, then 1 + 36084 is 36085, and 3*36085 is 108255.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations for each layer. Let me go through each layer step by step again:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085.\n\nCalculating 36085 * 3:\n\n36000 * 3 = 108000\n\n85 * 3 = 255\n\nAdding them together: 108000 + 255 = 108255.\n\nSo, the final result is 108255.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWith a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me see if I can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's write down the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and we can solve it by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation.\n\nSince the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 3\n\n-2K = 3\n\nK = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nGiven a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C\n\nWhich is 5.5 = 3C\n\nSo, C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n})/(2*3) )= (11*3^{n-1})/2\n\nWait, alternatively, let me compute a_n:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can factor out 1/6:\n\na_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, the problem requires computing up to n=9, which is Layer9, which is a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\nSo, 3^9 = 19683\n\nThus, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nSo, 196830 + 19683 = 216513\n\nThen, subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504\n\nNow, divide by 6: 216504 / 6\n\nDivide step by step:\n\n6*36084 = 216504\n\nBecause 6*36000=216000, and 6*84=504, so 216000 + 504 = 216504.\n\nThus, a_9 = 36084, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where each a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 3)/2, but let me check.\n\nWait, for n=1, a_1=4.\n\n(3^{2} - 3)/2 = (9 - 3)/2 = 6/2 = 3. Not 4. So that formula doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but from our earlier formula, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, let's see, the expression is 3*(1 + a_9). So, 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a formula for the entire expression, which is 3*(1 + a_9).\n\nGiven that a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6, then 1 + a_9 = 1 + (11*3^9 - 9)/6 = (6 + 11*3^9 - 9)/6 = (11*3^9 - 3)/6.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(11*3^9 - 3)/6 = (33*3^9 - 9)/6.\n\nSimplify:\n\n33*3^9 = 11*3*3^9 = 11*3^{10}\n\nSo, 33*3^9 = 11*3^{10}\n\nThus, 3*(1 + a_9) = (11*3^{10} - 9)/6.\n\nCompute that:\n\n3^{10} = 59049\n\nSo, 11*59049 = Let's compute that:\n\n59049 * 10 = 590490\n\n59049 * 1 = 59049\n\nTotal: 590490 + 59049 = 649,539\n\nNow, 649,539 - 9 = 649,530\n\nDivide by 6: 649530 / 6 = 108,255.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before: 108,255.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 108,255.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the exponents.\n\n3^9 is 19,683, correct.\n\n11*19,683 = Let's compute 10*19,683 = 196,830, plus 1*19,683 = 19,683, totaling 216,513.\n\nSubtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504.\n\nDivide by 6: 216,504 / 6 = 36,084, which is correct.\n\nThen, 1 + 36,084 = 36,085.\n\n3*36,085: 36,085 * 3.\n\nCompute 36,000 * 3 = 108,000.\n\n85 * 3 = 255.\n\nAdd them: 108,000 + 255 = 108,255.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the entire expression:\n\n(11*3^{10} - 9)/6.\n\n3^{10} is 59,049.\n\n11*59,049 = 649,539.\n\n649,539 - 9 = 649,530.\n\n649,530 / 6 = 108,255.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is 108,255.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " That usually works for these kinds of problems because each layer depends on the one inside it.\n\nAlright, so let me write down the expression again to visualize it better. It's:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each containing 1 plus 3 times another expression. So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, and working my way outwards. That makes sense because each layer is dependent on the result of the inner one.\n\nLet me start by evaluating the innermost parentheses first. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That should be straightforward.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next parentheses would be 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that down:\n\n1 + 3*(result from innermost parentheses) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nWait, but actually, in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, let me try to represent each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s define Layer 1 as the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4.\n\nLayer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, actually, in the original problem, the entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the inner expression. So maybe I should consider that as Layer 0, and then the inner expressions as Layers 1 through 9? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the left, the first part is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... So, each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(... So, the number of layers is 9, as each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and moving outwards to the first layer, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and working our way out. So, the innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on up to Layer 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(...), so maybe Layer 1 is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nWell, 3*29,000 is 87,000. 3*524 is 1,572. So adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*29524 as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88,572.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each layer computation step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, because it's easy to make an arithmetic error when multiplying by 3 repeatedly.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*29524 again using another method to be absolutely sure. Let's break down 29524:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*20=60\n\n3*4=12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's 88,572. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of expression to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that.\n\nThis expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model it.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n is the number of layers. So, Layer 1: L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nLayer 2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1.\n\nLayer 3: L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2.\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9: L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8.\n\nSo, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n = 1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my initial step-by-step computation, I can cross-verify using the formula.\n\nSince L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to compute this without using the formula, I could have noticed that each layer is a multiple of 3 plus 1, which might relate to powers of 3, but perhaps the formula approach is more efficient.\n\nIn any case, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards, evaluating each layer and substituting the result into the next layer. \n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, the entire expression is \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nSo, the expression is built like this: starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), and then each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the next parentheses. Let me try to write this out step by step, starting from the innermost part and moving outward. \n\nLet me define each layer to make it clearer. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)  \n... and so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of layers to make sure. Starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each time we go outward, we add another layer. So, the innermost is Layer 1: (1+3). Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, which is the outermost one. So, we need to compute up to Layer 9 and then multiply by 3 at the end. \n\nWait, actually, looking at the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire expression inside the first parentheses. So, maybe I should consider that as Layer 1, but perhaps it's better to just compute each innermost layer step by step. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, Layer 1 is 4. \n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 is 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait, but the original problem is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the first parentheses, which we just computed as Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. \n\n3*29524: Let me break it down. 29524 * 3. \n\n29,524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6 +1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27 +1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6 +2 is 8. So, 29,524 * 3 is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29,524  \n\u00d7        3  \n----------\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer was computed step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, and then moving outward, each time substituting the value of the inner layer into the outer one. Finally, after computing the outermost parentheses, we multiplied the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers, let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth term.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the nth layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4. Then, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving such recursions.\n\nThe general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), but in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so c = 3 and d = 1.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is when n=1, so perhaps the formula starts at n=1. Let me check.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which is a_n = C*3^{n}.\n\nThen, the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the equation:\n\nK = 3*K + 1  \nK - 3K = 1  \n-2K = 1  \nK = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2  \n4 = 3C - 1/2  \n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2  \nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern. Using a formula derived from solving the recurrence relation, we compute the value of the outermost parentheses and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the recursive pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost layer (1+3)=4.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let me see: the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then 3*4=12, then (1 + 12)=13, then 3*13=39, then (1 + 39)=40, then 3*40=120, then (1 + 120)=121, then 3*121=363, then (1 + 363)=364, then 3*364=1092, then (1 + 1092)=1093, then 3*1093=3279, then (1 + 3279)=3280, then 3*3280=9840, then (1 + 9840)=9841, then 3*9841=29523. Hmm, that seems like 16 steps, but let me check the original expression again to make sure I didn't miss any levels.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent term adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of 3s in the expression. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new level. So starting from the first 3, then inside that is another 3, and so on. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3 is at the very beginning.\n2. Then inside that, another 3.\n3. Then another 3.\n4. And so on, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nWait, actually, each time I see a \"3(\", that's a new level. Let me count the number of \"3(\" in the expression:\n\nLooking at the expression: \n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3, then each time I see a 3 followed by a (, that's a new level. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 times \"3(\", which would mean that there are 9 levels of multiplication by 3. So starting from the innermost, which is level 9, then working outwards to level 1. Hmm, but when I computed earlier, I ended up with 16 steps, which seems too many. Maybe I miscounted the levels.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as each \"3(\" corresponds to a new level. So the innermost is (1+3), which is level 1. Then each time we go out, we add another level. Let me try again, starting from the innermost and moving outwards, keeping track of each level.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 3 * (Level 1 result) = 3 * 4 = 12\n\nLevel 3: (1 + Level 2 result) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 4: 3 * Level 3 result = 3 * 13 = 39\n\nLevel 5: (1 + Level 4 result) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 6: 3 * Level 5 result = 3 * 40 = 120\n\nLevel 7: (1 + Level 6 result) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 8: 3 * Level 7 result = 3 * 121 = 363\n\nLevel 9: (1 + Level 8 result) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 10: 3 * Level 9 result = 3 * 364 = 1092\n\nLevel 11: (1 + Level 10 result) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 12: 3 * Level 11 result = 3 * 1093 = 3279\n\nLevel 13: (1 + Level 12 result) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 14: 3 * Level 13 result = 3 * 3280 = 9840\n\nLevel 15: (1 + Level 14 result) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 16: 3 * Level 15 result = 3 * 9841 = 29523\n\nWait, so that's 16 levels, but the original expression only has 9 \"3(\"s. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3, each subsequent \"3(\" is one level deeper. Let me count the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then another 3(\n3. And so on, until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, how many \"3(\" are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then inside that, another 3, and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time there's a \"3(\", that's a new level. So from the first 3, we have 9 more \"3(\" before reaching the innermost (1+3). So that would make it 10 levels in total? Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of nested expressions. Each time you have a 3 followed by a (, that's a new level. Let me count them:\n\n1. The first 3 is level 1.\n2. Then inside that, another 3(, so level 2.\n3. Then another 3(, level 3.\n4. Continuing this way, until the innermost (1+3), which would be level 9.\n\nSo, 9 levels in total. Therefore, when I computed up to level 16, I must have gone too far. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is level 9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen level 8: 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nLevel 7: (1 + 12) = 13.\n\nLevel 6: 3 * 13 = 39.\n\nLevel 5: (1 + 39) = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 3 * 40 = 120.\n\nLevel 3: (1 + 120) = 121.\n\nLevel 2: 3 * 121 = 363.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 363) = 364.\n\nWait, but the original expression starts with 3(, so after computing level 1, which is (1 + 363) = 364, then we have to multiply by 3 again, right? Because the entire expression is 3 times that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Let me represent each level as a step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as S\u2081 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving outwards, S\u2082 = 1 + 3*S\u2081.\n\nThen S\u2083 = 1 + 3*S\u2082.\n\nAnd so on, until S\u2089 = 1 + 3*S\u2088.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*S\u2089.\n\nWait, that might make more sense. So, if I define S\u2081 as the innermost, then each subsequent S is built upon the previous one.\n\nSo, S\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nS\u2082 = 1 + 3*S\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nS\u2083 = 1 + 3*S\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nS\u2084 = 1 + 3*S\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nS\u2085 = 1 + 3*S\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nS\u2086 = 1 + 3*S\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nS\u2087 = 1 + 3*S\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nS\u2088 = 1 + 3*S\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nS\u2089 = 1 + 3*S\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*S\u2089, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, if S\u2089 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If S\u2081 is the innermost, then S\u2082 is built upon S\u2081, and so on, up to S\u2089. Then the entire expression is 3*S\u2089.\n\nSo, let's compute S\u2081 through S\u2089:\n\nS\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nS\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nS\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nS\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nS\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nS\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nS\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nS\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nS\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S\u2089 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing step by step, I ended up with 29523 at step 16, but that seems inconsistent with this approach where S\u2089 is 29524, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step-by-step approach because I miscounted the number of levels. Let me check this again.\n\nIn the S\u2081 to S\u2089 approach, S\u2081 is the innermost, and S\u2089 is the result before the final multiplication by 3. So, if S\u2089 is 29524, then 3*S\u2089 is 88572.\n\nBut in my earlier step-by-step approach, I ended up with 29523, which is one less than 29524. That suggests that I might have missed a step or miscalculated somewhere.\n\nLet me try recalculating S\u2089:\n\nStarting from S\u2081:\n\nS\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nS\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nS\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nS\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nS\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nS\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nS\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nS\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nS\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, S\u2089 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing step by step, I ended up with 29523 as the result before the final multiplication, which would make the final answer 3*29523=88569, but that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the levels in the earlier approach. Let me try to map both approaches.\n\nIn the S\u2081 to S\u2089 approach, each S is built from the previous, with S\u2081 being the innermost. So, S\u2081 is (1+3), then S\u2082 is 1+3*S\u2081, etc., up to S\u2089. Then the entire expression is 3*S\u2089.\n\nIn the earlier step-by-step approach, I started from the innermost (1+3)=4, then multiplied by 3 to get 12, then added 1 to get 13, multiplied by 3 to get 39, added 1 to get 40, and so on, until I got to 29523, which I then multiplied by 3 to get 88569. But that's conflicting with the S\u2081 to S\u2089 approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising from whether the final multiplication by 3 is included in S\u2089 or not. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the S\u2081 to S\u2089 approach, S\u2089 is the result of the innermost expression up to the ninth level, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S\u2089, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nIn the earlier step-by-step approach, I was working from the innermost outwards, but perhaps I included the final multiplication by 3 as part of the levels, leading to an extra step. Let me recount the levels properly.\n\nLet me try to list each step clearly, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next level: 3 * 4 = 12.\n\n3. Next level: (1 + 12) = 13.\n\n4. Next level: 3 * 13 = 39.\n\n5. Next level: (1 + 39) = 40.\n\n6. Next level: 3 * 40 = 120.\n\n7. Next level: (1 + 120) = 121.\n\n8. Next level: 3 * 121 = 363.\n\n9. Next level: (1 + 363) = 364.\n\n10. Next level: 3 * 364 = 1092.\n\n11. Next level: (1 + 1092) = 1093.\n\n12. Next level: 3 * 1093 = 3279.\n\n13. Next level: (1 + 3279) = 3280.\n\n14. Next level: 3 * 3280 = 9840.\n\n15. Next level: (1 + 9840) = 9841.\n\n16. Next level: 3 * 9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, so after 16 steps, I end up with 29523. But according to the S\u2081 to S\u2089 approach, S\u2089 is 29524, leading to 88572. There's a discrepancy here because in the S\u2081 approach, S\u2089 is 29524, whereas in the step-by-step approach, I end up with 29523 after 16 steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that in the S\u2081 approach, S\u2089 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*S\u2089, which is 88572. But in the step-by-step approach, I computed up to 29523, which is S\u2089 without the final multiplication, but then I multiplied by 3 again, leading to 88569, which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the step-by-step approach. Let me check the calculations again:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. 3 * 4 = 12.\n\n3. (1 + 12) = 13.\n\n4. 3 * 13 = 39.\n\n5. (1 + 39) = 40.\n\n6. 3 * 40 = 120.\n\n7. (1 + 120) = 121.\n\n8. 3 * 121 = 363.\n\n9. (1 + 363) = 364.\n\n10. 3 * 364 = 1092.\n\n11. (1 + 1092) = 1093.\n\n12. 3 * 1093 = 3279.\n\n13. (1 + 3279) = 3280.\n\n14. 3 * 3280 = 9840.\n\n15. (1 + 9840) = 9841.\n\n16. 3 * 9841 = 29523.\n\nSo, after 16 steps, I reach 29523. Then, if I multiply by 3 again, I get 88569. But according to the S\u2081 approach, the entire expression is 3*S\u2089, where S\u2089 is 29524, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps the S\u2081 approach is correct, and I made a miscalculation in the step-by-step approach. Let me check S\u2089 again:\n\nS\u2081 = 4.\n\nS\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nS\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nS\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nS\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nS\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nS\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nS\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nS\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, S\u2089 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut in the step-by-step approach, I ended up with 29523 after 16 steps, which suggests that I might have miscounted the number of levels. Let me check the original expression again to see how many levels there are.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, there are 9 \"3(\" after the initial 3, meaning there are 9 levels of nesting. Therefore, the innermost expression is level 9, which is (1 + 3). Then, each level up adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1.\n\nSo, in the S\u2081 approach, S\u2081 is level 1 (innermost), and S\u2089 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*S\u2089, where S\u2089 is 29524, leading to 88572.\n\nIn the step-by-step approach, I computed up to 29523, which would be S\u2089 without the final multiplication, but then I multiplied by 3 again, which would be incorrect because S\u2089 already includes all the innermost operations up to that point. Therefore, the correct final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another method. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can often be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nIn this case, each level is of the form S\u2099 = 1 + 3*S\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general form is S\u2099 = 1 + 3*S\u2099\u208b\u2081, with S\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is S\u2099 - 3*S\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is S\u2099^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form S\u2099^p = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\n-2A = 1\n\nA = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is S\u2099 = S\u2099^h + S\u2099^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition S\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is S\u2099 = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nS\u2099 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since S\u2089 is the outermost before the final multiplication, let's compute S\u2089 using this formula:\n\nS\u2089 = (3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049.\n\nSo, S\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*S\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think earlier, in the step-by-step approach, I mistakenly continued one step beyond the required levels, leading to an incorrect result. By using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the correct result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each level is defined as S\u2099 = 1 + 3*S\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from S\u2081 = 4. Using the recurrence relation, we find that S\u2089 = 29524. The entire expression is 3*S\u2089, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That sounds like a plan. So, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me write that down: Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, so that simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. Alright, so now I can replace the innermost two layers with 13. Let me rewrite the original expression with that substitution. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, if I replace the innermost (1 + 3(1 + 3)) with 13, the next layer becomes 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. Now, I can replace that part in the expression. So now, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. So, that layer is 121. Hmm, I'm starting to see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. Let me check that. So, starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 1 + 3*40 = 121. Let me confirm that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Yep, that's correct. So, each time, the value is 1 + 3*(previous value). So, let me try to see how many layers there are. Let's count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count them: 1. 3(1+3(...)) 2. 3(1+3(...)) 3. 3(1+3(...)) 4. 3(1+3(...)) 5. 3(1+3(...)) 6. 3(1+3(...)) 7. 3(1+3(...)) 8. 3(1+3(...)) 9. 3(1+3(...)) So, there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...) starting from the innermost. Wait, but when I started, I thought the innermost was (1+3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost. Let me recount. Starting from the innermost (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each time we go outward, we add another layer. So, the expression is built as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, I need to compute this 9-layer expression. Alternatively, maybe it's 8 layers because the outermost is 3*(...). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Let me think of it as a nested function. The innermost is (1 + 3), then each step out is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from 4. Wait, let me try to outline this step by step. Let me define each step as follows:\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = (1 + 3) = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(a_9). Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, after computing a_9, which is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. So, if a_1 is the innermost, then a_2 is the next, up to a_9, which would be the expression inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I computed up to a_9 as 29524, but that was when a_9 was defined as 1 + 3*a_8. So, in that case, the total expression would be 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check that again because maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try to outline each step with the correct number of layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the outermost 3*(...) is a separate layer beyond a_9. Let me think about how many layers there are in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3(1+3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3), which is layer 1.\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n2. 3*(1 + layer1)\n\n3. 3*(1 + layer2)\n\n4. 3*(1 + layer3)\n\n5. 3*(1 + layer4)\n\n6. 3*(1 + layer5)\n\n7. 3*(1 + layer6)\n\n8. 3*(1 + layer7)\n\n9. 3*(1 + layer8)\n\nAnd then the outermost is 3*(1 + layer9).\n\nWait, so that would make the total number of layers 9, with the outermost being 3*(1 + layer9). So, in that case, a_9 would be the innermost, and the outermost is 3*(1 + a_9). So, perhaps my earlier approach was incorrect because I considered a_9 as the expression inside the outermost 3*(...), but actually, the outermost is 3*(1 + a_9), where a_9 is the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reindex this. Let me try again.\n\nLet me denote each layer starting from the innermost as layer 1, then each layer outward as layer 2, layer 3, etc., up to layer 9, and then the outermost is layer 10.\n\nWait, that might be a better way. Let me try that.\n\nSo, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524: Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, that gives 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3*29,524 is 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the total expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake in these calculations.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a recurrence relation. Each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, solving this recurrence relation might give me a formula to compute a_n directly, which could be faster for larger n, but in this case, since n is only 9, computing step by step is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me try that. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + C,\n\nwhere C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find C by solving a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a particular solution is a constant C. Then,\n\nC = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that confirms that the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my recurrence relation approach again because I might have confused the indexing. Since a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 4, and each subsequent a_n is built outward, then yes, a_9 would be the value inside the outermost 3*(...), so the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have considered a_0 as the innermost, but in this case, the way I defined it, a_1 is the innermost, so a_9 is the ninth layer outward, which is inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*(29,524):\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, that gives 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

    "text": " That sounds like a plan. So, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last (1+3), right? So, starting from the inside, I can compute each layer one by one. Let me write this out step by step to keep track.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: (1 + 3)\n   That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, looking at the original problem, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, let me represent each step as a separate computation.\n\nLet me number each step from the innermost to the outermost. So, let's define each layer as follows:\n\n- Layer 1: (1 + 3)\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- And so on, until Layer 9, since I count nine layers here.\n\nWait, let me check. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times this happens. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each (1 + 3(...)) is a layer. Let me count:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3*(Layer 1)), which is Layer 2.\n3. Then, (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) is Layer 3.\n4. Continuing this way, each time we add a layer by multiplying 3 and adding 1.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3(...)) is a new layer. The original expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), so I think there are 9 layers here. Wait, let me count again.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The first (1 + 3) is Layer 1.\n- Then, each time we go out, we add another layer. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first closing parenthesis. Wait, perhaps another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each \"1 + 3(...)\" as a term, and each time we go out, we have another such term, so perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me confirm by writing them down:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but looking back, the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times ...), so perhaps the outermost factor is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, total layers inside the 3 are 9, each being 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, let me structure this as:\n\nCompute Layer 1 to Layer 9, then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer 8, and so on. So, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check my calculations again, because that seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go through each layer again to make sure.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the final expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems quite large. Let me check if I have the correct number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is a layer. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)):\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have (1 + 3(...)), so how many times does that occur? Let's see:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1.\n2. Then, moving out, each time we have another (1 + 3(...)), so that's Layer 2, Layer 3, up to Layer 9.\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if the final step is correct. The problem says to compute 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big number, so I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern here that I can model with a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might help verify my result.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's of the form Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer (n-1).\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me write it down:\n\nLayer 1 = 4.\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*Layer (n-1), for n >= 2.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\nLayer n = A*3^n + B,\n\nwhere A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nLayer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, it would be:\n\nLayer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, since each layer is a geometric progression.\n\nWait, considering that Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, so for n=9, Layer 9 = (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute Layer 9 again using the formula:\n\nLayer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid.

    "text": " That makes sense because each part inside the parentheses depends on the next one, so starting from the inside should help me build up the solution step by step.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so there are nine sets of parentheses here, each containing 1 plus 3 times the next set. That means I need to start solving from the innermost one and work my way out. Let me assign each level a number to keep track. I'll number them from the inside out as levels 1 to 9.\n\nSo, Level 1: 1 + 3  \nLevel 2: 1 + 3(Level 1)  \nLevel 3: 1 + 3(Level 2)  \n... and so on, up to Level 9.\n\nWait, but actually, looking again, the very innermost part is Level 9, right? Because each level is wrapped inside the previous one. So maybe I should start with Level 9 and move outward. Let me clarify that.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses. Each \"1 + 3(...\" is a new level. Let's see: starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), that's Level 1. Then each step out adds another level. So, there are 9 levels in total, with Level 9 being the outermost one. Wait, no, actually, let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's see: starting from the left, the first term is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... So, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new level. Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are 9 levels, with Level 1 being the innermost and Level 9 being the outermost. So, I need to compute Level 1 first, then Level 2, and so on until Level 9.\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ...). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Then each step out adds another 1 + 3 times that. So, let me start by computing the innermost parentheses first.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nThen, Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4  \nWait, that's 1 + 12 = 13  \nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have miscounted the levels. Let me make sure that each level corresponds correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this more systematically. Let me try to write each level step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each level as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3  \nL2 = 1 + 3*L1  \nL3 = 1 + 3*L2  \n...  \nL9 = 1 + 3*L8  \nAnd the final result is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, the outermost 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which would be L9. So, yes, the final result is 3*L9.\n\nSo, let's compute each level step by step:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4  \nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524  \n*       3  \n= ?\n\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1  \n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7  \n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1  \n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2  \n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8  \nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29,524  \n*       3  \n= 88,572.\n\nYes, because 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, and 29,524 is 476 less than 30,000, so 476*3=1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, no, actually, 30,000 - 29,524 is 476, so 29,524 is 30,000 - 476. Therefore, 29,524 * 3 = (30,000 * 3) - (476 * 3) = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. That's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each level. Let me go through each level again.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't miscount the levels. Let me count the number of times I applied the 1 + 3*(...) structure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3  \nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)  \nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)  \n...  \nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8)  \nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9).\n\nYes, that's 9 levels, so L9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each level seems to be following a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. Let me try that.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition. When n = 1, L(1) = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nNow, let's see the next term. L(2) = 1 + 3*L(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the general solution for n=2:\n\n13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nNow, we have a system of equations:\n\n3A + B = 4  \n9A + B = 13\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4  \n6A = 9  \nA = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A back into the first equation:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4  \n9/2 + B = 4  \nB = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values we computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what we got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step checks out, and the general formula for the recurrence also confirms the result. So, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by expanding the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each level is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous level. After computing each level up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Compute Innermost Parentheses (Level 1):**\n   - \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n2. **Compute Level 2:**\n   - \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n\n3. **Compute Level 3:**\n   - \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n\n4. **Compute Level 4:**\n   - \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n\n5. **Compute Level 5:**\n   - \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n\n6. **Compute Level 6:**\n   - \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n\n7. **Compute Level 7:**\n   - \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n\n8. **Compute Level 8:**\n   - \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n\n9. **Compute Level 9:**\n   - \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n10. **Multiply by 3 to Get Final Result:**\n    - \\( 3 \\times L_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each time I worked through a layer, I moved one step out. Let me check if I did all nine layers correctly because the original expression has eight sets of parentheses, I think. Wait, no, let me recount.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3) as the first layer, then each time I go out, that's a new layer. So, the original expression has eight layers, right? Let me check:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Then 3*(result)\n3. Next: 1 + (result)\n4.

Finally, 3*(result)\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me see: Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, and each time I go out, I have another layer. So, starting from the innermost, let me count how many times I have \"1 + 3(...)\".\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(...)\" terms. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost one.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count how many layers there are. Each time we have a 1 + 3(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each \"1+\" is a new layer.

So, I think I went one layer too far earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, starting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8). So, 3*9841.\n\nWait, but in my initial counting, I went up to Layer 9, which might have been incorrect because the original expression has 8 layers of \"1+3(...)\", so the outermost 3 multiplies the result of the 8th layer.\n\nSo, let me recast it:\n\nCompute each layer step by step, from Layer 1 to Layer 8, then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841.\n\nSo, let me compute 3*9841.\n\nFirst, 9841 * 3:\n\nLet me compute 9840 * 3 = 29520\n\nThen, 1 * 3 = 3\n\nSo, 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final result is 29523.\n\nBut let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*9841 = 29523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I went up to Layer 9, I got 29523 as well, so maybe my initial counting was correct, but I miscounted the layers. Alternatively, perhaps the original expression has 9 layers because each \"1+\" is a new layer, starting from the innermost. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a new layer, and the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears, which is 9 times. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...)\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\", meaning 9 layers. So, perhaps my initial count was correct, and the final answer is 29523. But let me make sure.\n\nWait, when I counted the layers earlier, I went up to Layer 9, which gave me 29523, but then I thought maybe the original expression only had 8 layers, so I stopped at Layer 8, which gave me 9841, and then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me approach this differently. Let me count the number of \"1+\" terms. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and a parenthesis. So, in the original expression, how many \"1+\" are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, each layer adds another \"1+3\"\n\nSo, let me count:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to how many? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+\" after the initial 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1+\"s:\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...)\n\nWait, that's 9 \"1+\"s, but each one is inside the previous, so the number of layers is 9. Therefore, when I compute each layer, I should go up to Layer 9, then multiply by 3 at the end.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, after computing up to Layer 9, I had 29523, which was the result of 3*(Layer 8). So, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, until Layer 9, which is just 1 + 3.\n\nWait, no, that can't be, because the innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost \"1+3(...)\", and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the total number of layers is 9, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, that's different from before. Wait, so earlier I thought the entire expression was 3*(Layer 8), but if Layer 9 is the outermost, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. Let me make sure I'm counting correctly.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * ... * (1 + 3)...)))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3 * (...)\" is a layer, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another \"1 + 3 * (previous layer)\".\n\nSo, let me count the number of \"1 + 3 * (...)\" terms:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nUp to how many?\n\nWait, the expression has 9 \"1 + 3(\" terms, so that would mean 9 layers. Therefore, Layer 1 is (1 + 3), Layer 2 is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)), ..., Layer 9 is (1 + 3*(Layer 8)), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, so that would make the final computation 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's a different result than before. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the number of layers. Let me try to count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...)\n\nSo, there are 9 \"1+3(\" terms, meaning 9 layers, each nested inside the previous one. Therefore, Layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), Layer 2 is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)), ..., Layer 9 is (1 + 3*(Layer 8)), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, let me compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's different from my earlier result of 29523 because I had miscounted the number of layers. So, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought the expression was 3*(Layer 8), which gave me 29523, but that was incorrect because I didn't account for the fact that the original expression has 9 layers, so the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), not 3*(Layer 8).\n\nWait, let me see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another \"1 + 3*(...)\", up to Layer 9, which is the outermost \"1 + 3*(...)\", and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, yes, 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. I remember that expressions like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants.\n\nPlugging in the recurrence:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume solution a_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, a_{n} = A*3^n + B\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 being 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 9 layers and ended up with 88572, but in my initial step-by-step computation, I thought it was 29523. That was because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more by computing each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer as we go.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That sounds like a plan.\n\nAlright, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the expression, it's 1+3(1+3(...)) and so on. So the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nWait, no, hold on. The innermost part is actually (1 + 3), which is 4, right? But then that 4 is multiplied by 3 in the next layer. Hmm, maybe I should work from the inside out, calculating each layer step by step.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so let me count them. Starting from the left, I see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is a layer, and it's multiplied by 3 each time. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result of layer 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result of layer 2)\n...\nUp to 9 layers, I think. Let me check: Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So starting from the first 3, there are 9 sets of parentheses, each adding another layer. So, 9 layers in total.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo from the first 3, each subsequent term is 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. First: (1+3(...\n2. Second: (1+3(...\n3. Third: (1+3(...\n4. Fourth: (1+3(...\n5. Fifth: (1+3(...\n6. Sixth: (1+3(...\n7. Seventh: (1+3(...\n8. Eighth: (1+3(...\n9. Ninth: (1+3(...))\nWait, but actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), that's layer 1. Then moving outward, each previous layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by starting from the innermost and working outward. So, let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, with 1 being the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, wait, that seems too big. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me take it step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(...). So after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, I have to multiply that result by 3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1.

Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, layer 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to layer 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to layer 9, I got 29524, but then the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So the final result would be 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems too large.

So, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nThis expression resembles a geometric series. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and the solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by expanding each layer step by step.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me just confirm 3^10 is indeed 59049.\n\nYes, 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more using another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplications.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, perhaps I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the approach works.\n\nFor example, let's take a smaller expression with only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Then 3*a_2=39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))).\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 =4.\n\nNext layer: 1 +3*4=13.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*13=40.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*40=120.\n\nUsing the formula: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Then 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the 9-layer case.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe identify that each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result of the previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the outermost layer, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " That usually works well with these kinds of nested expressions. So, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down. So, starting from the inside: \n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, the innermost parentheses simplify to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives 13. Okay, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, and adding 1 gives 40. So, that layer is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me continue this process step by step to make sure I'm on the right track. Next layer out: 1 + 3*40. 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay, that's 121. Next, 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, that's 364. Then, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let me calculate that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, that layer is 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, that's 3280. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. That layer is 9841. Next, the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3 is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, that entire inner expression simplifies to 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do multiple steps, especially with larger numbers, it's easy to slip up. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then 1+3*4=13. Then 1+3*13=40. Then 1+3*40=121. Then 1+3*121=364. Then 1+3*364=1093. Then 1+3*1093=3280. Then 1+3*3280=9841. Then 1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer step by step, which might be more efficient and less error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the closed-form can be found using the formula. In this case, c is 3 and d is 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_0 - d/(c-1)) * c^n + d/(c-1). Wait, let me verify that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*c^n, where A is a constant. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = c*K + d. Solving for K: K - c*K = d => K*(1 - c) = d => K = d/(1 - c). So, the general solution is a_n = A*c^n + K. Applying initial conditions: when n=0, a_0 = A + K. But in our case, the first term is a_1 = 4. So, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the number of layers. Let me count how many layers there are. Looking back at the original expression, the innermost is (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), and moving outward, each layer is one more. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 opening parentheses, so that means 9 layers. So, n=9. So, a_9 is the value we're looking for before multiplying by the outermost 3. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had a_1=4, a_2=13, up to a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. So, if I can model this as a recurrence relation with n=9, then perhaps I can find a formula for a_n. As I thought earlier, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Alternatively, since the innermost is a_1=4, and each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, to find a closed-form, let's write down the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, to find a closed-form, let's solve the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = (a_1 - K) * 3^{n-1} + K, where K is the particular solution.\n\nAs I found earlier, K = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (4 - (-1/2)) * 3^{n-1} + (-1/2) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: (9/2)*3^{n-1} = (9/2)*(3^{n}/3) = (3^{n+1})/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3 multiplied by a sum that involves multiple layers of 3s and 1s. But since I've already broken it down step by step and verified it with both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing one more layer manually. Let's say, compute a_4 using the formula. a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier computation. So, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). By simplifying each layer starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, we can compute the value step by step.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Next Layer**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Next: (1 + 3*265720) = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n\n13. Finally, 3*797161 = 2,391,483\n\nWait a second, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has multiple layers, so I want to make sure I accounted for each one correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, it's a new layer. So starting from the innermost, each step I took accounted for one layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)). So the original expression has 9 layers of (1+3(...)), right? Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3*(...)), and each time we go out a layer, so starting from 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on, up to 9 layers. Wait, but in my steps above, I went through 13 steps, but maybe that's because I included the initial 3* at the end. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the expression to see how many layers there are. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is one layer, and each subsequent layer adds another (1+3*(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nWait, actually, each time the expression is 1 + 3*(...), so each time we have a new layer. Let me count how many times \"1+\" appears inside the expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)), so:\n\n- Layer 2: (1 + 3*(layer1))\n- Layer 3: (1 + 3*(layer2))\n- ...\n- Up to layer 9, because the original expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but in my previous steps, I ended up with 13 computations, which seems too many. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me write down the layers properly.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote L1 as the innermost layer:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, I should have 9 layers, each building upon the previous. Let me compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous computation. So, according to this, the final result is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n3 * 20,000 = 60,000\n\n3 * 9,000 = 27,000 \u2192 total so far 87,000\n\n3 * 500 = 1,500 \u2192 total 88,500\n\n3 * 24 = 72 \u2192 total 88,572\n\nWait, that's 88,572. But earlier, I thought it was 2,391,483. That's a big discrepancy. So, clearly, I must have made a mistake in the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time there's a (1 + 3(...)), and each time it's nested inside another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so let's count the number of times we have (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so let me count how many times that occurs.\n\nLet me write it down:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) instances.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...)) where ... is (1 + 3)\n3. (1 + 3(...)) where ... is (1 + 3(...))\n...\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because the innermost is (1 + 3), and each time you go out, you add another layer, so with 9 layers, you have 9 (1 + 3(...)) expressions.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I ended up with L9 = 29,524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88,572, but that doesn't match my initial computation where I went up to 797,161. So, clearly, I must have miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct number of layers is 9, so L9 = 29,524, and the final result is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nBut let me confirm by counting the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions in the original problem.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\nThen, each time you move out, you have another (1 + 3(...)), so let me count how many times (1 + 3(...)) occurs.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. The innermost: (1 + 3)\n\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3(...)) where ... is the innermost (1 + 3)\n\n3. Next: (1 + 3(...)) where ... is the previous layer\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the outermost layer before the initial 3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time you have a new layer, so let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions.\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach (1 + 3(...) starts a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nAfter the initial 3, the first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3(...))\n\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n\n...\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of times \"1+\" appears inside the expression, excluding the initial 3.\n\nLet me look at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is the start of a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first \"1+\" is at the start of the first innermost layer: (1 + 3)\n\n2. Then, each subsequent \"1+\" starts a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times the pattern (1 + 3(...) occurs. Each time you have (1 + 3(...)), that's a new layer. Let me count how many times this occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3)\n- Then, moving out, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so let's count how many times we have (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, with each layer building upon the previous one.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let me compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29,524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 total so far 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 total 88,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72 \u2192 total 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial computation where I ended up with 2,391,483. So, clearly, I must have miscounted the layers earlier. It seems the correct number of layers is 9, leading to the result 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write the expression again and count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) instances:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, each time adding another (1 + 3(...)).\n\nTherefore, L9 = 29,524, and the final result is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to layer 12, which was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct approach is to compute 9 layers, leading to 29,524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nLet me confirm this with a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nEach layer follows the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me substitute into the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B\n\nThen, L_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n = 9.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^{10} = 59,049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 13 layers, but now I'm confident it's 9 layers, leading to 88,572. So, I must have miscounted the layers before.\n\nLet me just recapitulate to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.\n\nUsing the closed-form solution:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nFor n = 9,\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the number of layers, which led me to an incorrect result. But by using the closed-form solution, I can be confident that 9 layers give me L_9 = 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nSo, to wrap up, the steps are:\n\n1. Recognize the nested pattern and define each layer recursively.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n3. Alternatively, use the closed-form solution to find L_n for n = 9.\n\n4. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with a repeating pattern. By recognizing the recursive structure and computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value of each layer and ultimately compute the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form (1 + 3*(previous term)). The innermost term is (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n   - Layer 2: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n   - Layer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n   - Layer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n   - Layer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n   - Layer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n   - Layer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n   - Layer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n   - Layer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\n3. **Final Computation**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nAlright, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last term, which is 1+3. So, maybe I can compute that first and then work my way outwards. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost parentheses to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that simplifies the next set of parentheses to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the expression becomes 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, that's 40. So, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(40). Let's see what that is:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nOkay, so now we have 121. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(121). Let me compute that:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nAlright, so now that's 364. Next layer out is 1 + 3*(364). Let me do that:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWow, that's getting big. Moving out another layer, the expression becomes 1 + 3*(1093). Let me calculate that:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nOkay, so that's 3280. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(3280). Let's see:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWow, that's a huge number. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, the final step is:\n\nOutermost layer: 3*(9841) = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 times 9000 is 27000, and 3 times 841 is 2523. So, adding those together, 27000 + 2523 = 29523.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 9841 times 3. Let me break it down:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nNow, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the previous steps because sometimes when you have a lot of layers, it's easy to make an error. Let me recount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count the number of times I've computed a layer:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (that's the first layer)\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (second layer)\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (third layer)\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (fourth layer)\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (fifth layer)\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (sixth layer)\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (seventh layer)\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (eighth layer)\n9. 3*(9841) = 29523 (outermost layer)\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, which is the ninth layer. So, I think I did that correctly. Let me just verify each step again quickly.\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 3*9841 = 29523 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step checks out. So, the final result is 29,523. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here? Each time, it's 1 + 3*previous result. So, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's see:\n\nLet me denote a_n as the nth term, where n starts from 0. So, a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_8 = 3*a_7 = 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, so maybe that's a_8. Alternatively, perhaps I should model it as a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9, and then multiply by 3. Wait, no, because the outermost operation is the 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), so maybe the innermost is a_1, then a_2, up to a_9, and then the final result is 3*a_9. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The way I did it before, computing from the innermost parentheses outward, seems correct and gives me 29,523. Let me just make sure that I didn't miss any layers. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n9. 3*(1 + 3))\n\nSo, there are nine layers of 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which means I need to compute nine layers, starting from the innermost. So, each step I took corresponds to one layer. So, I think my computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try solving this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nD - 3*D = 1 \u21d2 -2D = 1 \u21d2 D = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n starts at 0: a_0 = 4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 \u21d2 C - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=0: (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nFor n=1: (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=2: (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=3: (9/2)*27 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=4: (9/2)*81 - 1/2 = 729/2 - 1/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=5: (9/2)*243 - 1/2 = 2187/2 - 1/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=6: (9/2)*729 - 1/2 = 6561/2 - 1/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=7: (9/2)*2187 - 1/2 = 19683/2 - 1/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=8: (9/2)*6561 - 1/2 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, but earlier I got 29523. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let me compute a_8 using the formula: a_8 = (9/2)*3^8 - 1/2.\n\n3^8 is 6561, so:\n\na_8 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2 = (9*6561)/2 - 1/2.\n\nCompute 9*6561: 6561*9. Let me compute that:\n\n6561 * 9:\n\n6000*9 = 54,000\n\n500*9 = 4,500\n\n60*9 = 540\n\n1*9 = 9\n\nAdding them up: 54,000 + 4,500 = 58,500; 58,500 + 540 = 59,040; 59,040 + 9 = 59,049.\n\nSo, 9*6561 = 59,049.\n\nThus, a_8 = 59,049/2 - 1/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got 9841 for a_7, and then 3*9841 = 29,523. But according to the formula, a_8 should be 29,524. That suggests that I made a mistake in my step-by-step computation.\n\nWait, let me go back to the step-by-step computation and check where I might have gone wrong.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nBut according to the formula, a_8 should be 29,524, which suggests that I missed a step or miscalculated the final multiplication.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of 3*(1+3*...):\n\n1. The outermost is 3*(...\n2. Inside that is 3*(...\n3. Then another 3*(...\n4. And so on, until the innermost is 1+3.\n\nSo, how many 3*(... are there? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3*( is the outermost, then each subsequent 3*( is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3*(:\n\n1. 3*(1+3*(...\n2. 3*(1+3*(...\n3. 3*(1+3*(...\n4. 3*(1+3*(...\n5. 3*(1+3*(...\n6. 3*(1+3*(...\n7. 3*(1+3*(...\n8. 3*(1+3*(...\n9. 3*(1+3)\n\nSo, there are nine layers of 3*(, meaning that the innermost is the 9th layer, which is 1+3=4. Then, each layer is built by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step computation, I had 9 layers leading to 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29,523. But according to the formula, a_8 is 29,524. So, perhaps the issue is that the formula counts a_0 as the innermost, while in my step-by-step, I started with a_1 as the innermost.\n\nLet me see: If I define a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 13, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 40, etc., up to a_8 = 29,524. Then, the outermost operation is 3*a_8, which would be 3*29,524 = 88,572. But that doesn't match my earlier result.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misaligning the indices. Alternatively, maybe the formula I derived is for a_n where n corresponds to the number of layers after the initial 3. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2 gives the value after n layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, for n=8, that would be the innermost expression, and then the outermost 3* would be applied to a_8, giving 3*a_8 = 3*((9/2)*3^8 - 1/2) = (27/2)*3^8 - 3/2. But that seems more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with eight layers inside. So, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8, and then the outermost expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the formula a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2 would give a_9 = (9/2)*3^9 - 1/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^9 = 19,683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (9/2)*19,683 - 1/2 = (9*19,683)/2 - 1/2.\n\nCompute 9*19,683:\n\n19,683 * 9:\n\n10,000*9 = 90,000\n\n9,000*9 = 81,000\n\n600*9 = 5,400\n\n80*9 = 720\n\n3*9 = 27\n\nAdding up: 90,000 + 81,000 = 171,000; 171,000 + 5,400 = 176,400; 176,400 + 720 = 177,120; 177,120 + 27 = 177,147.\n\nSo, a_9 = 177,147/2 - 1/2 = (177,147 - 1)/2 = 177,146/2 = 88,573.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*88,573 = 265,719. But that's way larger than my earlier result, so I must be misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the indices. Let me try to clearly define the problem.\n\nThe original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is: 3*( layer1 ), where layer1 is 1 + 3*( layer2 ), and so on until layer9 is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, layer9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nlayer8: 1 + 3*layer9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nlayer7: 1 + 3*layer8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nlayer6: 1 + 3*layer7 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nlayer5: 1 + 3*layer6 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nlayer4: 1 + 3*layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nlayer3: 1 + 3*layer4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nlayer2: 1 + 3*layer3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nlayer1: 1 + 3*layer2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*layer1 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I ended up with 29,523. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me recount the layers properly. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer9: 4.\n\nThen, layer8: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nlayer7: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nlayer6: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nlayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nlayer4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nlayer3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nlayer2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nlayer1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so in my initial step-by-step, I think I miscounted the layers. I stopped at layer2: 9841, then multiplied by 3 to get 29,523, but that's incorrect because there are more layers. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because in the original expression, the structure is 3*(layer1), where layer1 is 1 + 3*(layer2), and so on. So, the layers go from layer9 up to layer1, and then the outermost is 3*layer1.\n\nWait, so in my initial computation, I went from layer9 up to layer1, which is 29,524, and then the outermost is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nBut that's conflicting with my earlier step-by-step where I thought I had only 9 layers leading to 9841, then 3*9841=29,523. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers in the original expression.\n\nWait, let me write out the original expression with indices to clarify:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 3*(...:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n9. 3*(1 + 3)\n\nSo, there are nine 3*(... expressions. Therefore, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, and working outward, we have nine layers, each time computing 1 + 3*previous.\n\nSo, layer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nlayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nlayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nlayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nlayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nlayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nlayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nlayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nlayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*layer9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so that suggests that my initial step-by-step was wrong because I stopped at layer8 and multiplied by 3, but actually, there are nine layers, so the last layer is layer9: 29524, and then the outermost is 3*29524.\n\nBut that contradicts my initial computation where I thought the innermost was layer1 and the outermost was layer9. So, I must have miscounted the layers in the original expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from how I'm indexing the layers. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that each time I encounter a 3*(1 + 3*(...)), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, no, that's not right because 3*9841 is 29523, so Layer9 would be 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would correspond to Layer1 being the innermost and Layer9 being the outermost. So, perhaps my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I stopped at Layer8 and multiplied by 3, whereas in reality, the outermost is 3*Layer9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3*(, each subsequent 3*( adds a new layer. So, the first 3*( is the outermost, and the innermost is the ninth 3*(1 + 3). So, that means there are nine layers, each corresponding to a 3*(...). Therefore, the computation should go up to Layer9 and then the outermost is 3*Layer9.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the final result is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is 29524, giving 88,572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed up to Layer8 as 9841 and then multiplied by 3, I got 29,523, which is different.\n\nI think the confusion arises from how I'm indexing the layers. Let me try to clearly define the layers:\n\nLet me define E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, E = 3*(Layer1), where Layer1 = 1 + 3*(Layer2), Layer2 = 1 + 3*(Layer3), and so on, until Layer9 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, Layer9 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer8 = 1 + 3*Layer9 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer7 = 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer6 = 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5 = 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer4 = 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer3 = 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer2 = 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer1 = 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*Layer1 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, so that's the correct computation, right? So, my initial mistake was stopping at Layer8 and multiplying by 3, but actually, there's one more layer beyond that, making it Layer9, and then the outermost is 3*Layer9.\n\nBut wait, in the original expression, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 3*(...). So, that would mean that Layer1 is the outermost, and Layer9 is the innermost. Therefore, Layer1 = 1 + 3*Layer2, Layer2 = 1 + 3*Layer3, ..., Layer9 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo, starting from Layer9:\n\nLayer9 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer8 = 1 + 3*Layer9 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer7 = 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer6 = 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5 = 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer4 = 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer3 = 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer2 = 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer1 = 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, E = 3*Layer1 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to Layer8 as 9841 and then multiplied by 3, giving 29,523, but that's missing the last layer. So, I must have miscounted the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the original expression has eight layers of 3*(...), not nine. Let me check again:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3*( after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n4. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n5. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n6. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n7. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n8. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n9. 3*(1 + 3)\n\nSo, there are nine instances of 3*(, which would mean nine layers. Therefore, the correct computation should go up to Layer9 and then multiply by 3, giving 88,572.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with my initial computation where I thought the innermost was Layer1 and the outermost was Layer9, but perhaps I was miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the initial 3* is the outermost, and then each subsequent 3*( adds a new layer inward. So, the innermost is Layer9, and the outermost is Layer1, with E = 3*Layer1.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to compute up to Layer9 and then multiply by 3.\n\nBut let me try to resolve this confusion by writing out the layers clearly:\n\n1. Layer9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Layer8: 1 + 3*Layer9 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n3. Layer7: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n4. Layer6: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n5. Layer5: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n6. Layer4: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n7. Layer3: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n8. Layer2: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n9. Layer1: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n10. E = 3*Layer1 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my initial step"

Let me check that again. So, step 2 was 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then step 3 is 1 + 3*13. So, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That seems correct.\n\nStep 4: Compute (1 + 3*(40)) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, that's 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, that's correct.\n\nStep 5: Compute (1 + 3*(121)) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nStep 6: Compute (1 + 3*(364)) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWait, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nStep 7: Compute (1 + 3*(1093)) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nStep 8: Compute (1 + 3*(3280)) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nStep 9: Compute (1 + 3*(9841)) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers.\n\nLet me go through each step again more carefully.\n\nStep 1: Innermost is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nStep 2: Next layer is (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: Next is (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: Next is (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: Next is (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: Next is (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: Next is (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: Next is (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: Next is (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. Each time I compute a step, I'm moving one layer out, starting from the innermost. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3*... terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 4\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me see:\n\nAfter step 1: 4\n\nThen step 2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nStep 4:1 + 3*40=121\n\nStep 5:1 + 3*121=364\n\nStep 6:1 + 3*364=1093\n\nStep 7:1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nStep 8:1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nStep 9:1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, right? Because starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. So, 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...) before we get to the outermost 3*(...). So, the final step is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I actually have 9 layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(...). The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3*... is a layer. Let me count the number of 1 + 3*... terms. Each time we have 1 + 3*(something), that's a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n4. (1 + 3*(...))\n5. (1 + 3*(...))\n6. (1 + 3*(...))\n7. (1 + 3*(...))\n8. (1 + 3*(...))\n9. (1 + 3*(...))\n\nWait, but the innermost is (1 + 3), which is step 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, from step 1 to step 9, that's 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is step 9, which is 1 + 3*(step8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(step9). So, yes, 9 layers, and the final result is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each step manually, especially since this could be time-consuming and error-prone with so many layers.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, let's define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a formula for a geometric series or something similar here. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify to find a general formula, just to compute the given expression, either method works. But computing step by step seems straightforward, though time-consuming.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many 1 + 3*(...) are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(...). Each 1 + 3*(... is a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 layer 1\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(layer1))\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*(layer2))\n\n...\n\nUp to layer9: (1 + 3*(layer8))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer9).\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and 3*a_9=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again quickly:\n\na1=4\n\na2=1+3*4=13\n\na3=1+3*13=40\n\na4=1+3*40=121\n\na5=1+3*121=364\n\na6=1+3*364=1093\n\na7=1+3*1093=3280\n\na8=1+3*3280=9841\n\na9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a9=88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm the same result.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\), and each subsequent layer is \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).

    "text": " That makes sense because each parenthesis depends on the one inside it, so I can't compute the outer ones until I know the value of the inner ones.\n\nLet me start by writing down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, so each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another expression). Let me try to count how many layers there are here. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3 times (1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so that means there are nine layers here. So, I'll need to compute starting from the innermost one and work my way out.\n\nLet me try to structure this. Let's denote each layer as a step. Let's say the innermost part is step 1, then each step going outward adds another layer. So, step 1 is (1 + 3). Then step 2 is 3*(1 + step1), step 3 is 3*(1 + step2), and so on, up to step 9, which is the outermost layer. Then, the final result would be step9 multiplied by 3, but wait, looking back at the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(...), so maybe step9 is already the innermost part, and the outermost is 3*(step9). Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which itself contains another 1 + 3*(...), and so on, nine times. So perhaps I should index these layers starting from the innermost as layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 would be layer 10? Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nSo, let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Starting from the innermost, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Let me see: from the innermost, each layer is a 3*(1 + ...), so how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing up to Layer9, which is 36084, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), right? Wait no, because Layer9 is the outermost 3*(...), so maybe the expression is just Layer9, which is 36084. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as Layer1, then each layer is 3*(1 + Layer(n-1)). So, let me see:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, Layer9 is the outermost layer, which is 36084. Therefore, the entire expression is 36084. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly. The original expression has nine layers of 3*(1 + ...), so I think I did nine layers, each time computing Layer(n) = 3*(1 + Layer(n-1)), starting from Layer1 = 4.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculation.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Now, 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So, 300+120=420, +24=444. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let's compute 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So, 1200+120=1320, +15=1335. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So, 3000+900=3900, +90=3990, +18=4008. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Compute 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So, 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3. 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84. So, 36000+84=36084. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems to compute correctly. Therefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...):\n\nStarting from the innermost, after (1+3), each layer is a 3*(1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me write the expression with indices:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer1, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + Layer(n-1)), up to Layer9. So, yes, Layer9 is the outermost, which is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, each term is generated by a recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A => (8/2 + 3/2) = 3A => 11/2 = 3A => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 = (11*3^{n}) / (6) = (11*3^{n-1}) / 2\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1}) / 2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nAlternatively, factor out 1/2:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*3^2 - 3)/2 = (11*9 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Wait, no, 11*81 is 891? Wait, 11*80=880, plus 11=891. Yes, so 891 -3=888, divided by 2 is 444. Correct.\n\nWait, but when n=4, a_4 is 147 according to our earlier calculation. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, when n=4, a_4 is 147? Wait, no, in my earlier step-by-step, a_4 was 147, but according to the formula, a_4 = (11*3^{4-1} - 3)/2 = (11*27 -3)/2 = (297 -3)/2=294/2=147. Correct. So, yes, it works.\n\nSimilarly, a_5 = (11*81 -3)/2 = (891 -3)/2=888/2=444. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (11*3^{8} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*6561 -3)/2.\n\nCompute 11*6561:\n\nLet me compute 10*6561 = 65,610, plus 1*6561 = 6,561, so total is 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171.\n\nThen, subtract 3: 72,171 -3 = 72,168.\n\nDivide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084, which matches our earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\nWait, but the original problem was 3*(...), which is exactly a_9, so the answer is 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as 36084, but I think 36,084 is more readable.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any layers. The original expression has nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, n=9, so a_9=36,084.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nEach layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), which is a linear recurrence.\n\nBut since I've already solved it using the recurrence relation and got 36,084, and verified it step by step, I think that's solid.\n\nSo, the final answer is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the given expression is \\(\\boxed{36084}\\)."

    "text": " That usually works well with nested expressions. Let me try to write this out step by step, starting from the innermost part. The innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so the innermost parentheses simplify to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3*(previous result)). Since the innermost was 4, the next one would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another level, we have another (1 + 3*previous result). The previous result was 13, so 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that level simplifies to 40. Let me write this down so I don't lose track. So far, we have:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nHmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, adding 1, and that gives me the next value. Let me continue this process step by step. The next level out would be (1 + 3*40). Let's compute that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121. Next, moving out another layer: (1 + 3*121). Calculating that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that's 364. Continuing: (1 + 3*364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Then, (1 + 3*3280). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Now, moving out another layer: (1 + 3*9841). Let me calculate that: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is (1 + 3*29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. So, now, the entire expression inside the first set of parentheses simplifies to 88573. But wait, the original problem is 3 multiplied by that entire expression. So, the problem is 3*(88573). Let me compute that: 3*88573. Let me do this multiplication step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake. 88573 times 3: 3*3 is 9, 3*7 is 21, carry over 2; 3*5 is 15 plus 2 is 17, carry over 1; 3*8 is 24 plus 1 is 25, carry over 2; 3*8 is 24 plus 2 is 26. So, reading the digits from top to bottom, starting from the right, we have 9, 1, 7, 5, 6, 2. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me write it out properly:\n\n88573  \n\u00d7      3  \n---------  \nLet's compute each digit:\n\n- 3*3 = 9, write down 9.\n- 3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2.\n- 3*5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n- 3*8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2. But since there are no more digits, we write down 26.\n\nWait, that would give us 265719, right? Let me check: 88573 * 3. Let me compute 88,573 * 3. 80,000 * 3 = 240,000. 8,000 * 3 = 24,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 70 * 3 = 210. 3 * 3 = 9. Now, adding all these together: 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000. 264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500. 265,500 + 210 = 265,710. 265,710 + 9 = 265,719. Yes, that's correct. So, 3*88573 is 265,719. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265,719. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nThen, multiplying this result by 3 gives 265,719. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just verify one of the steps where I might have made an error. For example, step 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That's correct. Step 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Step 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Step 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Step 10: 1 + 3*29524. 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. Correct. Then, 3*88573 is 265,719. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or formula. Let me think. Each time, we're dealing with an expression of the form 1 + 3*(previous expression). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define the terms. Let\u2019s say a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's compute a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4  \na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13  \na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40  \na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121  \na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364  \na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093  \na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280  \na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841  \na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524  \na_{10} = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nYes, that's the same as before. So, the expression given has 9 layers of nesting, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*88573 = 265,719. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's compute A. When n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Wait, but earlier when I computed a_9, I got 29524, which matches. Then, a_{10} would be (3^{11} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147, so a_{10}=(177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573. That matches what I got earlier. So, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, the expression inside the first set of parentheses is a_{10}=88573, and then multiplied by 3 gives 3*88573=265,719. So, that's the final result. Let me just make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations when computing 3^{10} or 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Yes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, a_{10}=(177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573. Correct. Therefore, the initial computation was correct. So, the final answer is 265,719. I think that's solid. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer step by step from the inside out, I was able to simplify the entire expression to 88573, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 265,719. Alternatively, recognizing the recurrence relation allowed me to find a closed-form formula, which confirmed the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By simplifying each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated eight more times, resulting in the outermost expression simplifying to 88573. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{265719}$"

    "text": " That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a (1+3(...)), that's another layer. Let me count: starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then that's inside another (1+3(...)), and so on, until there are nine layers in total. Wait, let me make sure. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the left, each time it's 3 times (1 + 3 times another expression). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, each followed by 1 + 3(...). So, that means there are nine layers. That's a lot, but maybe I can find a pattern or a way to compute it without having to calculate each layer individually. Alternatively, I could compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost one and moving outward. Let me try that approach. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is the ninth layer. Let me write down each layer as I compute it.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Wait, actually, maybe it's better to label them from the innermost as L1 to the outermost as L9. So, L1 is the innermost (1+3), L2 is the next one, and so on up to L9, which is the entire expression. Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (another expression)), so the innermost is (1+3), then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)). So, perhaps I should compute starting from the innermost and work my way out. Let me try that.\n\nSo, let me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet me start with the innermost expression:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, no, hold on. Because each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, actually, Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + Layer1). So, Layer1 is 4, so Layer2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen, Layer3 would be 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me check that again.

The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, Layer9 is the entire expression, which is 3*(1 + Layer8). So, that would be 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has nine opening parentheses after the first 3, so there are nine layers. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nYes, that's nine layers. So, the final result is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did each multiplication correctly.\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each step is correct, so the final answer should be 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 4, as before. Then, a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence as:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for a particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C => 11/2 = 3C => C = 11/(2*3) = 11/6\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1}) - 3/2\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nWait, 3^n is 3*3^{n-1}, so (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3*3^{n-1} = (11/2)*3^{n-1}\n\nSo, a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (11*3^2 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Wait, no, 3^3 is 27, so 11*27=297, 297-3=294, 294/2=147. Correct.\n\nWait, so the formula works. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, the answer is 36,084.\n\nI think that's correct. Both methods, step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_9 \\), where \\( L_1 \\) is the innermost layer.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer \\( L_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer \\( L_2 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_2 = 3 \\times (1 + L_1) = 3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. Compute the next layer \\( L_3 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_3 = 3 \\times (1 + L_2) = 3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. Compute the next layer \\( L_4 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_4 = 3 \\times (1 + L_3) = 3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n\n5. Compute the next layer \\( L_5 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_5 = 3 \\times (1 + L_4) = 3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n\n6. Compute the next layer \\( L_6 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_6 = 3 \\times (1 + L_5) = 3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n\n7. Compute the next layer \\( L_7 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_7 = 3 \\times (1 + L_6) = 3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n\n8. Compute the next layer \\( L_8 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_8 = 3 \\times (1 + L_7) = 3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n\n9. Compute the outermost layer \\( L_9 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_9 = 3 \\times (1 + L_8) = 3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{36084}\\)."

    "text": " That usually works with nested expressions. So, maybe I should start from the very inside and work my way out, simplifying each part as I go. Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, okay, so each time it's 1 plus 3 times another expression. It looks like there are nine sets of parentheses here. Let me count them: starting from the first 3, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that. Let me try to count how many layers there are. Let's see: 1. Innermost: (1 + 3) 2. Next: (1 + 3(...)) where ... is the previous layer 3. Then another layer, and so on, up to nine layers. Wait, no, actually, looking at the expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, maybe there are eight layers because each \"3*\" adds a layer. Let me check: starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and so on, until the outermost 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, each \"1+3(...)\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(...)\" sections. Each time, it's 1+3 times another expression. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me see: 1. Innermost: (1 + 3) 2. Next: 3*(1 + 3) 3. Then: 1 + 3*(previous result) 4. Then 3*(1 + 3*(...)) and so on. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write it step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., up to L9, maybe. Let me try that.\n\nSo, let's define L1 as the innermost expression: L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\nAnd so on, until L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nWait, but looking at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each layer after the first 3 is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, starting with L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a layer, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me count the number of layers. The original expression has 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are eight \"1 + 3*(...)\" layers. Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) - that's the outermost layer, which we can call L1, but maybe it's better to think of the innermost as L1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the innermost as the first layer, so let's see:\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is 3*(result of the ninth layer).\n\nWait, but let's count the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3*(...)\" sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer.\n\nThen, moving outward, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n\n- Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n\n- Then, 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n\n- 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n\n- 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n\n- 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n\n- 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n\n- 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n\n- 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again. How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's see how many \"1+3(\" there are.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...))) - that's the outermost layer, so inside it, there's another layer.\n\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...)).\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(...)), then inside that another (1+3(...)), and so on until the innermost (1+3). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, the first opening parenthesis is at position 2: (1+3(...)), then inside that, another ( at position 5: (1+3(...)), and so on.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(...)) - first layer\n\n2. (1+3(...)) - second layer\n\n3. (1+3(...)) - third layer\n\n4. (1+3(...)) - fourth layer\n\n5. (1+3(...)) - fifth layer\n\n6. (1+3(...)) - sixth layer\n\n7. (1+3(...)) - seventh layer\n\n8. (1+3(...)) - eighth layer\n\n9. (1+3) - ninth layer, but wait, the innermost is (1+3), which is the ninth layer?\n\nWait, no, because each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, and the innermost is just (1+3), so how many layers are there? Let me think differently.\n\nEach time you have a \"1 + 3(\", it's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer, L1.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer adds another \"1 + 3*(...)\", so L2, L3, etc.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears in the expression, excluding the innermost one. Wait, no, the innermost is (1 + 3), so each layer after that is a \"1 + 3*(...)\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. The first one is after the initial 3: 3(1+3(...))\n\n2. Then, inside that, another (1+3(...)).\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3). So, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, the next is (1+3(...)), which is the first \"1+3(\".\n\nThen, inside that, another (1+3(...)), which is the second.\n\nContinuing until the innermost (1+3), which is the ninth \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, no, because each time you have a \"1+3(\", it's a new layer, but the innermost is just (1+3), which doesn't have another \"1+3(\" inside it. So, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" instances, which is eight, because the innermost is just (1+3), not another \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, the first \"1+3(\" is at position 2: 3(1+3(...))\n\nThen, inside that, another \"1+3(\" at position 5: (1+3(...))\n\nThen another at position 8: (1+3(...))\n\nAnd so on, until the innermost, which is (1+3), which doesn't have another \"1+3(\" inside it.\n\nSo, how many \"1+3(\" are there? Let's count:\n\n1. After the initial 3: 3(1+3(...))\n\n2. Inside that: (1+3(...)) - that's the second\n\n3. Inside that: (1+3(...)) - third\n\n4. Inside that: (1+3(...)) - fourth\n\n5. Inside that: (1+3(...)) - fifth\n\n6. Inside that: (1+3(...)) - sixth\n\n7. Inside that: (1+3(...)) - seventh\n\n8. Inside that: (1+3(...)) - eighth\n\nThen, the innermost is (1+3), which is the ninth layer, but it doesn't have another \"1+3(\" inside it.\n\nWait, but each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so if there are eight \"1+3(\" instances, that would mean eight layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the ninth layer.\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers is nine because each time you have a \"1 + 3(\", including the innermost one. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, and the innermost is the first layer, so let's count the number of layers as the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances, which is eight, because the innermost is just (1 + 3), without another \"1 + 3(\" inside it. So, that would mean eight layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from (1 + 3) as the first layer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to L9, which gave me 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But if there are only eight layers, then perhaps I went one layer too far.\n\nLet me try that again, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nSo, let's try to count the number of layers correctly.\n\nThe expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. After the initial 3: 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n\n2. Inside that: 1 + 3*(...))\n\n3. Inside that: 1 + 3*(...))\n\n4. Inside that: 1 + 3*(...))\n\n5. Inside that: 1 + 3*(...))\n\n6. Inside that: 1 + 3*(...))\n\n7. Inside that: 1 + 3*(...))\n\n8. Inside that: 1 + 3*(...))\n\n9. The innermost: 1 + 3\n\nWait, so the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the ninth \"1 + 3\", but it's not inside another \"1 + 3(\", so perhaps the number of layers is eight, with the innermost being the ninth term.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe another approach is better. Let me try to write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but if I count the layers as L1 to L9, that would mean nine layers, but the original expression only has eight \"1 + 3(\" instances after the initial 3. So, perhaps I'm including the initial 3 as a layer, which might not be correct.\n\nWait, the initial 3 is multiplied by the entire expression inside, which is L9. So, perhaps the correct way is that the entire expression is 3*L9, where L9 is the result of the innermost layers. So, if I have L1 = 4, L2 = 13, up to L9 = 29524, then the total is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut let me check if the number of layers is indeed nine. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. The first one is after the initial 3: 3(1+3(...))\n\n2. Inside that, another (1+3(...)) - that's the second\n\n3. Inside that, another (1+3(...)) - third\n\n4. Inside that, another (1+3(...)) - fourth\n\n5. Inside that, another (1+3(...)) - fifth\n\n6. Inside that, another (1+3(...)) - sixth\n\n7. Inside that, another (1+3(...)) - seventh\n\n8. Inside that, another (1+3(...)) - eighth\n\n9. The innermost is (1+3), which is the ninth, but it's not inside another \"1+3(\", so perhaps the number of layers is eight, and the innermost is just the ninth term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to accept that there are nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from (1 + 3) as L1, then L2 up to L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nBut let's check the original expression again. It starts with 3*(...), and inside that, there are eight \"1 + 3(\" instances. So, perhaps the number of layers is eight, with the innermost being (1 + 3), which is L1, then L2 up to L8, and then the entire expression is 3*L8.\n\nWait, that might make more sense. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, if I consider that the innermost is L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L8 = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but that's different from my earlier result. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how many layers there are. Let me try to count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances after the initial 3.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, the first \"1 + 3(\" is at the first layer, then each subsequent layer adds another \"1 + 3(\".\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the initial 3: (1+3(...))\n\n2. Inside that: (1+3(...))\n\n3. Inside that: (1+3(...))\n\n4. Inside that: (1+3(...))\n\n5. Inside that: (1+3(...))\n\n6. Inside that: (1+3(...))\n\n7. Inside that: (1+3(...))\n\n8. Inside that: (1+3(...))\n\n9. The innermost: (1+3)\n\nWait, so there are eight \"1 + 3(\" instances after the initial 3, and the innermost is just (1 + 3). So, that would mean eight layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from (1 + 3) as L1.\n\nWait, but that would mean L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L8 = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nBut wait, in my earlier approach, I had nine layers, which gave me 88572, but that seems inconsistent with the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct number of layers is eight, and the entire expression is 3*L8 = 29523.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it step by step again, carefully counting the layers.\n\nLet me write down each layer step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nBut according to the count of \"1 + 3(\" instances, there are eight after the initial 3, so perhaps L9 is not part of the expression. Wait, but in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is L1, and then each layer adds another \"1 + 3(\", up to eight times, so L8 would be the last layer, and then the entire expression is 3*L8.\n\nBut when I compute up to L8, I get 9841, and 3*9841 = 29523, but that doesn't match the earlier step-by-step.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting the layers. Let me try to parse the expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, the first layer (innermost) is 4.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nThen, 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nThen, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nThen, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's nine layers, with the innermost being L1 = 4, and L9 = 29524.\n\nBut according to the expression, the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances after the initial 3 is eight, which would imply eight layers. So, perhaps I'm including the initial 3 as a layer, which is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial 3 is not part of the layers; it's just the multiplier. So, the expression is 3 times the result of the innermost layers. So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), up to eight layers, making the innermost expression L8 = 9841, then the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier step-by-step, which gave me 88572.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for example, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches.\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches.\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which matches.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, if we have n layers, the value is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers do we have?\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is a_1, then each layer adds another \"1 + 3*(...)\", up to how many?\n\nLet me count the number of layers:\n\nEach time we have a \"1 + 3(\", it's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1, then each layer is a_2, a_3, etc.\n\nIn the original expression, after the initial 3, there are eight \"1 + 3(\" instances, which would mean eight layers, from a_1 up to a_8.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression is a_1 = 4, and the outermost layer is a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed up to a_9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that seems inconsistent.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct number of layers is eight, making a_8 = 9841, and the total expression is 3*9841 = 29523\n\nBut let me check this again.\n\nIf the original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = a_1 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29524\n\nBut the original expression only has eight \"1 + 3(\" after the initial 3, so perhaps the number of layers is eight, meaning a_8 = 9841, and the total expression is 3*a_8 = 29523\n\nBut wait, in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is a_1, then each layer adds another \"1 + 3(\", up to eight layers, making a_8 = 9841, then the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 29523\n\nBut when I compute a_9, that would require nine layers, which would mean the original expression has nine \"1 + 3(\" instances, which it doesn't; it has eight.\n\nTherefore, the correct total expression should be 3*a_8 = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed up to a_9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88572, which seems incorrect because the original expression doesn't have nine layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+"

    "text": " That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down: (1 + 3). That's simple enough. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, I can replace that innermost part with 4. Now, moving one step out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading this correctly. It's 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the inside, each step is 1 plus 3 times the next inner expression. Let me try to write this out step by step.\n\nLet me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. Let's say the innermost is level 1, then the next one is level 2, and so on up to level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. So, starting with level 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, level 2 would be: 1 + 3*(level 1 result). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nMoving on to level 3: 1 + 3*(level 2 result). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(level 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(level 4 result) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(level 5 result) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(level 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(level 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's see, 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(level 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original problem is 3 times this entire expression. So, after computing level 9, which is the outermost parentheses, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 seems a bit high. Let me confirm each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many levels.\n\nStarting from level 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192. 900 + 192 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279. 3000 + 279 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 again. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841. Wait, 841 is 29 squared, which is 29*29. Let me compute 3*841: 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 2400 + 120 = 2520, plus 3 is 2523. So, 3*9841 = 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that again. 3*29524. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 can be broken into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this multiplication another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes breaking it down can lead to errors if I miscompute any part.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from right to left.\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 carried over is 7.\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 carried over is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing all the inner levels up to level 9, which gives 29524, then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each level step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar because each term is multiplied by 3. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier when computing step by step. Good, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each level is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous level. By computing each level step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the outermost expression evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses (Level 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Level 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Level 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Level 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Level 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Level 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\\)\n\n7. **Level 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\\)\n\n8. **Level 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\\)\n\n9. **Level 9 (Outermost):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\\)\n\n10. **Multiply by 3:**  \n    \\(3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " So, maybe I should start by simplifying the innermost part first and then work my way out. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: The very last part is (1+3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 plus 3 is 4. Okay, so now I can replace that innermost part with 4. So, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4))))))))) Hmm, that seems a bit better. Now, the next layer is (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4))))))))). Wait, actually, I think I miscounted the layers. Let me see: Each time I replace the innermost parentheses, I move one layer out. So, starting from the innermost, I had (1+3)=4. Then, moving out, the next layer is (1+3*(that 4)). So, let me correct that.\n\nWait, maybe I should number the layers to keep track. Let's see: There are nine sets of parentheses, so I'll number them from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9. So, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, layer 2: (1 + 3*(layer1)) = (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, layer 2 is 13. Then, layer 3: (1 + 3*(layer2)) = (1 + 3*13). 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, layer3 is 40. Layer4: (1 + 3*(layer3)) = (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, layer4 is 121. Layer5: (1 + 3*(layer4)) = (1 + 3*121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer5 is 364. Layer6: (1 + 3*(layer5)) = (1 + 3*364). Let's compute 3*364: 364*3 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, layer6 is 1093. Layer7: (1 + 3*(layer6)) = (1 + 3*1093). 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer7 is 3280. Layer8: (1 + 3*(layer7)) = (1 + 3*3280). 3*3280: Let's compute that. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. So, layer8 is 9841. Layer9: (1 + 3*(layer8)) = (1 + 3*9841). Let's compute 3*9841: 9841*3. Let me calculate that step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, layer9 is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is 3*(layer9), right? Because the original expression starts with 3 multiplied by the entire nested parentheses. So, the outermost operation is 3*(layer9). So, layer9 is 29524, so 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me verify the multiplication for layer9: 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3:\n\n9*3=27, carryover 2.\n\n8*3=24 +2=26, carryover 2.\n\n4*3=12 +2=14, carryover 1.\n\n1*3=3 +1=4.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n9841\n*    3\n------\n29523\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*9841 is indeed 29523, plus 1 gives 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscalculated earlier because 29524*3: Let's do it another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 *3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3(1+3(1+3(... nine times ...))). So, each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, then multiplying by 3 again, and so on.\n\nBut maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis looks like a geometric series or something similar. Each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, a_1 is (1+3)=4, then a_2=1+3*a_1=1+12=13, a_3=1+3*a_2=1+39=40, and so on, as I computed earlier.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula, which might be easier than computing each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^{1} -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me check the original expression: It starts with 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))) and there are nine sets of parentheses. So, the innermost is layer1, then layer2 up to layer9.\n\nWait, but in the recurrence, a_1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is (1+3)=4. Then, a_2 is the next layer, etc., up to a_9, which is the result of the innermost nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have saved time. But since I was working it out manually, it's good that both methods agree.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form formula, which confirms that the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That sounds like a plan.\n\nSo, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at the problem, the innermost part is the last \"1+3\". Let me write that down. So, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3\n   - That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, let's compute that:\n\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n   - We just found that the innermost is 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4\n   - 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13.\n\nAlright, moving another level out, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me compute that:\n\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n   - Step 2 gave us 13, so this is 1 + 3*13\n   - 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40.\n\nHmm, interesting. So each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Let's continue this process step by step until I reach the outermost parentheses.\n\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 3)\n   - Step 3 was 40, so 1 + 3*40\n   - 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121.\n\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 4)\n   - Step 4 was 121, so 1 + 3*121\n   - 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364.\n\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 5)\n   - Step 5 was 364, so 1 + 3*364\n   - 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 6)\n   - Step 6 was 1093, so 1 + 3*1093\n   - 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 7)\n   - Step 7 was 3280, so 1 + 3*3280\n   - 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*(result from step 8)\n   - Step 8 was 9841, so 1 + 3*9841\n   - 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost expression: 3*(result from step 9)\n    - Step 9 was 29524, so 3*29524\n    - Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me break it down.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each step builds on the previous one, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each time, we're calculating 1 + 3*(previous result), and finally, we multiply the last result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nLet me recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Start with 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88572\n\nThat looks correct. Each step was calculated correctly, and the final multiplication gives us 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of parentheses. The original problem is:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count how many times the pattern repeats. Starting from the innermost:\n\nEach \"1+3\" is a separate term, and each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(the previous term). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost.\n\nWait, in the original problem, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count how many times \"1 + 3(...)\" appears.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first opening parenthesis after 3, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nAfter the initial 3, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first layer after 3, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n10. (1 + 3\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. Wait, no, let's see. Let me count each \"1 + 3(\" as a new layer.\n\nStarting after the first 3, the first layer is (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), etc.\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. ... inside that: 1 + 3(\n3. ... inside that: 1 + 3(\n4. ... inside that: 1 + 3(\n5. ... inside that: 1 + 3(\n6. ... inside that: 1 + 3(\n7. ... inside that: 1 + 3(\n8. ... inside that: 1 + 3(\n9. ... inside that: 1 + 3(\n10. ... inside that: 1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, no, actually, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\n1. First layer: 1 + 3(\n2. Second layer: 1 + 3(\n3. Third layer: 1 + 3(\n4. Fourth layer: 1 + 3(\n5. Fifth layer: 1 + 3(\n6. Sixth layer: 1 + 3(\n7. Seventh layer: 1 + 3(\n8. Eighth layer: 1 + 3(\n9. Ninth layer: 1 + 3(\n\nWait, but in the expression, after the initial 3, the first \"1 + 3(\" is the first layer, and each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"1 + 3(\", each subsequent one is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, actually, in the expression, after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses before the innermost 1 + 3. Let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the initial 3, the first layer is (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections.\n\nStarting from the first one after 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3)), so the number of layers is actually 9. Because each time, we have a new \"1 + 3(\", and the innermost is the 9th one.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's count the number of closing parentheses at the end. The expression ends with ))))))))). So, that's 9 closing parentheses after the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, each closing parenthesis corresponds to an opening one. Therefore, there are 9 layers. So, the innermost is the 9th layer, and each layer above that is one more step.\n\nWait, but when I did my calculation earlier, I had 10 steps, starting from 1 + 3 as step 1, up to the outermost multiplication by 3 as step 10. But if there are 9 layers, maybe I have 9 steps inside and then the final multiplication.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to layer 9: 1 + 3*(layer8) = ?\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 9 steps inside, starting from the innermost, and then the final step was multiplying by 3. So, maybe the total number of layers is 9, meaning that the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, and then the final multiplication is outside of that.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the count. Let me try to recount.\n\nIf there are 9 layers, each \"1 + 3(...)\", then starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me verify each step again:\n\n1. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the multiplication and addition are done correctly.\n\nI think I might also try to see if there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me define it:\n\nLet a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (3^{6} - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (3^{7} - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (3^{8} - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked my work. Each step was computed correctly, and the formula confirms the result.

    "text": " \n\nSo, to start, I should probably begin by evaluating the innermost part of the expression and then work my way out. Let's count how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1+3(...)\", that's a new layer. Let me count them: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times this happens. \n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is 1+3, then the next one is 1+3(1+3), then the next is 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me see: the innermost is 1+3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. \n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. Let me check again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. \n\nStarting from the right, each opening parenthesis is another layer. Let's see: after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)), then another, and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. \n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1+3(...)). Then inside that, another 3 is multiplied by (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count how many times this happens. \n\nEach time, the structure is 3(1+3(...)), so each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied by something. \n\n1. The outermost 3*(...)\n2. Then inside, another 3*(...)\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to work from the inside out. Let me define each layer step by step. Let me denote each inner expression as a variable. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me define a1, a2, a3, ..., a9, where each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1 = 1+3.\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost expression is 1+3, then the next one is 1+3*(1+3), then the next is 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. So, each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, perhaps I can compute each term step by step.\n\nLet me start by computing the innermost expression first.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but let me check how many layers there are. Each time I compute a new layer, I'm moving one step outward. Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers, starting from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, compute 3*29524:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Because if I have 9 layers, starting from 4 up to 29,524, then 3*29,524 is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\n2. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\n3. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\n4. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\n5. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\n6. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\n7. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000 *3=27,000\n\n500 *3=1,500\n\n20 *3=60\n\n4 *3=12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, it's 1+3(...). So, let's see how many times 1+3 is nested.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen, moving left, each time it's 1+3( ... ), so each layer adds another 1+3(...).\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, each layer corresponds to one step in my earlier calculation, leading to Layer 9 being 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I have 9 layers. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let me count the number of \"1+3(\" segments.\n\nStarting from the first 1+3 after the initial 3(, that's the first \"1+3(\".\n\nThen inside that, another \"1+3(\", and so on.\n\nLet me count each occurrence:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n\n2. inside that: 1+3(\n\n3. inside that: 1+3(\n\n4. inside that: 1+3(\n\n5. inside that: 1+3(\n\n6. inside that: 1+3(\n\n7. inside that: 1+3(\n\n8. inside that: 1+3(\n\n9. inside that: 1+3(\n\nWait, but the innermost is just 1+3), so perhaps I miscounted. Let me see: the expression is 3(1+3(...)), where ... has 8 more \"1+3(\" terms. Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of closing parentheses. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer.\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the end:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the closing parentheses:\n\nEach time I see a ), that's one closing parenthesis.\n\nStarting from the end:\n\nThe innermost part is 1+3), so that's one ).\n\nThen, each layer adds another ), so let's count them:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of closing parentheses is 9, because each \"1+3(...)\" adds a closing parenthesis. Wait, actually, each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one. So, starting from the first 3(, there are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since I already calculated 9 layers and got 29,524 as the innermost value before the final multiplication by 3, and then 3*29,524=88,572, which seems correct, I think that's the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can approach this problem by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nEach term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost term, each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation, and it's a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from the innermost term, 1+3=4). \n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but wait: in our case, a_1 is the innermost term, which is 4. So, when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nPlugging into the general solution:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nSo, using both methods\u2014iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014I arrive at the same result.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me think about that.\n\nEach term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be expanded as a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this expansion, we can express a_n as a sum of powers of 3 plus 3^n*a_0, but since a_1=4, perhaps it's better to use the formula we derived earlier.\n\nBut since we've already confirmed the result using two methods, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding from the innermost layer outward, each layer's value can be computed step by step. Using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4, we find that a_9 = 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. Let me try to parse this step by step. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, actually, when I look at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, there's another 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and so on, until there are nine sets of parentheses. So, that means there are nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, no, actually, each time it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer out is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So, L1 = 1 + 3.

Wait, actually, looking back at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe L1 is the innermost (1 + 3), then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, etc., and the outermost expression is 3*L9. Hmm, let me confirm.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let me start by computing the innermost parentheses first.\n\nLet me start by computing each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 3*40 is indeed 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Okay, moving on.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524.

Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. So, 3*29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72.

As I calculated earlier, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me compute 29524*3 another way to confirm. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, perhaps using a different approach. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, given that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let me think about this. Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved mathematically. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, for such a linear recurrence, the solution can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe standard approach is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution. The homogeneous recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following the pattern L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 59048/2=29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nSo, either way, I arrive at the same answer, which is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct solution. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different methods (iterative step-by-step and using the recurrence relation formula) both lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By solving each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula for such a recurrence, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer**: Start with the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3. **Compute Subsequent Layers**: Each subsequent layer is calculated by plugging the result of the previous layer into the formula 1 + 3*(previous result).\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

That means I need to start solving from the innermost one and work my way outwards. Let me label each layer from 1 to 9 to keep track of where I am.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses, which is the ninth layer: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out to layer 8: It's 1 + 3 times the result of layer 9. So, substituting the value from layer 9, it becomes 1 + 3*4.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, layer 7: 1 + 3*(result from layer 8). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nMoving on to layer 6: 1 + 3*(result from layer 7). That's 1 + 3*40.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(result from layer 6). So, 1 + 3*121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(result from layer 5). That is 1 + 3*364.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(result from layer 4). So, 1 + 3*1093.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(result from layer 3). That is 1 + 3*3280.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nFinally, layer 1: 3*(result from layer 2). So, 3*9841.\n\nLayer 1: 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with large numbers.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Right.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 1: 3*9841. Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Correct.\n\nSo, all the layers check out, and the final result is 29523. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's a smarter way to do this without computing each layer step by step. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and this repeats multiple times, perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me consider what each layer represents. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nBut in our case, the innermost is a_9, and the outermost is a_1. Wait, actually, in our problem, the innermost is layer 9, which is a_1 if we start counting from the inside. Maybe I should adjust my notation.\n\nAlternatively, let's think recursively. Let me define f(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with the base case f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If n is the number of layers, then each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4.\n\nBut in our problem, the entire expression is 3*(f(9)), because the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So, the total expression is 3*f(9), where f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), and f(1) = 4.\n\nSo, f(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait a minute, but earlier when I computed layer by layer, I ended up with f(9) as 9841, but here, according to this recursive formula, f(9) is 29524. That doesn't match. I must have confused the layers.\n\nWait, in my initial computation, I had layer 9 as (1 + 3) = 4, then layer 8 as 1 + 3*4 =13, and so on, up to layer 1 as 3*9841=29523. So, in that case, the outermost layer is 3*(f(9)), where f(9) is the result after 9 layers. But in the recursive function I just defined, f(n) is 1 + 3*f(n-1), starting from f(1)=4.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in how I'm indexing the layers. Let me clarify. If I consider f(n) as the value after n layers, starting from the innermost, then f(1)=4, f(2)=13, f(3)=40, etc., up to f(9)=29524. But in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(f(9)). So, the total expression would be 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. But that's not matching with my initial calculation.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because in my initial calculation, I had 3*(9841)=29523, which is less than 88572. So, I must have misapplied the recursive function.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, each of those is a layer. So, layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), layer 2 is the next one out, and so on up to layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, in that case, f(n) is defined as 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4, and the total expression is 3*f(9).\n\nBut when I computed it step by step, I had layer 9 as 4, layer 8 as 13, layer 7 as 40, layer 6 as 121, layer 5 as 364, layer 4 as 1093, layer 3 as 3280, layer 2 as 9841, and layer 1 as 3*9841=29523.\n\nWait, so in this case, layer 1 is the outermost, which is 3*(layer 2). So, if I define f(n) as the value starting from the innermost, then f(1)=4, f(2)=13, f(3)=40, etc., up to f(9)=9841. Then, the outermost expression is 3*f(9)=3*9841=29523, which matches my initial calculation.\n\nSo, in this case, the function f(n) is defined as f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4, and n=9, and the total expression is 3*f(9). Therefore, the total is 3*9841=29523.\n\nAlternatively, if I define f(n) as starting from the outermost, but that complicates things. So, perhaps the confusion arises from how I index the layers. To avoid confusion, let me redefine:\n\nLet me define f(n) as the value of the expression with n layers, where each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's f(1)=4.\n\nThen, f(2)=1 + 3*f(1)=1 + 12=13\n\nf(3)=1 + 3*f(2)=1 + 39=40\n\nf(4)=1 + 3*f(3)=1 + 120=121\n\nf(5)=1 + 3*f(4)=1 + 363=364\n\nf(6)=1 + 3*f(5)=1 + 1092=1093\n\nf(7)=1 + 3*f(6)=1 + 3279=3280\n\nf(8)=1 + 3*f(7)=1 + 9840=9841\n\nf(9)=1 + 3*f(8)=1 + 29523=29524\n\nBut wait, in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(f(9)). So, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. But that contradicts my initial calculation where I ended up with 29523.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try to map this correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1: 4\n\nThen, moving out, layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(layer 9)=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I considered the outermost layer as layer 1, which was 3*(layer 2)=3*9841=29523. But according to this, the outermost layer is 3*(layer 9)=88572.\n\nSo, where is the confusion?\n\nLet me count the number of layers again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is a new layer. Let's count the number of \"1+\" expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 layer 1\n\nThen, moving out: 1 + 3*(layer 1) \u2192 layer 2\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(layer 2) \u2192 layer 3\n\nContinuing this way, each time adding a new layer until the outermost one, which is 1 + 3*(layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(layer 8)).\n\nWait, so in this case, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3)=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*(layer 9)=3*29524=88572\n\nBut wait, in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"(\" after the initial 3 corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nAfter the initial 3, the first \"(\" starts layer 1: (1+3(...))\n\nThen, each subsequent \"(\" adds a new layer. Let's see:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first \"(\", that's layer 1: (1+3(...))\n\nThen, inside that, another \"(\", layer 2: (1+3(...))\n\nContinuing, layer 3, layer 4, up to layer 9. So, there are 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, the innermost is layer 9: (1 + 3)=4\n\nThen, layer 8: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(layer 1)=3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step calculation, I considered the outermost layer as layer 1, which was 3*(layer 2)=3*9841=29523. But according to this, the outermost layer is 3*(layer 1)=88572.\n\nI think the confusion is in how I labeled the layers. Initially, I labeled the innermost as layer 9, and the outermost as layer 1. But in the recursive function, it's better to label the innermost as layer 1, and build up to layer 9, with the total expression being 3*layer9.\n\nTherefore, in the initial calculation, I was actually computing layer9 as 29524, and then the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I thought the outermost layer was 3*(layer2)=29523, which is incorrect. So, the correct approach is to label the innermost as layer1, compute up to layer9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nSo, let's redo the calculation correctly.\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572, not 29523.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had the outermost layer as 3*(layer2)=29523, which was incorrect because I mislabeled the layers. So, to avoid confusion, I need to correctly label the innermost as layer1, compute up to layer9, and then multiply by 3.\n\nBut let me verify this with a smaller example to see if the recursive approach works. Let's take a smaller version of the problem, say with only two layers.\n\nCompute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nAccording to the recursive method:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nTotal expression: 3*Layer2 = 3*13 = 39\n\nAlternatively, computing directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother example with three layers:\n\nCompute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nTotal expression: 3*40=120\n\nCompute directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the recursive method works for smaller cases. Therefore, applying it to the original problem with nine layers should give the correct result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 29523, which was incorrect because I mislabeled the layers. So, I need to correct that.\n\nTherefore, the correct computation is:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nLayer4:121\n\nLayer5:364\n\nLayer6:1093\n\nLayer7:3280\n\nLayer8:9841\n\nLayer9:29524\n\nTotal expression: 3*29524=88572\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check this again with another smaller example to be sure.\n\nCompute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nLayers:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nLayer3:40\n\nTotal: 3*40=120\n\nDirect computation:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39)=3*40=120. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n\nLayers:\n\nLayer1:4\n\nLayer2:13\n\nTotal:3*13=39\n\nDirect computation:3(1 + 3*4)=3*13=39. Correct.\n\nSo, the recursive approach works. Therefore, for nine layers, the result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me compute it again step by step to be absolutely sure.\n\nStarting from Layer1: (1 + 3)=4\n\nLayer2:1 + 3*4=1 +12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nTotal expression:3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each layer follows the recurrence relation f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), which is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nGiven f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find D, set f(n) = D, then D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2\n\nBut since our f(n) is integer-valued, perhaps this approach isn't the most straightforward, but let's see.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n\n\nThe particular solution is f_p(n) = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n -1/2\n\nApplying the initial condition f(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C =4.5 => C=1.5=3/2\n\nTherefore, f(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, f(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9 layers:\n\nf(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nThus, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572\n\nTherefore, using the closed-form formula, we also get 88572, which confirms the result.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nI think earlier I made a mistake in how I labeled the layers, which led me to the incorrect answer of 29523. By correctly labeling the innermost layer as layer1 and building up to layer9, and then multiplying by 3, I arrive at the correct result of 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times another similar expression. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute each layer step by step. \n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:  \n   Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:  \n   Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)  \n   Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)  \n   Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)  \n   Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)  \n   Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)  \n   Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)  \n   Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)  \n   Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:  \n   Total expression: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

That means I need to evaluate the innermost one first and then work my way outwards. Let me count the number of parentheses to be sure. Starting from the left, each time I see a (1 + 3(...)), that's a new level. Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Yep, nine layers deep. So I'll need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me label each layer from 1 to 9 for clarity. The innermost one is layer 9, and the outermost is layer 1. So I'll start with layer 9 and work my way back to layer 1.\n\n**Layer 9:**\nThe innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n1 + 3 = 4\n\n**Layer 8:**\nNow, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from Layer 9)). Since Layer 9 gave us 4, this becomes:\n1 + 3*4\nFirst, compute 3*4 = 12\nThen, 1 + 12 = 13\n\n**Layer 7:**\nNext, Layer 7 is (1 + 3*(result from Layer 8)). Layer 8 was 13, so:\n1 + 3*13\nCompute 3*13 = 39\nThen, 1 + 39 = 40\n\n**Layer 6:**\nLayer 6 is (1 + 3*(result from Layer 7)). Layer 7 was 40, so:\n1 + 3*40\nCompute 3*40 = 120\nThen, 1 + 120 = 121\n\n**Layer 5:**\nLayer 5 is (1 + 3*(result from Layer 6)).

Layer 4 was 1093, so:\n1 + 3*1093\nCompute 3*1093. Let's break it down: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279\nThen, 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n**Layer 2:**\nLayer 2 is (1 + 3*(result from Layer 3)).

Let's see, 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840\nThen, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n**Layer 1:**\nFinally, Layer 1 is the outermost expression: 3*(result from Layer 2). Layer 2 was 9841, so:\n3*9841\nNow, I need to compute this. Let me break it down:\n3*9000 = 27000\n3*800 = 2400\n3*40 = 120\n3*1 = 3\nNow, add them all together:\n27000 + 2400 = 29400\n29400 + 120 = 29520\n29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer's result was used in the next outer layer until we reached the final computation. Therefore, the final result of the entire expression is 29523.\n\nWait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to slip up with so many layers.

    "text": " That usually makes sense with nested expressions because you can't really evaluate the outer parts until you know the value of the inner ones. So, let me start by writing down the expression and then try to simplify it step by step. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))) Hmm, that's nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), each multiplied by 3. So, maybe I should start from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), and work my way outwards. Let me count the number of nested expressions to make sure I don't miss any. Starting from the innermost: 1. (1 + 3) 2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) 3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) ... and so on, up to nine levels. So, I need to compute each layer step by step. Let's start with the innermost parentheses. Let me write each step down as I go. Step 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). So, that's (1 + 3*4). Let's compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). So, that's (1 + 3*13). Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that level simplifies to 40. Continuing this process, the next level is (1 + 3*(result from step 3)), which is (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that's 121. Next level: (1 + 3*(result from step 4)) = (1 + 3*121). 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, that's 364. Moving out another level: (1 + 3*364). Let's compute that. 3*364 is... Hmm, 364*3. Let me do that step by step. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that level is 1093. Next level: (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that level is 3280. Moving out another level: (1 + 3*3280). Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that level is 9841. Next level: (1 + 3*9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that level is 29524. Now, moving out another level: (1 + 3*29524). Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 24*3 is 72. So, adding those: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that level is 88573. Finally, moving out to the outermost level: (1 + 3*88573). Let's compute 3*88573. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me break it down. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. So, that level simplifies to 265720. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, we have 3 * 265720. Let me compute that. 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3 * 265720 is 797160. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 797,160. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an error when dealing with such large numbers. Let me verify each step quickly. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n11. (1 + 3*88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720 \u2714\ufe0f\n12. 3 * 265720 = 797160 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each step seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 797,160. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each step manually. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented by a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet's denote each level as a term in a sequence. Let's say a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082, and so on, up to a\u2089. Then, the entire expression is 3a\u2089. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a\u2099.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using the method for solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The recurrence is a\u2099 - 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 1, which is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous part: a\u2099 - 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a\u2099^h = C * 3^n.\n\nNext, we need a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a\u2099^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a\u2099 = a\u2099^h + a\u2099^p = C * 3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a\u2081 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C * 3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = (3/2) * 3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}) / 2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Wait, that's the same as step 9 earlier, which makes sense because a\u2089 is the ninth term. So, a\u2089 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 * a\u2089, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier result. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nHold on, let me check. I think I confused the number of terms. The original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so n = 9. But in the recurrence, a\u2081 corresponds to the innermost (1 + 3). So, if we have nine levels, then a\u2089 is the outermost one, which is multiplied by 3. So, the total expression is 3 * a\u2089.\n\nBut according to the formula, a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. But earlier, when I computed step by step, I got 797160. There's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made an error in my step-by-step calculation.\n\nWait a minute, let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. ...\nEach additional (1 + 3(...)) adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's one layer. Each time we go out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of times (1 + 3 appears:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to how many? Let's see: Each \"1 +\" is followed by a \"3(...)\", so each layer adds one more. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3( is nine. Each one corresponds to a new layer. So, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first layer, and then each additional (1 + 3(...) adds another layer. So, in total, there are nine layers. Therefore, a\u2089 is the outermost layer, which is (1 + 3*(...)), and then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nBut according to the formula, a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, so 3*a\u2089 = 88572. But in my step-by-step calculation, I ended up with 797160, which is way larger. That suggests that I made a mistake in my step-by-step approach.\n\nWait, let me go back to my step-by-step calculations and see where I went wrong.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 88573 \u2714\ufe0f\n11. (1 + 3*88573) = 265720 \u2714\ufe0f\n12. 3*265720 = 797160 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, hold on. I think I miscounted the number of layers. The original expression has nine layers, but in my step-by-step, I went up to (1 + 3*88573), which would be the tenth layer. So, perhaps I added an extra layer by mistake.\n\nLet me recount the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections in the original problem. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each time we have a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n10. 1 + 3)\n\nWait, actually, there are ten opening parentheses, which would mean ten layers, not nine. So, my initial thought that there are nine layers was incorrect; there are actually ten layers. That explains why in my step-by-step calculation, I ended up with ten layers, which matched the formula when n=10.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then, (1 + 3(...)) which includes the first one\n3. Then, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nEach \"1 +\" is followed by a \"3(...)\", which is a new layer. Let's count the number of times we have \"1 + 3(\":\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nEach time, we have another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3(, there are nine more (1 + 3(...)) expressions. So, in total, there are ten layers, meaning n=10 in the formula. Therefore, a\u2081\u2080 = (3^{11} - 1)/2. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, in my earlier formula, a\u2081 was the innermost, which is (1 + 3), so a\u2081 = 4. Then, a\u2082 = (1 + 3a\u2081), and so on, up to a\u2081\u2080. So, if there are ten layers, then a\u2081\u2080 is the outermost, and the entire expression is 3*a\u2081\u2080.\n\nSo, using the formula, a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a\u2081\u2080 = (3^{11} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, a\u2081\u2080 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146 / 2 = 88573.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2081\u2080 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nWait, but in my step-by-step calculation, I had a\u2081\u2080 = 265720, and then multiplied by 3 to get 797160. But according to the formula, a\u2081\u2080 is 88573, and 3*a\u2081\u2080 is 265719. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's check the formula again. The general solution was a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=1, a\u2081 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2, a\u2082 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, which also matches. For n=3, a\u2083 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, which matches. So, the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=10, a\u2081\u2080 = (3^{11} -1)/2 = (177147 -1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2081\u2080 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nBut in my step-by-step calculation, I ended up with 797160. That suggests that I must have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the number of layers in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, there are ten (1 + 3(...)) sections. Therefore, n=10, which gives a\u2081\u2080=88573, and the entire expression is 3*88573=265719.\n\nBut in my step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. 4\n2. 13\n3. 40\n4. 121\n5. 364\n6. 1093\n7. 3280\n8. 9841\n9. 29524\n10. 88573\n11. 265720\n12. 797160\n\nWait, so in my step-by-step, I went up to 12 steps, but according to the formula, n=10. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1. Then, each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) adds a layer. So, let's see:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n...\nUp to Layer 10: (1 + 3*(Layer 9))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10). So, in my step-by-step, I computed up to Layer 10, which is 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. However, in my initial step-by-step, I continued beyond that, computing Layer 11 and then multiplying by 3, which was incorrect because the original expression only has ten layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is:\n\n3*(Layer 10), where Layer 10 = (1 + 3*Layer 9). So, in my step-by-step, I computed Layer 1 = 4, Layer 2 = 13, ..., Layer 10 = 88573, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer 10 = 265719.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond that, computing Layer 11 = 265720, and then multiplied by 3 to get 797160. That was a mistake because the original expression only has ten layers. Therefore, the correct answer should be 265719.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me parse the original expression carefully.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n11. 3*(result of layer 10)\n\nWait, no, the initial 3 is outside the first (1 + 3(...)). So, the structure is:\n\n3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 = (1 + 3*(Layer 2)), and Layer 2 = (1 + 3*(Layer 3)), etc., down to Layer 9 = (1 + 3).\n\nWait, that's a different way of counting. So, perhaps the layers are counted from the inside out, with Layer 1 being the innermost (1 + 3), Layer 2 being the next one out, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). But that contradicts the earlier formula.\n\nI think the confusion arises from how we index the layers. Let me try to clarify:\n\nIf we denote Layer 1 as the innermost (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(Layer n)). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, ..., Layer 10: 88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10). So, that would be 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nBut in the original expression, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer 1: 4. Then, moving out, each layer is (1 + 3*previous layer). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, ..., Layer 10: 1 + 3*Layer9=88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer10=3*88573=265719.\n\nTherefore, my initial step-by-step calculation was incorrect because I continued beyond Layer 10, which isn't part of the original expression. So, the correct final answer should be 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with the formula. The formula gave me a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=10, a\u2081\u2080=(3^{11}-1)/2=177146/2=88573. Then, 3*a\u2081\u2080=265719.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the original expression to have nine layers, then n=9, a\u2089=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524, and 3*a\u2089=88572. But that conflicts with the step-by-step which correctly identified ten layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is in whether the initial 3*(...) counts as a layer or not. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the original expression, the structure is:\n\n3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 = 1 + 3*(Layer 2), Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3), ..., Layer 9 = 1 + 3*(Layer 10), Layer 10 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, no, that can't be because Layer 10 would have to be (1 + 3*(Layer 11)), but there's no Layer 11. So, actually, Layer 10 is (1 + 3), which is 4.\n\nWait, that would mean:\n\nLayer 10: (1 + 3) =4\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*13=40\n\n...\n\nLayer 1:1 +3*previous= ?\n\nWait, that would mean that the outermost layer is Layer 1, which is 3*(Layer 1). But Layer 1 would be 1 + 3*Layer2, where Layer2=1 +3*Layer3, etc., down to Layer10=4.\n\nSo, in this case, the formula would be a\u2081 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a\u2081=88572.\n\nBut that contradicts the step-by-step where I computed up to Layer10=88573, which would be a\u2081\u2080=(3^{11}-1)/2=88573, and 3*a\u2081\u2080=265719.\n\nI think the confusion comes from how we index the layers. If we consider the innermost (1 + 3) as Layer1, then the outermost layer is Layer10, and the entire expression is 3*Layer10=265719. But if we consider the outermost (1 + 3(...)) as Layer1, then it's a different indexing.\n\nTo resolve this, perhaps it's better to use the formula directly. Since the formula gives a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and in the original expression, the number of layers is ten, because each (1 + 3(...)) is a new layer, starting from (1 + 3) as the first layer, up to the tenth layer, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nTherefore, n=10, a\u2081\u2080=88573, and the entire expression is 3*a\u2081\u2080=265719.\n\nBut wait, let's check the formula again. The formula was derived with a\u2081 being the innermost layer. So, if we have ten layers, a\u2081\u2080 is the outermost, and the expression is 3*a\u2081\u2080=265719.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the initial 3*(...) as Layer1, then the number of layers inside would be nine, leading to a different result. But in the original expression, the structure is 3*(Layer1), where Layer1 has nine more layers inside. So, perhaps the correct way is to consider Layer1 as the first (1 + 3(...)), and so on, with the innermost being Layer10.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, a\u2081\u2080=88573, and the entire expression is 3*a\u2081\u2080=265719.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I computed Layer1=4, Layer2=13, Layer3=40,..., Layer10=88573, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer10=265719.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the confusion earlier was because I thought the original expression had nine layers, but it actually has ten layers, leading to the result of 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me recount the number of layers in the original expression. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n10. (1 + 3(...))\n\nWait, that's ten layers, each starting with (1 + 3(...)). So, the outermost is Layer10, which is (1 + 3(...)), and then multiplied by 3. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer10). Therefore, using the formula, a\u2081\u2080=88573, and 3*a\u2081\u2080=265719.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 265,719.\n\nBut to make sure, let me compute it step by step correctly, only up to Layer10, and then multiply by 3.\n\nStarting from Layer1:\n\n1. Layer1: (1 + 3) =4\n2. Layer2: (1 + 3*4)=13\n3. Layer3: (1 + 3*13)=40\n4. Layer4: (1 + 3*40)=121\n5. Layer5: (1 + 3*121)=364\n6. Layer6: (1 + 3*364)=1093\n7. Layer7: (1 + 3*1093)=3280\n8. Layer8: (1 + 3*3280)=9841\n9. Layer9: (1 + 3*9841)=29524\n10. Layer10: (1 + 3*29524)=88573\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer10=3*88573=265719.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the formula. So, my initial mistake was continuing one layer too far, which led to an incorrect result. The correct answer is 265,719.\n\nAlternatively, to verify, let's compute the expression from the inside out, step by step, without using the"

    "text": " \n\nSo, let me start by writing down the expression more clearly, maybe in layers, to visualize it better. The innermost part is (1+3), right? Then, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time I go out, it's another layer. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So there are nine layers here. That means I'll have to compute from the 9th layer up to the first. \n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outward, calculating each layer step by step. Let me try that approach. So, starting with the innermost part: \n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4. Now, moving one layer out, that's Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9). So, substituting Layer 9's value, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So Layer 8 is 13.\n\nNow, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Substituting Layer 8's value: 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 7 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). So that's 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 6 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first: 3*120 is 360, and 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364.\n\nNext, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 4 is 1093.\n\nMoving to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So Layer 3 is 3280.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. So Layer 2 is 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So Layer 1 is 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original problem is 3 times that entire expression. So the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down, 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nStarting from Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Hmm, maybe I didn't make a mistake after all. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about this.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nWait, I see a pattern here. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this works for the first few layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute this without going through each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers increases.\n\nBut since in this problem there are only 9 layers, both methods work, but the formula is more scalable.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with 9 layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it, we can find a closed-form expression to compute the value efficiently. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By evaluating from the innermost layer outward, each layer's value is computed step by step. Recognizing the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with an initial condition, we derive a closed-form solution \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this for 9 layers and multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\nStep-by-step evaluation:\n\n1. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That's simple enough. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another set of parentheses where it's 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now that parentheses evaluates to 13. Moving out another level, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, so each time I move out a level, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying it by 3, and then adding 1. Let me keep track of this step by step because it's easy to get lost in the nesting.\n\nLet me list each step as I go from the innermost parentheses outward. Maybe numbering them will help.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next level: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next level: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next level: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next level: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next level: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next level: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next level: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next level: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next level: (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, so after each step, we're getting a larger number. Let me make sure I'm counting the levels correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So I think there are nine levels here. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost level: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait a minute, hold on. I think I might have made a mistake here. The original expression is 3 times the entire nested part. So after computing the innermost nine levels, the result is 29524, and then we multiply that by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nWait, let me recount. Let me check how many levels there are. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a level. Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is a new level, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost multiplication by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, so I think I miscounted earlier. There are nine levels of nesting, each time evaluating to a new value, and then the outermost 3 multiplies that result. So the final answer would be 88572.\n\nBut let me double-check each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake here.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n10. Finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So:\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I should try a different approach or see if there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Because this seems like a recursive expression where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nLet me consider that each step is defined by a recurrence relation. Let's denote each level as a_n, where n is the level number starting from the innermost. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, since there are nine levels of nesting.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my initial step-by-step computation, let me verify each a_n:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, all these match the closed-form formula:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nFor n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the step-by-step computations are consistent with the closed-form solution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The nested expression evaluates to 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead to the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each level of nesting as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the level number starting from the innermost.

    "text": " That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, I see that the innermost part is (1+3). Let me write that down: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, so that's the innermost part. Now, moving one layer out, I have another (1 + 3(...)). But before I jump into that, let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. Each time, the expression is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. So, let's count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time I solve a layer, I move out one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first closing parenthesis. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first (1+3) is the innermost, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3\" before the first closing parenthesis. Hmm, let me try to parse it:\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers. Each time we have a 3 multiplied by another expression, so the number of layers is the number of times we can nest these expressions.\n\nLooking at the original expression, I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses before the first closing parenthesis. Let me check: Each time, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and there are nine such layers. Wait, actually, no. Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first closing parenthesis. Let me write down the expression as a string to see:\n\n\"3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\"\n\nSo, starting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first ( is after 3, then each subsequent ( is part of each layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count how many times the expression 1+3(...) appears. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3*(result from step 1))\n3. Then, moving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*(result from step 2))\n4. And so on, until we've done this nine times.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each time, the inner expression is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 to 9. So, layer 1 is the innermost, layer 9 is the outermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12, then (1 + Layer 2) = 1 + 12 = 13\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. Each layer is (1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, the next layer out is (1 + 3*(4)) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*(13)) = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on.\n\nWait, that seems better. So, each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me list the layers from innermost to outermost as layers 1 through 9, and compute each one.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer9). So, after computing Layer9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let me calculate 29524*3.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 *3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, 29524 *3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again.\n\nLayer1: (1 +3) =4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer2: (1 +3*4)=1+12=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer3: (1 +3*13)=1+39=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer4: (1 +3*40)=1+120=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer5: (1 +3*121)=1+363=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer6: (1 +3*364)=1+1092=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer7: (1 +3*1093)=1+3279=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer8: (1 +3*3280)=1+9840=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer9: (1 +3*9841)=1+29523=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) expressions. Each time, it's 1+3*(...), so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's one layer. Then each subsequent (1+3*(...)) adds another layer. So, let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first closing parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 1\n2. (1+3(1+3)) \u2192 2\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u21923\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) \u21924\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u21925\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u21926\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u21927\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) \u21928\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))) \u21929\n\nSo, yes, there are nine layers. So, my earlier calculation is correct, with Layer9 being 29524, and the total expression being 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute 29524*3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u2192 write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again each layer's computation to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 +3\u00d74=1+12=13 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 +3\u00d713=1+39=40 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 +3\u00d740=1+120=121 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 +3\u00d7121=1+363=364 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 +3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 +3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer8: 1 +3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841 \u2192 correct.\n\nLayer9: 1 +3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo, all layers are correct, and the final result is 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where ... is the nested part. So, I think I accounted for that correctly by computing Layer9 as 29524 and then multiplying by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions. The general form is something like a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) etc. So, in this case, a=1 and b=3. The nested expression can be represented as a function f(n) where n is the number of layers.\n\nIn this problem, n=9, since there are nine layers. So, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=1+3=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation, and it can be solved to find f(n). The solution to this recurrence is f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1, f(1)=4. Using the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, f(2)=1+3*4=13. Using the formula: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: f(3)=1+3*13=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, f(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the nested expression. That confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. After computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula for the nested expression, the result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me start computing from there and work my way outwards. Maybe if I compute each layer one by one, it'll become clearer.\n\nLet me assign each layer a number from the inside out, so Layer 1 is the innermost one, and Layer 9 is the outermost. That way, I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. So, the innermost part is 4. Now, moving out one layer.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times that entire expression. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let me compute that.\n\nTotal expression = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\nSo, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Okay, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the total expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the structure of the problem. The original expression is 3*(...). So, after computing the innermost parentheses, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result), and so on, until Layer 9, which is the innermost part of the entire expression, right?\n\nWait, but in the original problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the problem again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the first ( after 3, each time it's 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another 1+3(...\n3. Continuing until the last one, which is 1+3(...))))).\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. (1+3*(Layer1)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. (1+3*(Layer2)) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. (1+3*(Layer3)) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. (1+3*(Layer4)) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. (1+3*(Layer5)) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. (1+3*(Layer6)) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. (1+3*(Layer7)) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. (1+3*(Layer8)) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the total expression is 3*(Layer9). So, Layer9 is 29524, and 3*29524 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when you have multiple layers, especially with multiplication, it's easy to make an off-by-one error or miscount the layers. Let me make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the original problem: each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time you go one layer out. So, let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. (1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u2192 Layer 6\n7.

(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nWait, actually, I think I might have miscounted earlier. Let me recount. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there?\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. (1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nSo, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, my initial calculation was correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the total expression. The entire expression is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again, step by step, to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's do this step by step.\n\nCompute 9841 * 3:\n\n- 9000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 800 * 3 = 2,400\n- 40 * 3 = 120\n- 1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523.\n\nSo, 3*9841 = 29,523.\n\nThen, Layer9: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n----------\n(4\u00d73)=12, write down 2, carry over 1\n(2\u00d73)=6 +1=7, write down 7\n(5\u00d73)=15, write down 5, carry over 1\n(9\u00d73)=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2\n(2\u00d73)=6 +2=8, write down 8\nSo, 88,572.\n\nPerfect, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nGiven the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous part: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but using the formula, since Layer9 is a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11}-3)/2=(177147-3)/2=177144/2=88,572. That's consistent with our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute the total expression as (3^{11}-3)/2=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked everything, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous result), and after computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula, we find that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward to Layer 9, compute each layer's value.\n\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Outermost Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n\n   - Total Expression: 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n4. **Verification Using Formula:**\n   The recurrence relation for each layer can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result as (3^{11} - 3)/2 = 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let me try that approach. Let me rewrite the expression for clarity:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. \n\nSo, innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. \n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. \n\nWait, so that middle part is 13. Let me check that again: yes, 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. \n\nNow, moving another level out, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. \n\nWait, so now it's 40. Let me write down each step as I go to keep track.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next level: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next level: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next level: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next level: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next level: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next level: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost expression: 3*29524\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm counting the levels correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: each opening parenthesis before the 1+3... So, starting from the innermost, which is the last one, and moving outward, there are nine levels. So, each step I took above corresponds to each level. Let me list them again to confirm:\n\n1. Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after each innermost, it's 1 + 3*(...), so the outermost expression is 3*(Level 9 result). So, the outermost is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. \n\n29524 * 3:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again because I might have made a mistake in the levels. Let me recount the number of levels. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a level. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nSo, there are nine opening parentheses, each adding a level. So, the innermost is level 9, and each step out is a higher level. So, my earlier calculation of 9 levels seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I computed Level 9 as 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, that's correct because 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, but just to make sure, perhaps I should compute each level again step by step.\n\nLet me list each level with its computation:\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the innermost is 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing a level. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each step out is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, yes, 9 levels in total, leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but perhaps I miscounted the number of levels. Let me try to visualize the structure.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each level adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, each time, it's a new level. So, how many times does 1 + 3*(... occur? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new level. So, the expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after the initial 3: there are 9 of them. So, that means 9 levels. So, yes, 9 levels, each time 1 + 3*(previous level). So, my earlier computation is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the computation again because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Level 7 again because 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279=3280. That's correct.\n\nLevel 8: 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, so 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that again:\n\n9841*3:\n\n- 9000*3=27000\n\n- 800*3=2400\n\n- 40*3=120\n\n- 1*3=3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 3*9841=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000*3=60000\n\n- 9000*3=27000\n\n- 500*3=1500\n\n- 20*3=60\n\n- 4*3=12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this problem might be to recognize a pattern or formula, perhaps using geometric series or something similar. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the structure, each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had a_1 = (1 + 3) = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, and so on up to a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which would allow me to compute a_9 without computing each step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSo, substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nWait, that gives a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nHmm, that seems odd, but let's go with it.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check that for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as computed before.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once more by computing each step using the formula.\n\nSince a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used the formula from the start without computing each level, which might have been faster, but since the problem only has nine levels, computing each step wasn't too bad.\n\nIn summary, the problem involves computing a nested expression with nine levels, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). By either iteratively computing each level or finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, the result is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked all my steps, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each level step by step:\n\n1. Innermost parentheses: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
