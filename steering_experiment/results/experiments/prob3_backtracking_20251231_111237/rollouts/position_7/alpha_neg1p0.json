    "text": " That makes sense because, in order of operations, I should handle what's inside the innermost parentheses first before moving outward.\n\nSo, let me start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down. That would be the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). I can compute that easily. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one step out, the next expression would be 1 plus 3 times that result. So, the next level is (1 + 3*(innermost result)). Since the innermost result is 4, that becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. So, that simplifies to 13. \n\nAlright, so now I've simplified two layers, starting from the inside. Let me write down each step as I go. So, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNow, moving one more layer out. The next expression would be 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, that's (1 + 3*13). Let me calculate that. 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 plus 39 is 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this process, each time I take the previous result, multiply it by 3, add 1, and that becomes the new result. Let me tabulate each step to keep track:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check the count of layers. The original expression has multiple layers, each starting with a 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time after the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)). Let me count how many times that happens.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, that's the second layer. Then inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on. Let me count each layer:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) - first layer\n2. Inside that, 1 + 3*(...) - second layer\n3. Then another 1 + 3*(...) - third layer\n4. Continuing this way, each time I have another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, maybe I should count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me look again:\n\nThe original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each time after that, \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances.\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then inside, another 1+3(...\n3. Continuing until the last one, which is 1+3(1+3). So, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur? Let me count each opening parenthesis after the initial 3.\n\nEach time after the first 3, there's a \"1+3(\", so let's see:\n\n- The first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3: that's one.\n- Then inside that, another \"1+3(\": two.\n- Continuing until the innermost one, which is the ninth \"1+3(\" because after the initial 3, there are eight more \"1+3(\" before the innermost (1+3). Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers by counting the number of closing parentheses. The entire expression ends with a series of closing parentheses. Let me count how many closing parentheses there are after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the end: ...))) with nine closing parentheses. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to an opening one, so there are nine sets of parentheses inside the main expression. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more step outward.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times I can see \"1+3(\" before the innermost (1+3). Let me see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then 1+3(...\n3. Then 1+3(...\n4. Then 1+3(...\n5. Then 1+3(...\n6. Then 1+3(...\n7. Then 1+3(...\n8. Then 1+3(1+3))\n\nSo, from the initial 3, there are 8 more \"1+3(\" before the innermost (1+3). So, that would make a total of 9 layers, right? Because the innermost is the first, and then each layer adds another. So, let me confirm that.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial 3 is outside all the layers. Then each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each time we go out, that's another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: )))))))) with nine closing parentheses. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to an opening one, so the number of layers is nine. Therefore, there are nine layers to compute, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, but when I started earlier, I only computed up to the ninth step and got 29524, but I think I might have miscounted. Let me try again, but this time, I'll list each step clearly, making sure I count correctly.\n\nLet me list each step, starting from the innermost (1+3):\n\n1. Step 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Step 2: 1 + 3*(Step1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Step 3: 1 + 3*(Step2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Step 4: 1 + 3*(Step3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Step 5: 1 + 3*(Step4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Step 6: 1 + 3*(Step5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Step 7: 1 + 3*(Step6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Step 8: 1 + 3*(Step7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Step 9: 1 + 3*(Step8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but now I'm getting 29524 at Step 9. Then the outermost layer is 3*(Step9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... is the result after Step9. So, the final computation is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3 times 29524. Let me calculate that:\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000\n\nThen, 3*500 = 1500\n\nThen, 3*24 = 72\n\nWait, but maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading from the top:\n\n29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps. Let me go through each step again, just to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe I had nine layers, but perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" after the first 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let me count how many \"1+3(\" there are after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first \"1+3(\" is right after the first 3. Then, each subsequent \"1+3(\" is inside the previous one.\n\nLet me count how many times \"1+3(\" occurs after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then inside, 1+3(...\n3. Then another 1+3(...\n4. Then another 1+3(...\n5. Then another 1+3(...\n6. Then another 1+3(...\n7. Then another 1+3(...\n8. Then another 1+3(1+3))\n\nSo, from the initial 3, there are 8 instances of \"1+3(\" before the innermost (1+3). Therefore, the innermost (1+3) is the 9th layer. Wait, that can't be. Because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so if there are 8 \"1+3(\" after the initial 3, that would mean 8 layers inside. But when I computed earlier, I had 9 steps, which included the innermost (1+3) as step 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising from how I'm counting the layers. Let me clarify:\n\n- The entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... has 8 layers of \"1+3(...)\".\n\nWait, no, let me see. The initial 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, there's another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" instances after the initial 3.\n\nSo, in the original expression, how many \"1+3(\" are there after the initial 3? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the initial 3, the first \"1+3(\" is after it, then each subsequent \"1+3(\" inside the previous one. So, each time, it's 1+3(, and I can count the number of times that occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time after the initial 3, there's a \"1+3(\" followed by another \"1+3(\", etc., until the innermost (1+3). Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the first 3: 1+3(\n2. Inside that: 1+3(\n3. Inside that: 1+3(\n4. Inside that: 1+3(\n5. Inside that: 1+3(\n6. Inside that: 1+3(\n7. Inside that: 1+3(\n8. Inside that: 1+3(\n9. Then the innermost: 1+3\n\nWait, no, the innermost is 1+3, without a \"1+3(\" after it. So, perhaps the number of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3 is 8, because the innermost is just (1+3), not followed by another \"1+3(\".\n\nTherefore, the number of layers would be 8, each corresponding to a \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by counting 9 layers, when it's actually 8.\n\nWait, let me recount the steps:\n\nIf there are 8 layers after the initial 3, then the innermost is the 8th layer. So, let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n\nThen, the outermost layer would be 3*(9841). Let me compute that: 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that.\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*800 = 2400\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n3*1 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nWait, so 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I thought there were 9 layers, I ended up with 29524, but that must have been incorrect because the number of layers is 8, so the outermost layer is 3*(9841) = 29523.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If there are 8 layers after the initial 3, then the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 8. So, the expression would be 3*(result of layer 8). So, layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 = 29523.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought there were 9 layers, I had 29524 as the result before multiplying by 3, which led to 88572. But if the correct number of layers is 8, then the result is 29523, and then the outermost 3*(29523) = 88569.\n\nWait, that's a different result. So, I'm confused now. Let me try to count the layers again more carefully.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count how many \"1+3(\" are present:\n\n1. After the initial 3: 1+3(\n2. Then another 1+3(\n3. Then another 1+3(\n4. Then another 1+3(\n5. Then another 1+3(\n6. Then another 1+3(\n7. Then another 1+3(\n8. Then another 1+3(\n9. Then the innermost: 1+3\n\nWait, so that's 8 \"1+3(\" after the initial 3, and then the innermost is 1+3. So, that makes 9 layers in total, right? Because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and the innermost is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the innermost is (1+3), which is the 9th layer. So, perhaps my initial count was correct with 9 layers, leading to the result of 29524 before the outermost 3*.\n\nWait, but when I counted the number of closing parentheses, there were nine of them, which would correspond to nine layers. So, that would mean that the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write out each layer step by step, making sure I count correctly.\n\nLet me list each layer, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the original expression has nine layers of \"1+3(...)\", each nested inside the previous one, starting from the innermost (1+3) as Layer1 up to Layer9, and then the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer9.\n\nTherefore, the correct final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach to be sure. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation of the first order. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1.\n\nThen, the next layer is a_2 = 13, which would be (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer before the initial 3 is a_9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we arrive at the same result, 88572.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " That makes sense because with nested parentheses, you always work from the inside out.\n\nAlright, so let me try to parse this expression. The outermost part is 3 multiplied by (1 + something). That something is 3 multiplied by another (1 + something else), and this pattern continues all the way down to the innermost part, which is just 1 + 3. So, maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, I can compute each part step by step without getting confused.\n\nLet me write down the expression more clearly so I can visualize it better. The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? So, let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer gives me 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, okay, so that layer is 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Let me calculate that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nNext, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121 first. 3 times 120 is 360, and 3 more is 363. Then, adding 1 gives us 364. So, that layer is 364.\n\nGoing out another layer, it's 1 + 3*364. Let's do 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives us 1093. So, this layer is 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives us 3280. So, that layer is 3280.\n\nNext, another layer out: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives us 9841. So, that layer is 9841.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, this layer is 29524.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*29524. Let's calculate 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives us 88573. So, that layer is 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by this result, which is 3*88573. Let me compute that. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, the final result is 265719.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. It's easy to slip up with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nFinally, 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nHmm, seems consistent each time. So, I think 265719 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation. Specifically, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n}*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4. So, maybe I need to adjust the indices.\n\nLet me think. If we have a recurrence starting at n=1, with a_1 = 4, then for n \u2265 2, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, using the formula, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n}*(a_1 - d/(c - 1)) + d/(c - 1). Plugging in c=3, d=1, a_1=4:\n\na_n = 3^{n}*(4 - (1)/(3 - 1)) + (1)/(3 - 1)\n= 3^{n}*(4 - 1/2) + 1/2\n= 3^{n}*(7/2) + 1/2\n= (7*3^{n} + 1)/2\n\nSo, for each n, a_n = (7*3^{n} + 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that with n=1:\n\na_1 = (7*3 + 1)/2 = (21 + 1)/2 = 22/2 = 11. But wait, earlier I calculated a_1 as 4. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, maybe my indexing is off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} + 1)/2. Let me test that.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} + 1)/2 = (9 + 1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. Hmm, no, that's not 4.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Let's try to derive it properly.\n\nGiven the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can write this as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works.\n\nNow, how many layers do we have in the original problem? Let's count.\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until we reach the outermost 3(...).\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is 3 multiplied by a term that has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears inside.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1+3 followed by another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is a_9, where a_n is defined as above.\n\nWait, but in our earlier formula, a_n corresponds to n layers starting from a_1. So, if the innermost is a_1, then the outermost is a_9.\n\nThus, the value inside the outermost 3 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, 3^{10} = 59049.\n\nThen, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, that's the same as I computed earlier when I did it step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but earlier I had 265719 as the final result. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the formula, a_n is the value at each layer, starting from a_1=4, up to a_9=29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut when I computed step by step earlier, I went all the way up to 88573 and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. Wait, that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. When I computed step by step, I had:\n\nStarting from innermost:\n\na1 = 4\n\na2 =13\n\na3=40\n\na4=121\n\na5=364\n\na6=1093\n\na7=3280\n\na8=9841\n\na9=29524\n\nThen, the outermost is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step computation, I ended up with 265719. That must have been a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nWait, in my initial computation, I had:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3=4\n\n2. 1+3*4=13\n\n3. 1+3*13=40\n\n4. 1+3*40=121\n\n5. 1+3*121=364\n\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n\n10. Then, the outermost is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial thought process, I went one step further, computing 1+3*29524=88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. That was incorrect because the outermost expression is only 3 times the inner expression, not 1 + 3 times it.\n\nSo, in my initial step-by-step, I mistakenly added 1 and multiplied by 3 one extra time, leading to an incorrect result. So, the correct result should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, according to the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*a_9=88572. So, that's correct.\n\nBut in my initial computation, I had 10 layers, but actually, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, so the outermost is 3*a_9, not a_10.\n\nWait, so in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to a_9=29524, and then the outermost is 3*a_9=88572. So, why did I think it was 265719 earlier? Because I mistakenly thought that the outermost was another layer, but actually, the outermost is just 3 times the last computed a_n.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my first step-by-step computation, I had:\n\n1. 4\n\n2.13\n\n3.40\n\n4.121\n\n5.364\n\n6.1093\n\n7.3280\n\n8.9841\n\n9.29524\n\n10. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's correct. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial computation, I thought that the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so I computed the innermost up to 29524, then 3*29524=88572. So, that's correct.\n\nBut earlier, I thought I had 265719, which was wrong because I added 1 and multiplied by 3 one extra time.\n\nSo, to confirm, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let's check with the formula again.\n\nWe have a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in my initial step-by-step, I correctly computed up to a_9=29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, why did I have a conflicting thought earlier where I thought the answer was 265719? Because I miscounted the layers or misapplied the formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check with another approach. Let me compute the entire expression step by step again, just to be sure.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but in my initial thought process, I thought the answer was 265719, which was incorrect. So, I have to be careful.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula: a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. For n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure I counted the layers correctly.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3(...). Therefore, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, so a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers or misapplying the formula, but now I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added.\n\nBut in any case, both the step-by-step computation and the formula give the same result, so I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing that the expression is a nested set of terms where each term is \\(1 + 3\\) times another similar expression. We can solve this by working from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost part:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2.

Continue this process for each layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n4. The outermost layer is:\n   \\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each one starts with a 1 and adds 3 multiplied by another similar expression. So, starting from the innermost one, which is (1+3), that's easy enough. Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let's compute that:\n   - 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from above)). So, substituting the result we just got:\n   - 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next level out, it's again (1 + 3*(previous result)):\n   - 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that. If I have (1 + 3*13), that's 1 + 39, which is indeed 40. Okay, moving on.\n\n4. Next expression:\n   - 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Continuing outward:\n   - 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next:\n   - 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Then:\n   - 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next level:\n   - 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Finally, the outermost expression:\n   - 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but hold on, I think I might have miscounted the number of parentheses. Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's one set, then each subsequent layer adds another set. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, each corresponding to a (1 + 3*...). So, starting from the innermost, I have nine layers to compute. But when I did the steps above, I went from (1+3) up to 1 + 3*(9841), which was the ninth step, resulting in 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, right? Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, no, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the whole nested part. So, the nested part is (1 + 3*(...)), which after nine layers gives 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which would be 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the number of layers. Let me recount. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, I have nine layers to compute, each time moving outward. So, the first layer is (1+3) = 4, then the next layer is (1 + 3*4) = 13, then (1 + 3*13) = 40, then (1 + 3*40) = 121, then (1 + 3*121) = 364, then (1 + 3*364) = 1093, then (1 + 3*1093) = 3280, then (1 + 3*3280) = 9841, then (1 + 3*9841) = 29524. So, that's nine layers, right? So, the nested part evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000*3 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\nThen, 500*3 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\nThen, 24*3 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in each step. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when multiplying large numbers.\n\nLet me recast this. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without having to compute each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWe can factor this as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the nested part evaluates to 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 3*(1 + 3*(...)) = 3*a_9, where a_9 = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the nested part evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer**: Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. **Next Layer**: Compute (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n3. **Next Layer**: Compute (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n4. **Next Layer**: Compute (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n5. **Next Layer**: Compute (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n6. **Next Layer**: Compute (1 + 3*364) = 1,093.\n7. **Next Layer**: Compute (1 + 3*1,093) = 3,280.\n8. **Next Layer**: Compute (1 + 3*3,280) = 9,841.\n9. **Next Layer**: Compute (1 + 3*9,841) = 29,524.\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply the result by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last term, which is 1+3. So, maybe I should compute that first and then work my way outward. Let me write that down.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another expression that's multiplied by 3. Let me see. The next layer is 1 + 3*(result of the innermost part). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, it's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so that's 40. I can see a pattern here where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me try to do this systematically, maybe writing down each step so I don't get lost.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which we've already done, let's go step by step.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, after computing the innermost parentheses all the way out, we have the entire nested part equal to 29524, and then we have to multiply that by 3. So, let me do that last step.\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break that down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (20 * 3) + (4 * 3)\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 should be:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but hold on, did I count the layers correctly? Let me check how many layers I computed. I started from the innermost, which was layer 1: 4, then layer 2:13, layer3:40, layer4:121, layer5:364, layer6:1093, layer7:3280, layer8:9841, layer9:29524. So, that's nine layers, which matches the original expression. So, the entire nested part is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the problem, I thought it might be a geometric series or something, but maybe not. Let me just verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire nested expression, which we've computed as 29524. So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the first 3(1+3(...), each subsequent 1+3( adds another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nSo, the number of times \"1+3(\" appears is 9 times. Therefore, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So, when I computed up to 29524, that's correct, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a formula for such expressions? It seems like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39=40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which is 29524.\n\nSo, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A +1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA -3A =1\n\n-2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C -1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC= (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations in my head. Let me verify 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute each layer step by step, as I did earlier, and confirm that each step is correct. Let me do that again quickly:\n\n1. a1=1+3=4\n\n2. a2=1+3*4=13\n\n3. a3=1+3*13=40\n\n4. a4=1+3*40=121\n\n5. a5=1+3*121=364\n\n6. a6=1+3*364=1093\n\n7. a7=1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. a8=1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. a9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

    "text": " That seems like a good approach because working from the inside out is a common strategy with nested parentheses.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 times another expression. Let me try to evaluate the innermost part first and then work my way outward. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: $1 + 3$. That's straightforward. Let me compute that:\n\n$1 + 3 = 4$\n\nSo, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is $1 + 3(4)$. Let me compute that:\n\n$1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13$\n\nAlright, so the next layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is $1 + 3(13)$. Let me calculate that:\n\n$1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40$\n\nHmm, that's 40. Next layer out is $1 + 3(40)$. Let me do that:\n\n$1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121$\n\nOkay, so now we have 121. Moving out another layer, the next expression is $1 + 3(121)$. Let me compute that:\n\n$1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364$\n\nWhoa, that's getting big. Next layer out is $1 + 3(364)$. Let me calculate that:\n\n$1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\nWow, 1093. Moving out another layer, the next expression is $1 + 3(1093)$. Let me find that:\n\n$1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\nAlright, so now we have 3280. Next layer out is $1 + 3(3280)$. Let me compute that:\n\n$1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\nThat's a pretty large number. Now, moving out another layer, the expression is $1 + 3(9841)$. Let me calculate that:\n\n$1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\nWow, 29524. Next layer out is $1 + 3(29524)$. Let me compute that:\n\n$1 + 3(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573$\n\nOkay, so now we have 88573. Finally, the outermost layer is $1 + 3(88573)$. Let me calculate that:\n\n$1 + 3(88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720$\n\nSo, the entire expression inside the very outermost parentheses simplifies to 265720. But wait, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, I need to compute:\n\n$3 \\times 265720$\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$3 \\times 265720 = 797160$\n\nHmm, so the final result is 797160. Let me just verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to get lost in all these numbers, so double-checking is a good idea.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. $1 + 3 = 4$ \u2705\n2. $1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13$ \u2705\n3. $1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40$ \u2705\n4. $1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121$ \u2705\n5. $1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364$ \u2705\n6. $1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093$ \u2705\n7. $1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280$ \u2705\n8. $1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841$ \u2705\n9. $1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524$ \u2705\n10. $1 + 3(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573$ \u2705\n11. $1 + 3(88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720$ \u2705\n12. Finally, $3 \\times 265720 = 797160$ \u2705\n\nEach step seems correct. So, I think the final answer is indeed 797,160. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident about this result. It's interesting how each layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1, leading to such a large number. It makes me think about geometric sequences or something similar, but in this case, it's a finite nested expression.\n\nWait a second, just to make sure, let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each step manually. Maybe recognizing this as a geometric series or something recursive. Let's see.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, say a_n where n is the number of layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about solving this recurrence. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So, for each layer, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, how many layers do we have in the original problem?\n\nLooking back at the original expression, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...), so each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nLooking at the original expression, each time after the first 1+3, there are 8 more layers because the innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Wait, actually, let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a 1 + 3(...), and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3( ... )): 1\n2. Then inside, another 1 + 3( ... ): 2\n3. Continuing, we have 1 + 3( ... ) nine times in total? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me see how many layers there are.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3(Layer 1))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3(Layer 2))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: because starting from the innermost, each time we add another layer, and the outermost expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, total layers from innermost to outermost is 9.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3(1 + 3(...)), so the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so Layer 2 is (1 + 3(Layer1)), Layer3 is (1 + 3(Layer2)), and so on until Layer9. So, the expression inside the outermost 3 is Layer9.\n\nTherefore, the total layers are 9, starting from Layer1 to Layer9. So, using the formula, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, the expression inside the outermost parentheses was 265720, which is Layer9? Wait, no, hold on.\n\nWait, no, because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So, Layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572. But wait, in my step-by-step computation earlier, the expression inside the outermost parentheses was 265720, which is Layer9? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me clarify. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's Layer1: (1 + 3) =4.\n\nThen, Layer2: 1 + 3*Layer1=1 +12=13.\n\nLayer3:1 +3*Layer2=1 +39=40.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nWait, so Layer9 is 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step computation, I went all the way to 265720 before multiplying by 3. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, the innermost is (1+3). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nEach time we have a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then inside, another (1 + 3(...))\n...\nEach time we have a new layer. So, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, we have:\n\n1. 1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), starting from the innermost. So, Layer1 is (1 + 3), Layer2 is 1 + 3*(Layer1), up to Layer9. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, according to the formula, Layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step computation, I ended up with 797160. That suggests that perhaps I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me check.\n\nWait, in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. 1 +3=4\n\n2. 1 +3*4=13\n\n3. 1 +3*13=40\n\n4. 1 +3*40=121\n\n5. 1 +3*121=364\n\n6. 1 +3*364=1093\n\n7. 1 +3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1 +3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1 +3*9841=29524\n\n10. 1 +3*29524=88573\n\n11. 3*88573=265719\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), which is 3*(Layer9). So, Layer9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572, which is different from my initial step-by-step where I ended up with 797160. Clearly, I made a mistake in my initial step-by-step.\n\nWait, no, let me recount the layers in the original expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nEach time, we have a new layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\nFrom the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there?\n\nEach time we have a 1 + 3(...), so let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 Layer1\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. (1 + 3(Layer1)) \u2192 Layer2\n\n3. (1 + 3(Layer2)) \u2192 Layer3\n\n4. (1 + 3(Layer3)) \u2192 Layer4\n\n5. (1 + 3(Layer4)) \u2192 Layer5\n\n6. (1 + 3(Layer5)) \u2192 Layer6\n\n7. (1 + 3(Layer6)) \u2192 Layer7\n\n8. (1 + 3(Layer7)) \u2192 Layer8\n\n9. (1 + 3(Layer8)) \u2192 Layer9\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So, total layers are 9, and the outermost is 3*(Layer9). Therefore, according to the formula, Layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went up to Layer10, which would be (1 +3*Layer9)=88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. But that's incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, I think I made a mistake in my initial step-by-step by going one layer too far.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's Layer1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), up to Layer9.\n\nSo, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is Layer9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had 11 steps, which suggests that I considered 10 layers, which is incorrect. Therefore, my initial step-by-step was wrong because I miscounted the layers.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to recognize that there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...), so Layer9 is (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, and the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut wait, that contradicts my initial step-by-step where I had 11 steps, leading to 797160. So, I must have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize the expression with more parentheses.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the first 3(, then inside it, we have:\n\n1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, the number of layers increases by one. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" inside:\n\n1. The first one after the initial 3( is Layer1.\n\nThen, inside that, another \"1 + 3(\" is Layer2.\n\nContinuing, Layer3, Layer4, Layer5, Layer6, Layer7, Layer8, Layer9.\n\nSo, total layers inside the outermost 3*(...) are 9. Therefore, the expression inside is Layer9, which is (3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had 11 steps, which suggests that I considered 10 layers, which is incorrect. So, my initial step-by-step was wrong because I miscounted the layers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572, not 797160.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had:\n\n1. 1 +3=4\n\n2. 1 +3*4=13\n\n3. 1 +3*13=40\n\n4. 1 +3*40=121\n\n5. 1 +3*121=364\n\n6. 1 +3*364=1093\n\n7. 1 +3*1093=3280\n\n8. 1 +3*3280=9841\n\n9. 1 +3*9841=29524\n\n10. 1 +3*29524=88573\n\n11. 3*88573=265719\n\nBut according to the formula, Layer9 is 29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I continued one layer beyond the actual number of layers in the expression. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572, not 265719.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 9 layers, so Layer9 is 29524, and 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, my initial step-by-step was wrong because I thought the outermost expression was 3*(Layer10), but in reality, it's 3*(Layer9). So, I need to correct that.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute Layer9 using the formula:\n\nLayer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I had 11 steps, which suggests that I considered 10 layers, leading to a different result. Therefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I miscounted the layers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the expression step by step correctly, this time with the correct number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, my initial mistake was continuing one layer too far, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let me compute Layer9 step by step:\n\nLayer1:4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, Layer9 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to Layer10, which was incorrect. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that the original expression has 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the outermost 3*(...):\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3(, each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses inside the outermost 3*(...). Therefore, there are 9 layers, so Layer9 is 29524, and the total is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, in my initial step-by-step, I had 11 steps, which included the outermost multiplication by 3 as step11. So, that's why I got 265,719. But that's incorrect because the outermost expression is only 3*(Layer9), which is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by computing it step by step correctly.\n\nLayer1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nTotal expression:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers. Now, after carefully recounting and verifying, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the expression simplifies step by step. \n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by writing down the expression more clearly, maybe numbering the parentheses to make it easier. So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1+3), I can work my way outwards. Let me count how many nested expressions there are. Each time there's a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...), so let's see:\n\n1. The innermost part is (1 + 3), let's call this level 1.\n2. Then, moving out one level, it's 3*(level 1 result) + 1, which would be level 2.\n3. Then level 3 would be 3*(level 2 result) + 1, and so on.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, each term is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So starting from the innermost, let me denote each level as follows:\n\nLet me assign each innermost expression a variable to make it manageable. Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the inside out. Let me start by letting the innermost expression be a0, then a1, a2, up to a8 because I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses, so nine levels. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) parts. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so let's count:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), that's one level.\n2. Then moving out, the next is (1 + 3*(innermost)), that's two levels.\n3. Continuing outward, each time adding another layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a new level. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then the next level is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next level: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Then 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Then 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Then 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Then 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm counting correctly. Let me parse the expression more carefully. Each time, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards, calculating each level as I go.\n\nSo, let's define each level as follows:\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as a0 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, a1 = 1 + 3*a0.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2.\n\nAnd so on, until I reach a8, since there are nine layers (including the innermost a0).\n\nWait, but let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of (1 + 3*...). So starting from the innermost, each a_i is defined as 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a0 = 1 + 3.\n\nSo let's compute each a_i step by step.\n\na0 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na1 = 1 + 3*a0 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, so a8 is the value of the innermost expression after all the layers. But the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a8, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(a8). Wait, no, actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(a1), but wait, perhaps I got the indexing wrong.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let's parse the original expression again:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, the innermost is a0 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a1 = 1 + 3*a0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 121.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 364.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1093.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 3280.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 9841.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 29524.\n\nNow, the original expression is 3*(a8). Wait, no. Let me see: the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be 3*(a1), because a1 is 1 + 3*a0, but in our case, the innermost is a0, then a1 is the next layer, and so on, up to a8. But the outermost expression is 3*(a1), because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(a1). Wait, that can't be right because we have eight more layers after a1. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Each time, we have a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. (1 + 3*(4)) = 13.\n\n3. (1 + 3*(13)) = 40.\n\n4. (1 + 3*(40)) = 121.\n\n5. (1 + 3*(121)) = 364.\n\n6. (1 + 3*(364)) = 1093.\n\n7. (1 + 3*(1093)) = 3280.\n\n8. (1 + 3*(3280)) = 9841.\n\n9. (1 + 3*(9841)) = 29524.\n\n10. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524).\n\nWait, so that's 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, did I count correctly? Because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, so the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, meaning that the outermost is 3*(a8), where a8 is the result after nine layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, a8 was 29524, and then the outermost is 3*a8, which is 88572. But let me check that again.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then, moving outward, each time we have a (1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, the number of layers is 9, meaning that the outermost expression is 3*(a8), where a8 is the result after 9 layers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had a0 through a8, each built from the previous, and then the outermost is 3*a8, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me confirm each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nCompute a0 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na1 = 1 + 3*a0 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a8 = 3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this multiplication again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the number of layers again. Each time, we have a new layer, so starting from the innermost (1+3), that's layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, in the original expression, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's the first layer.\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. (1 + 3*(...)) where ... is the first layer.\n\n3. (1 + 3*(...)) where ... is the second layer.\n\nContinuing until we reach the outermost layer, which is 3*(...).\n\nWait, so from the innermost to the outermost, we have 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), and then the outermost is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me write it out step by step:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous), and after nine layers, we get 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by another method. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nLet me see: the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, a0 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a0 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a0 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=0: a0 = (9*1 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\nn=1: (9*3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches a1=13.\n\nn=2: (9*9 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which matches a2=40.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have a8, since we have nine layers (from a0 to a8). So, a8 = (9*3^8 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, a8 = (9*6561 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*a8=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it using both iterative step-by-step calculation and the recurrence relation formula, and both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times the next inner term. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(inner term). There are nine such layers, starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The outermost expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " That makes sense because in order of operations, we solve the innermost parentheses first. So, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out, simplifying each layer as I go. Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, so there are nine layers here, each starting with a 3 multiplied by a (1 + 3(...)). Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, each step will be manageable. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me compute that.\n\nSo, the next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me calculate that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 13, so this becomes 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, this layer is 121.\n\nNext, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(121). Calculating that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, that's 364.\n\nProceeding further, the next layer is 1 + 3*(364). Let's see: 3*364 is 1092, and 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that: 3*1093 is 3279, and 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Calculating: 3*3280 is 9840, and 1 + 9840 is 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute that: 3*9841 is 29523, and 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me calculate that: 3*29524 is 88572, and 1 + 88572 is 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original problem starts with a 3 multiplied by this entire expression. So, after simplifying all the parentheses, we have 3*(the result we just got). Let me make sure I didn't miss that.\n\nWait, let me go back. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after I simplified the innermost parentheses all the way to 88573, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by 88573. So, I need to compute 3*88573.\n\nLet me calculate that: 3*88573. Let's break it down. 80,000 * 3 is 240,000. 8,000 * 3 is 24,000. 500 * 3 is 1,500. 70 * 3 is 210. 3 * 3 is 9. So, adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000. 264,000 + 1,500 is 265,500. 265,500 + 210 is 265,710. 265,710 + 9 is 265,719. So, 3*88573 is 265,719.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. Alternatively, I can compute 88,573 * 3:\n\n88,573\n*        3\n----------\n265,719\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*88,573 is indeed 265,719.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the number of layers because I might have miscounted how many times I applied the 1 + 3*(...) operation.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nLet me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(result1))\n3. (1 + 3*(result2))\n4. (1 + 3*(result3))\n5. (1 + 3*(result4))\n6. (1 + 3*(result5))\n7. (1 + 3*(result6))\n8. (1 + 3*(result7))\n9. (1 + 3*(result8))\n10. (1 + 3*(result9))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)) and then the outermost 3 multiplied by the 9th layer's result. So, maybe I miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. Let's list them:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Next: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 364\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n10. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went one step further, getting to 88573, but that might not be correct because the outermost layer is just 3 multiplied by the 9th layer's result, which is 29524. So, 3*29524 is 88572, not 88573. Hmm, I think I added an extra 1 somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check each step again carefully.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the result inside the outermost parentheses is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result: 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29,524.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 30,000 * 3 = 90,000.\n\nBut since it's 29,524, which is 30,000 - 476.\n\nSo, 3*(30,000 - 476) = 90,000 - (3*476).\n\nCalculate 3*476: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200 + 210 = 1410 + 18 = 1428.\n\nSo, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 265,719, but that was when I thought the innermost result was 88,573, which seems incorrect now. So, the correct result should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, the original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) terms.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nEach time, we have a (1 + 3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n...\nContinuing until we reach the outermost.\n\nLet me count how many times the pattern (1 + 3*(...)) occurs.\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each time we have a (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nStarting after the first (:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n10. (1 + 3))))))))))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers, each starting with (1 + 3(...)). So, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)).\n\nSo, after computing each layer, we have the 9th layer's result as 29,524, and then we multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final result should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to 88573, I think I miscounted the layers, adding an extra 1 somewhere. So, the correct result is 88,572.\n\nLet me double-check each step once more to be certain.\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I made a mistake earlier by counting one extra layer, leading me to an incorrect final result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to approach this problem instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, perhaps. Let me recall the formula for solving a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c.\n\nIn this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3 and c=1.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_n^p = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B.\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59,049. So, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the result we got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression after 9 layers is 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that confirms our earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid now. I just need to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59,049. Then, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524: Let's compute 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524\n*      3\n--------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's it. I've verified it through both step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation formula. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, I see that each time, there's a 3 multiplied by a sum of 1 and another expression. Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3 times a new parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. \n\nStarting from the left, the first term is 3 times (1 + ...), and each time I go deeper, there's another (1 + ...). Let me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are nine layers of parentheses here. That means I need to compute starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and work my way back to the first one.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost. So, L9 is 1 + 3, then L8 is 1 + 3*(L9), and so on, until L1, which is the outermost expression, which is 3*(L2). \n\nLet me write this out step by step:\n\n- L9: 1 + 3\n- L8: 1 + 3*(L9)\n- L7: 1 + 3*(L8)\n- L6: 1 + 3*(L7)\n- L5: 1 + 3*(L8)\nWait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next inner layer). So, actually, each L is defined as 1 + 3*(next L). So, starting from L9, which is the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, then L8 is 1 + 3*(L9), L7 is 1 + 3*(L8), and so on, until L1 is 3*(L2). Wait, no, actually, looking back at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, the outermost expression is 3*(L2), because L2 is the first inner expression after the outermost 3.\n\nWait, maybe I should index them differently. Let me try to list each layer from the innermost to the outermost. So, starting with the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nWait, hold on, that seems like a lot. Let me check each step carefully because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. L9: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. L8: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. L7: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. L6: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. L5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. L4: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. L3: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. L2: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. L1: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Outermost: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each step again to be sure.\n\nStarting with L9: 1 + 3 is straightforward, 4.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL1: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 41*3=123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 30000*3=90000, subtract 476*3=1428, so 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 29524 is 29524, so 3*29524. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in each step. It's easy to slip up with larger numbers, so I'll go through each layer again quickly.\n\n- L9: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L8: 1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L7: 1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L6: 1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L5: 1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L4: 1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L3: 1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L2: 1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n- L1: 1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n- Outermost: 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLooks like all the steps check out. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if I can find a general formula for this kind of expression.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant. Let me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, let me see. Let's write out the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier. So, this is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P\n\nSolving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see, starting from the innermost as layer 1, going outwards, we have 9 layers. Wait, no, in the original expression, the innermost is 1+3, which is layer 9, and the outermost is 3*(L2). Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indexing here.\n\nWait, in the original problem, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the 9th layer, right? Because each opening parenthesis adds a layer, and there are 9 opening parentheses inside the outermost 3. So, the innermost is layer 9, and each outer layer is layer 8, 7, etc., up to layer 1, which is the outermost 3*(...).\n\nWait, so if I have 9 layers, then for layer n, where n=1 is the innermost, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, layer 1: (3^2 -1)/2 =4, layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2=13, and so on, up to layer 9: (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(L2), where L2 is the second layer from the innermost. So, if layer 1 is 1+3=4, layer 2 is 1+3*4=13, then the outermost expression is 3*13=39? Wait, no, that can't be because earlier, when computing step by step, the outermost was 88572. So, perhaps my indexing is off.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to index the layers differently. Let me think: The innermost expression is 1+3, which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, in the original expression, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3, then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1), layer3: 1 +3*(layer2), and so on until layer9: 1 +3*(layer8). Then, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). Wait, but in the original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1 +3*(...)), so the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire inner expression, which is layer9.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had:\n\n- L9:4\n\n- L8:13\n\n- L7:40\n\n- L6:121\n\n- L5:364\n\n- L4:1093\n\n- L3:3280\n\n- L2:9841\n\n- L1:29524\n\nThen outermost: 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, in this case, L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because L1 is the innermost, and each subsequent L is outer. So, in the original expression, the innermost is L1:1+3=4, then L2:1+3*4=13, L3:1+3*13=40, and so on until L9:1+3*(L8)=29524, and then the outermost expression is 3*(L9)=88572.\n\nWait, so in this case, the outermost expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is the 9th layer. So, the general formula for Lk is (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, L1: (3^2 -1)/2=4, L2: (3^3 -1)/2=13, L3: (3^4 -1)/2=40, and so on. Therefore, L9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute the result without having to manually compute each layer, which is helpful, especially if the number of layers increases.\n\nBut in this problem, since there are 9 layers, it's manageable to compute step by step, but it's good to know the formula for future reference.\n\nLet me just recap:\n\n1. Recognize that the expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. Starting from the innermost layer, compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.\n\n3. Continue this process until reaching the outermost layer.\n\n4. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula derived from the linear recurrence relation, each layer Lk can be expressed as (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for k=9, L9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nEither way, the result is the same.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified each computation carefully. It's easy to make an arithmetic mistake with such large numbers, so it's important to double-check each step, especially the multiplication steps where numbers get big quickly.\n\nIn summary, the key steps were:\n\n- Identifying the nested structure and working from the innermost layer outward.\n\n- Using a step-by-step approach to compute each layer.\n\n- Verifying each computation to avoid errors.\n\n- Optionally, recognizing the pattern and using a formula to compute the result more efficiently.\n\nThis problem is a good exercise in handling nested expressions and demonstrates how recurrence relations can be applied to simplify the computation process.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer (Layer 9): 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Outermost expression: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, let me start by writing down the expression in a way that I can tackle each part one by one. The innermost part is $1+3$. That's straightforward: 1 plus 3 is 4. So, I can replace that with 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is $1 + 3(4)$. Wait, let me make sure I'm doing that correctly. The next layer is $1 + 3(1 + 3(...))$, but since I already solved the innermost part, it's $1 + 3(4)$. So, 3 times 4 is 12, and then adding 1 gives me 13. \n\nAlright, so now I can replace that entire part with 13. Moving out another layer, the next expression is $1 + 3(13)$. Let me calculate that: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that part simplifies to 40. I'll keep going like this, each time replacing the innermost solved expression with its value and moving outward. \n\nNext, I have $1 + 3(40)$. Calculating that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that simplifies to 121. Continuing this process, the next layer is $1 + 3(121)$. Hmm, 3 times 121 is 363, and adding 1 gives me 364. \n\nMoving outward another step, the expression becomes $1 + 3(364)$. Let's compute that: 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, that part is 1093. Now, the next layer is $1 + 3(1093)$. Calculating that: 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. \n\nContinuing on, the next expression is $1 + 3(3280)$. Let's see: 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, that simplifies to 9841. Moving another step outward, the expression is $1 + 3(9841)$. Calculating that: 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. \n\nNext, the layer is $1 + 3(29524)$. Let me work that out: 3 times 29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. So, that part becomes 88573. Moving out one more layer, we have $1 + 3(88573)$. Calculating that: 3 times 88573 is 265719, plus 1 is 265720. \n\nFinally, the outermost expression is $3(265720)$. So, multiplying that gives 3 times 265720, which is 797160. Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 265720 times 3: 200,000 times 3 is 600,000, 60,000 times 3 is 180,000, 5,000 times 3 is 15,000, 700 times 3 is 2,100, and 20 times 3 is 60. Adding those together: 600,000 + 180,000 is 780,000, plus 15,000 is 795,000, plus 2,100 is 797,100, plus 60 is 797,160. Yep, that looks correct. \n\nWait a minute, I think I might have missed a step somewhere because when I was simplifying each layer, I counted each step, but let me recount to make sure I didn't skip any layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4, then 1+3*4=13, then 1+3*13=40, then 1+3*40=121, then 1+3*121=364, then 1+3*364=1093, then 1+3*1093=3280, then 1+3*3280=9841, then 1+3*9841=29524, then 1+3*29524=88573, then 1+3*88573=265720, and finally 3*265720=797160. \n\nWait, let me count the number of layers. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me check: starting from the innermost, each time I added a layer, so starting from 1+3, then each step adds another layer. So, from the innermost to the outermost, that's nine layers. Let me recount:\n\n1. 1+3=4\n2. 1+3*4=13\n3. 1+3*13=40\n4. 1+3*40=121\n5. 1+3*121=364\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n10. 1+3*29524=88573\n11. 1+3*88573=265720\n12. 3*265720=797160\n\nWait, that's 12 steps, but the original problem has 9 sets of parentheses. Hmm, maybe I'm overcounting. Let me look again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, perhaps each time I replace a layer, I'm moving one step closer to the center, so maybe I should have 9 layers, each time moving from the innermost to the outermost. Let me try again, this time carefully counting each step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*265720 = 797160\n\nWait, that's 12 steps, but the problem only has nine layers. Maybe I'm including the initial 3*(...) as a step. Let me check the original problem again: it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine (1+3(...)) terms. So, perhaps I should only have nine layers after the initial 3. Let me try to recount, making sure I don't include the initial 3 as a layer.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*265720 = 797160\n\nWait, I'm still getting 12 steps. Maybe the initial 3*(...) is the 10th step, but the problem has nine inner expressions. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe I should just proceed step by step without worrying about the count and just ensure each step is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, and then the final result is 3*a_9. \n\nWait, that might be a better approach. Let me try that. So, if I define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. \n\nSo, let me compute each a_i step by step:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, that's only up to a_9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. \n\nCalculating that: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Wait, that's different from my earlier result. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, earlier when I was computing step by step, I ended up with 797160, but now with this method, I'm getting 88572. Clearly, one of these is wrong. Let me check where I might have gone wrong.\n\nWait, in the initial problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so up to nine layers. So, a_1 is the innermost, a_2 is the next, up to a_9, which is the outermost before the final 3*(a_9). So, according to this, a_9 is 29524, and 3*a_9 is 88572. \n\nBut earlier, when I was computing step by step, I went up to a_11 being 265720, then multiplied by 3 to get 797160. So, clearly, I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me figure out where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial problem has nine layers of (1 + 3(...)), which would mean that a_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. Therefore, the correct approach is to compute up to a_9 and then multiply by 3. So, according to this, a_9 is 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572. But earlier, when I was computing step by step, I thought I had 12 layers, which was incorrect.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of layers in the problem. The problem is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) terms. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3*(...))\n3. (1 + 3*(...))\n4. (1 + 3*(...))\n5. (1 + 3*(...))\n6. (1 + 3*(...))\n7. (1 + 3*(...))\n8. (1 + 3*(...))\n9. (1 + 3*(...))\n\nSo, there are nine (1 + 3(...)) terms, each nested within the previous one. Therefore, a_1 is the innermost, a_9 is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, a_9 is 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572. \n\nBut earlier, when I was computing step by step, I ended up with 797160, which is much larger. So, I must have miscounted the number of layers. Let me see where that happened. When I was computing step by step earlier, I went up to 265720 and then multiplied by 3 to get 797160. But according to the correct count, I should have stopped at a_9 = 29524 and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. \n\nWait, perhaps I added an extra layer in my initial step-by-step computation. Let me check. The problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so layer 2, up to layer 9. Therefore, when I computed up to a_9 = 29524, that's correct, and then 3*a_9 = 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 797160, which suggests that I was computing beyond a_9. Let me see where I went wrong. In my initial step-by-step, I went up to 1 + 3*88573 = 265720, which would be layer 11, and then multiplied by 3 to get 797160. But according to the problem, there are only nine layers, so I must have added two extra layers mistakenly. \n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The problem is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each (1 + 3*(...)) is a layer. Let me count the number of times I see (1 + 3*(...)): starting from the first (1 + 3*(...)) after the initial 3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent (1 + 3*(...)) is another layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1 + 3*(...)) after the initial 3\n2. Next (1 + 3*(...))\n3. Next\n4. Next\n5. Next\n6. Next\n7. Next\n8. Next\n9. Next\n10. Next\n\nWait, that's 10 layers. Wait, no, perhaps I'm including the initial 3 as a layer. Let me look again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then each (1 + 3*(...)) is another layer. Let me count the number of (1 + 3*(...)) expressions:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1.\n- Then each (1 + 3*(...)) is a layer. So, the next one is layer 2, and so on, up to layer 9. So, there are nine layers in total. Therefore, a_9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, according to this, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. \n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to a_9 = 29524, I thought that was correct, but then I got confused because my initial step-by-step gave me a different answer. Let me try to reconcile this. Perhaps I made a mistake in my initial step-by-step computation by adding extra layers beyond the nine required. \n\nLet me try to compute a_1 through a_9 again carefully:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, a_9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. \n\nWait, but earlier when I did the step-by-step, I had 1 + 3*88573 = 265720, which would be a_10, but the problem only has nine layers, so that must be where I went wrong. I mistakenly continued beyond the nine layers, adding layers 10 and 11, which don't exist in the problem. Therefore, the correct answer should be 88572, not 797160.\n\nWait, let me verify this again. If the problem has nine layers, then a_9 is 29524, and 3*a_9 is 88572. Let me check this with a smaller example to see if my approach is correct. Suppose the problem was 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). That would be three layers: a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, then 3*a_3 = 120. Let me compute it manually:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120\n\nYes, that works. So, if I have three layers, I compute a_1, a_2, a_3, then 3*a_3. Similarly, in the original problem with nine layers, I compute up to a_9 and then multiply by 3. Therefore, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed up to a_9, I thought that was 29524, but when I multiplied by 3, I got 88572. But in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond a_9, which was incorrect. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach by adding extra layers beyond the nine required.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572. But let me double-check this by computing each step again carefully:\n\n1. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by continuing beyond the nine layers, which led me to the incorrect answer of 797160. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me try computing the expression from the inside out without using the a_i notation, just to confirm. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I've convinced myself that the correct answer is 88572. My earlier mistake was continuing beyond the nine layers, which was incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute:\n\n1. \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost result by 3 gives:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start by identifying the innermost part of the expression. Looking at it, the innermost part is the last (1+3). Let me write that down: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, I can replace that innermost part with 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression would be (1 + 3*(result from the previous step)). Wait, so after replacing the innermost (1+3) with 4, the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression would be (1 + 3*(13)). Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer becomes 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer would be (1 + 3*40). Calculating that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that layer is 121.\n\nNext, moving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*121). Let me compute 3*121 first. 121 times 3 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. So, this layer is 364.\n\nContinuing further, the next layer is (1 + 3*364). Calculating 3*364: 364 times 3 is 1,092. Adding 1 gives 1,093. So, this layer is 1,093.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*1,093). Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,093 * 3 is 3,279. Adding 1 gives 3,280. So, this part is 3,280.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*3,280). Calculating 3*3,280: 3,280 * 3 is 9,840. Adding 1 gives 9,841. So, this becomes 9,841.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's (1 + 3*9,841). Let me compute 3*9,841: 9,841 * 3. Let me break that down. 9,000 * 3 is 27,000, 800 * 3 is 2,400, 40 * 3 is 120, and 1 * 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400, plus 120 is 29,520, plus 3 is 29,523. So, 3*9,841 is 29,523. Adding 1 gives 29,524. So, this layer is 29,524.\n\nContinuing, the next layer is (1 + 3*29,524). Calculating 3*29,524: Let me do 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 is 60,000, 9,000 * 3 is 27,000, 500 * 3 is 1,500, 24 * 3 is 72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000, plus 1,500 is 88,500, plus 72 is 88,572. So, 3*29,524 is 88,572. Adding 1 gives 88,573. So, this part is 88,573.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, the expression becomes (1 + 3*88,573). Let me compute 3*88,573. Let's break it down: 80,000 * 3 is 240,000, 8,000 * 3 is 24,000, 500 * 3 is 1,500, 70 * 3 is 210, and 3 * 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000, plus 1,500 is 265,500, plus 210 is 265,710, plus 9 is 265,719. So, 3*88,573 is 265,719. Adding 1 gives 265,720. So, this layer is 265,720.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*265,720). Let me compute 3*265,720. 200,000 * 3 is 600,000, 60,000 * 3 is 180,000, 5,000 * 3 is 15,000, 700 * 3 is 2,100, 20 * 3 is 60. Adding those together: 600,000 + 180,000 is 780,000, plus 15,000 is 795,000, plus 2,100 is 797,100, plus 60 is 797,160. So, 3*265,720 is 797,160. Adding 1 gives 797,161. So, this layer is 797,161.\n\nFinally, moving out to the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3*(797,161). So, I need to compute 3 times 797,161. Let me break that down: 700,000 * 3 is 2,100,000, 90,000 * 3 is 270,000, 7,000 * 3 is 21,000, 100 * 3 is 300, 60 * 3 is 180, and 1 * 3 is 3. Adding those together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 is 2,370,000, plus 21,000 is 2,391,000, plus 300 is 2,391,300, plus 180 is 2,391,480, plus 3 is 2,391,483. So, 3*797,161 is 2,391,483.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can compute 797,161 * 3 another way. Let's see:\n\n797,161\n*         3\n----------\n2,391,483\n\nYes, that seems correct. 7*3=21, carry over 2. 6*3=18 plus 2 is 20, carry over 2. 1*3=3 plus 2 is 5. 7*3=21, carry over 2. 1*3=3 plus 2 is 5. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 7*3=21 plus 2 is 23, so that's 3 with a carryover of 2, but wait, actually, no, because we're multiplying from right to left. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, actually, when I multiply 797,161 by 3, I should start from the rightmost digit:\n\n1*3=3\n6*3=18, write down 8, carry over 1\n1*3=3 plus 1 is 4\n7*3=21, write down 1, carry over 2\n9*3=27 plus 2 is 29, write down 9, carry over 2\n7*3=21 plus 2 is 23, write down 3, carry over 2\nNow, since there are no more digits, write down the carryover 2.\n\nSo, putting it together from right to left: 3, 8, 4, 1, 9, 3, 2. So, the result is 2,391,483. That matches what I had before. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, after working through each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, I've calculated that the entire expression simplifies to 2,391,483.\n\nI think I did each step carefully, but just to make sure, let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression has multiple layers of (1 + 3(...)). Let me count them: starting from the innermost, I worked through nine layers, each time replacing the innermost part with the computed value and moving outward. The final multiplication by 3 was the outermost operation. So, yes, I think I accounted for all nine layers correctly.\n\nWait, actually, let me check the number of layers again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: each \"1+\" starts a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a new (1+3(...)). Let me count: starting from the innermost, it's (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so how many times does this happen? Let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... and so on, until it ends with (1+3))). So, how many times does the pattern repeat? Let me count the number of (1+3) expressions.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach time, except the innermost, the (1+3) is followed by another expression. So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers. Wait, let me count the number of times 1+3 appears as a standalone term, not inside another. Let me see: each time, the expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), so the number of layers is 9 because each (1+3) is one layer, and there are 9 of them. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but in any case, I worked through each layer step by step, so I think my calculation is correct.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the answer is 2,391,483.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed step by step, resulting in the final value after all multiplications and additions.\n\n$\\boxed{2391483}$"

    "text": " That makes sense because parentheses indicate that the operations inside should be done first. So, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me write that down: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next part is 1 + 3 times the result of the innermost expression. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So that layer gives me 13. Now, the next layer out is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So that's 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so that's 40. I can see a pattern here, maybe each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me check that. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Wait, that doesn't seem to fit the pattern I thought. Wait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, but 121 is 11 squared, so maybe there's a connection there. Let me continue to see if this pattern continues. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Hmm, 364. Then the next layer would be 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Then the next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Wait, 9841 is 99 squared, right? Because 100 squared is 10000, so 99 squared is 9801, but 99*99 is 9801, so 9841 is actually 99 squared plus 40, which doesn't seem like a perfect square. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check. So, 3280 times 3 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Hmm, okay, so that's correct. Then the next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then the next layer: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*(88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720. Wait, that seems really big. But let me check again: 88573 times 3 is 265,719, plus 1 is 265,720. So, the entire expression inside the parentheses is 265,720, and then the entire expression is 3 times that. So, 3 * 265,720 = 797,160. Wait, but that seems too large. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me go back through each step carefully to see if I messed up any calculations.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(265,720) = 797,160.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the number of layers correctly. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach \"1+3(...\" is a layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each step adds a layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nLooking at the problem:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a separate layer. Let me count:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3(...))\n3. Then another, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, each time you go out a layer, you add another (1+3(...)). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer out adds another (1+3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" starts a new layer. So:\n\n- 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the first 3, the first (1+3 is the innermost, then each subsequent (1+3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...)\n3. (1+3(...)\n4. (1+3(...)\n5. (1+3(...)\n6. (1+3(...)\n7. (1+3(...)\n8. (1+3(...)\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, so from the first 3, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)) because each (1+3 is a new layer. Wait, no, actually, the structure is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(...))). So, each time you have a new (1+3, it's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have? Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3). Then moving out, each time you have another (1+3(...)), so how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of times the pattern (1+3 appears. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first (1+3 is the innermost, then each subsequent (1+3 is a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n10. (1+3(...))\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me try a different approach. Let me write down the expression with the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 3*(Layer 2)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n\n...\n\nEach layer is defined as 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from Layer 9, which is the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 such instances after the initial 3.\n\nWait, let me think again. The original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer 9, then each layer out adds another (1 + 3*Layer). So, Layer 9: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*Layer9 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, but that's only 9 layers, right? From Layer 9 to Layer 1.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(Layer1), so the total expression is 3*Layer1, where Layer1 is 29524.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was calculating, I went up to Layer0? Or maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to structure it properly.\n\nLet me define each layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\nLet me number the layers starting from the innermost as Layer 1.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n\nLayer 11: 1 + 3*(Layer10) = 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n\nWait, but the original expression only has 9 layers of (1+3(...)), right? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3 is a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)), meaning that the innermost is Layer 9, and the outermost before the final multiplication by 3 is Layer 1. So, Layer 9: 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier. So, I think I miscounted the layers before. So, if there are 9 layers of (1+3(...)), then Layer 1 is the outermost, and Layer 9 is the innermost.\n\nWait, so starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems more consistent. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier by going beyond 9 layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time you have a (1+3(...)), that's a new layer. Let's count the number of (1+3:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n4. (1+3(...))\n5. (1+3(...))\n6. (1+3(...))\n7. (1+3(...))\n8. (1+3(...))\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is the innermost, Layer 8 is next, up to Layer 1, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nSo, computing each layer:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer1 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when I first thought I was getting 797,160, I had gone beyond 9 layers, which wasn't correct. So, the correct total should be 88,572.\n\nBut let me verify this by computing each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_{n-1} is the previous layer. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_n^(p) = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's say when n=9 (innermost layer), L_9 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^9 - 1/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, 4 = C*19683 - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = C*19683 => 4.5 = C*19683\n\nThus, C = 4.5 / 19683 = (9/2) / 19683 = 9 / (2*19683) = 9 / 39366 = 3 / 13122.\n\nSimplify 3/13122: divide numerator and denominator by 3: 1/4374.\n\nSo, C = 1/4374.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (1/4374)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nBut wait, let me check this. When n=9, L_9 = (1/4374)*3^9 - 1/2.\n\nCompute 3^9 = 19683, so (1/4374)*19683 = 19683 / 4374.\n\nCompute 19683 \u00f7 4374: Let's see, 4374 * 4 = 17,496. 19,683 - 17,496 = 2,187. 4374 * 0.5 = 2,187. So, 4.5. So, 19683 / 4374 = 4.5.\n\nThus, L_9 = 4.5 - 0.5 = 4, which matches. Good.\n\nNow, we need to find L_1, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3. Since n=1 corresponds to the outermost layer, let's see what n is for the outermost layer.\n\nWait, actually, in our earlier approach, Layer 9 was the innermost, and Layer 1 was the outermost. So, in terms of the recurrence, n=1 is the outermost, and n=9 is the innermost. So, perhaps in the formula, n=1 corresponds to the outermost, so we need to find L_1.\n\nWait, no, in the recurrence relation, n increases as we go inward, so perhaps n=1 is the innermost. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider n as the number of layers from the innermost. So, if we have 9 layers, n=9 corresponds to the innermost, and n=1 corresponds to the outermost.\n\nSo, to find L_1, which is the outermost layer, we can plug n=1 into the general solution.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the general solution is built from the innermost layer. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to reverse the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the outermost layer is n=9, and the innermost is n=1. Wait, no, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, let me think differently. Since each layer is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, starting from L_1 = 4 (innermost), then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to L_9.\n\nBut in our problem, the outermost layer is L_9, which is 29524, as we computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but according to the recurrence relation, if we have 9 layers, starting from L_1=4, then L_9 would be the result of applying the recurrence 8 times. So, perhaps the formula is L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. Let me compute L_n for n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but L_1=4, so that doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for L_n where L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nWe can write the recurrence as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, let's assume L_n^(p) = A, a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4.5 => C = 1.5.\n\nThus, L_n = 1.5*3^n - 0.5.\n\nSimplify 1.5 as 3/2, so L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4, which matches.\n\nn=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=29524, correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me compute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the computed value is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another 3*(...)). I think the key here is to start from the innermost part and work my way out. That way, I can compute each layer step by step without getting confused. \n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps that with 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, I think there are nine layers here because each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, and I can see that there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, maybe I need to compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me try to represent each layer as a term, say, a1, a2, a3, etc., where a1 is the innermost expression, and a9 is the outermost one. That might help me keep track of each step.\n\nSo, starting with the innermost expression:\n\na1 = 1 + 3\n\nThat's straightforward. Let me compute that.\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have:\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1\n\nSince a1 is 4, substituting that in:\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so a2 is 13. Next layer out is:\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2\n\nSubstituting a2 = 13:\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, a3 is 40. Let's keep going.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, so each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1 = 4. So, I computed up to a9, which is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by a9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*a9.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because when I do 29524 * 3, I can also compute it as 30000*3 = 90000, minus 476*3. Because 29524 is 30000 - 476.\n\nSo, 30000*3 = 90000\n\n476*3 = 1428\n\nSo, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, the total value of the expression is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each a_n step. Let me go through each step again just to verify.\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\na6 = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\na7 = 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\na8 = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\na9 = 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to cross-verify. Maybe there's a pattern here that I can model with a formula instead of computing each step manually. Since each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's solve the homogeneous part: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since the original problem has nine layers, n=9.\n\nSo, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, 3*a9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Yep, same answer.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which is much faster, especially for larger n. But since n=9, it's manageable either way.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my initial step-by-step computation, let me go through each a_n again:\n\na1 = 1+3=4.\n\na2=1+3*4=1+12=13.\n\na3=1+3*13=1+39=40.\n\na4=1+3*40=1+120=121.\n\na5=1+3*121=1+363=364.\n\na6=1+3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\na7=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\na8=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\na9=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula approach, I can see that each a_n is growing exponentially because each term is multiplied by 3. That makes sense because with each layer, the value is tripling and adding 1, which leads to exponential growth.\n\nJust to explore another angle, maybe I can write a small table of n vs a_n to see the pattern:\n\nn | a_n\n1 | 4\n2 | 13\n3 | 40\n4 | 121\n5 | 364\n6 | 1093\n7 | 3280\n8 | 9841\n9 | 29524\n\nLooking at this, each a_n is 3*a_{n-1} +1, so each term is indeed 3 times the previous plus 1. The numbers are growing quickly, as expected.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is effectively contributing a geometric series. The innermost term is 4, then each subsequent layer adds another factor of 3. So, the total value is like 3^9 * (1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8) + something, but I think the formula approach is cleaner.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see.\n\nGiven that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the formula, or think in terms of geometric series, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nI think I've verified this thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is defined by multiplying 3 with (1 plus the next layer). By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can compute each layer step by step or derive a closed-form formula. Using the formula approach, each term a_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That makes sense because in order to compute something inside parentheses, you start from the innermost one and work your way out.\n\nSo, let me try to write this out step by step. The innermost part of the expression is the last (1+3). Let me start there and work my way outward. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(1+...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. There are nine sets of parentheses, so that means there are nine layers here. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write down each layer separately to make it clearer. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, where L9 is the innermost one.\n\nSo, L9: 1 + 3\n\nThen, L8: 1 + 3*(L9)\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L8)\n\nAnd so on, until L1: 3*(L2). Wait, actually, the outermost operation is 3*(something). Let me check the original problem again: it's 3 times the entire expression, which is (1 + 3*(...)). So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is L9: 1 + 3.\n\nLet me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with L9: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L8: 1 + 3*(L9) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext, L7: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL1: 3*(L2) = 3*9841. Let me compute that: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure.\n\nStarting with L9: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 +3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 +3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000+279=3279. 1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 +3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. 9000+840=9840. 1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL1: 3*9841. Let's compute that again. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a very large number. Let me think if there's a pattern or formula that could make this easier instead of computing each layer step by step, which is time-consuming and prone to error.\n\nI recall that expressions like this, where each term is a constant plus a multiple of the next term, can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nL9: 4\n\nL8:13\n\nL7:40\n\nL6:121\n\nL5:364\n\nL4:1093\n\nL3:3280\n\nL2:9841\n\nL1:29523\n\nWait a minute, these numbers seem familiar. Let me check if each term is 4 times the previous term minus 1 or something like that. Let's see:\n\nFrom L9=4 to L8=13: 4*3 +1=13. Because 4*3=12 +1=13. Hmm, that works.\n\nFrom L8=13 to L7=40: 13*3 +1=40? 13*3=39 +1=40. Yes.\n\nFrom L7=40 to L6=121: 40*3 +1=121? 40*3=120 +1=121. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 121*3 +1=364. 121*3=363 +1=364. Correct.\n\n364*3 +1=1093. 364*3=1092 +1=1093. Correct.\n\n1093*3 +1=3280. 1093*3=3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\n3280*3 +1=9841. 3280*3=9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\n9841*3 +1=29524. Wait, but L1 is 3*9841=29523. Hmm, that's not matching. So, the pattern breaks at the last step. So, perhaps the pattern is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, except for the last step where it's just 3 times the previous layer.\n\nWait, but in the last step, L1 is 3*(L2), which is 3*9841=29523. So, the pattern is that each layer is 3 times the next layer plus 1, except the outermost layer which is just 3 times the inner layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_9 = 4, a_8 =13, a_7=40, etc. Then, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, for n from 1 to 8, and a_9=4.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted. Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as a geometric series.\n\nLet me think: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3))...)). There are nine 1's, right? Wait, no, let me count. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 and another 3. So, the number of terms is nine layers, each with a 1 and a 3. Hmm, maybe it's easier to think of it as a sum of a geometric series with a common ratio.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 +3))))). But since there are nine layers, maybe I can express E in terms of itself, but that might not be straightforward because each layer is only part of the expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each layer is 1 + 3*next_layer, so starting from the innermost layer, which is 4, each previous layer is 1 + 3*next_layer.\n\nWait, so L9=4\n\nL8=1 +3*L9=1 +12=13\n\nL7=1 +3*L8=1 +39=40\n\nL6=1 +3*L7=1 +120=121\n\nL5=1 +3*L6=1 +363=364\n\nL4=1 +3*L5=1 +1092=1093\n\nL3=1 +3*L4=1 +3279=3280\n\nL2=1 +3*L3=1 +9840=9841\n\nL1=3*L2=3*9841=29523\n\nSo, that's the same as before. So, the final answer is 29523.\n\nWait, but let me verify this another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me try to compute each layer again more carefully.\n\nStarting with L9: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nL8:1 +3*4=1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nL7:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nL6:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nL4:1 +3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nL3:1 +3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nL2:1 +3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nL1:3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Correct.\n\nHmm, so it seems that each step checks out. So, the final answer is 29523. Therefore, the value of the expression is 29523.\n\nBut wait, let me think if there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be expressed using the formula for a geometric series, but in this case, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but the number of terms is finite, specifically nine terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1 +3, then each layer adds another 1 and another 3 multiplied by the previous.\n\nWait, but actually, each layer is 1 +3*(next layer). So, if I let x be the value of the innermost layer, which is 4, then the next layer is 1 +3x, and so on, up to the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, maybe I can express this as a sum where each term is 1 multiplied by 3 raised to some power, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of 1's each multiplied by 3 raised to the appropriate power, considering the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me try to think recursively. Let me define the value of the nth layer as a_n, where n=1 is the innermost layer. Wait, no, in this case, n=9 is the innermost layer, so maybe I should adjust that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a function f(k) where k is the number of layers. So, f(k) = 1 + 3*f(k-1), with f(1)=4, since the innermost layer is 1+3=4.\n\nWait, but in this problem, there are nine layers, so f(9) would be the innermost layer, which is 4, and f(8)=1 +3*f(9)=1 +12=13, and so on, up to f(0)=3*f(1). Wait, but in our problem, the outermost layer is 3*(f(1)), which is 3*f(1). So, perhaps f(k) represents the value at each layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(k). The recurrence relation is f(k) = 1 +3*f(k+1), with f(9)=4. Wait, that seems a bit backward because usually, recurrence relations go in one direction, but here it's f(k) depending on f(k+1). That might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reverse the order. Let me define f(k) as the value starting from the outermost layer. So, f(1) would be the innermost layer, which is 4, and f(2)=1 +3*f(1)=1 +12=13, f(3)=1 +3*f(2)=1 +39=40, and so on, up to f(9)=1 +3*f(8). Then, the outermost layer is 3*f(9). Wait, that might be a better way to model it.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the outermost operation is 3*(...), so if I define f(k) as the value of the kth layer from the inside, then f(1)=4, f(2)=1 +3*f(1)=13, f(3)=1 +3*f(2)=40, etc., up to f(9)=1 +3*f(8). Then, the outermost expression is 3*f(9). Wait, but in our earlier calculation, we had L1=3*L2=3*9841=29523, which would correspond to 3*f(9)=29523.\n\nWait, but let me see if I can find a general formula for f(k). The recurrence is f(k) = 1 +3*f(k-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution would be f(k) = A*3^k, and the particular solution would be a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 +3*C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is f(k) = A*3^k -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition f(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, f(k)= (3/2)*3^k -1/2= (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{k+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for k=9, f(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step-by-step calculation, we found that f(9)=9841, which when multiplied by 3 gives 29523, which is one less than 29524. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, perhaps I made a mistake in defining f(k).\n\nWait, let me check the recurrence again. If f(k)=1 +3*f(k-1), with f(1)=4, then f(2)=1 +3*4=13, f(3)=1 +3*13=40, etc. So, using the formula f(k)=(3^{k+1} -1)/2, for k=1, f(1)=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches. For k=2, f(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches. For k=3, f(3)=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For k=4, f(4)=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. For k=5, f(5)=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct. For k=6, f(6)=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct. For k=7, f(7)=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct. For k=8, f(8)=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct. For k=9, f(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWait, but according to our earlier step-by-step calculation, the outermost layer is 3*f(9)=3*9841=29523, but according to the formula, f(9)=29524, which would mean that the outermost layer is 3*29524=88572, which doesn't match our earlier result. So, there must be a misunderstanding in how I'm defining f(k).\n\nWait, perhaps the formula f(k)=(3^{k+1} -1)/2 gives the value at the kth layer, where k=1 is the innermost layer, which is 4. So, f(9)=29524. Then, the outermost layer is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572, which contradicts our earlier step-by-step calculation where we got 29523. So, clearly, there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me check again. The formula f(k)=(3^{k+1}-1)/2 gives the value at the kth layer, starting from the innermost as k=1. So, for k=9, f(9)= (3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the outermost layer is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572, which is way larger than our step-by-step result of 29523. So, clearly, something's wrong here.\n\nWait, but in our step-by-step calculation, the outermost layer was 3*f(9)=3*9841=29523, but according to the formula, f(9)=29524, which suggests that perhaps I misapplied the formula. Alternatively, maybe the formula is for the entire expression, not just the inner layers.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem. The problem is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire expression inside, which is (1 +3*(...)). So, if I denote E as the entire expression, then E=3*(1 +3*(...)), and the innermost part is (1+3)=4.\n\nWait, perhaps I should define E as the entire expression, which is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))). Let me see how many times the 3 is multiplied. Each time, the expression inside is 1 +3*(next expression). So, if there are nine layers, then the innermost is 1+3=4, then each layer adds another 1 +3*(...). So, perhaps E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...+3*(1+3)))), with nine 1's and nine 3's? Wait, no, actually, each layer adds one more 1 and one more 3, so for nine layers, the innermost is 1+3, then the next is 1+3*(1+3), etc., up to nine layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model E as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with eight 3's inside. Wait, but in our earlier step-by-step calculation, we had nine layers, each adding another 1 and 3, so the number of 1's and 3's would correspond to the number of layers. Let me try to count them.\n\nLooking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the number of (1+3) terms is nine. So, the entire expression inside the outermost 3 is (1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) which has nine (1+3) terms.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula for E, the entire expression, would be E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with nine layers. So, using the formula for such expressions, which is a finite geometric series, perhaps I can express E as 3*( (3^9 -1)/ (3 -1) ). Wait, no, that's for a sum where each term is multiplied by 3, but in this case, it's a bit different because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model it as E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...))) with nine layers, which would mean that the innermost is 4, and each layer is 1 +3*next_layer. So, perhaps the formula is E=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ), but that gives 3*(59049 -1)/2=3*59048/2=3*29524=88572, which doesn't match our step-by-step result. So, clearly, that's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the step-by-step calculation gave me 29523, and each step checks out, maybe the formula approach is not applicable here, or perhaps I'm misapplying it. Alternatively, maybe the formula is for an infinite series, but in this case, it's finite, so the formula might not apply directly.\n\nWait, let me think again. The step-by-step calculation seems correct, and each layer builds on the previous one correctly. So, perhaps the final answer is indeed 29523, and the formula approach might not be the right way to go here, or I might have made a mistake in applying it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each layer is 1 +3*next_layer, so starting from the innermost layer, which is 4, each previous layer is 1 +3*next_layer. So, the second layer is 1 +3*4=13, the third is 1 +3*13=40, and so on, as we did before. So, the ninth layer is 1 +3*something, and the outermost layer is 3*that ninth layer.\n\nWait, in our earlier step-by-step, we computed up to L2=9841, then L1=3*9841=29523. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the formula again. The general solution for the recurrence f(k) =1 +3*f(k-1), with f(1)=4, is f(k)= (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for k=9, f(9)= (3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524. So, that suggests that the ninth layer is 29524, and the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572, which contradicts our earlier step-by-step.\n\nWait, but in our step-by-step, we had f(9)=9841, which is different from 29524. So, perhaps the formula is not applicable here because the problem is structured differently. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula because the number of layers is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula f(k)= (3^{k+1} -1)/2 applies when the expression is of the form f(k)=1 +3*f(k-1), starting from f(0)=something. Wait, let me check the base case. If k=1, f(1)=4, which would correspond to f(1)= (3^{2} -1)/2= (9 -1)/2=4, correct. For k=2, f(2)= (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For k=3, f(3)= (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, f(k)= (3^{k+1}-1)/2 gives the value at the kth layer, where k=1 is the innermost layer.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the outermost layer is 3*f(9), which would be 3*(3^{10}-1)/2=3*(59048)/2=3*29524=88572, which is way bigger than our step-by-step result of 29523. So, that suggests that I'm misunderstanding how the layers correspond to k in the formula.\n\nWait a second, perhaps the formula is for the entire expression, not just the layers. Let me think again. The problem is E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with nine layers. So, perhaps E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) where the innermost is 1+3=4, and each layer adds another 1 +3*(...). So, with nine layers, perhaps E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +...+3*(1+3)))) with nine (1+3) terms.\n\nWait, but in our step-by-step calculation, we computed up to L1=3*9841=29523, which is the outermost layer. But according to the formula, E=3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 )=88572, which is much larger. So, perhaps the formula is not applicable here because the problem is finite with nine layers, whereas the formula is for an infinite series.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the formula I used is for an infinite geometric series, but here we have a finite number of layers, so the formula doesn't apply directly. Therefore, the step-by-step calculation is the accurate way to go, giving us 29523 as the result.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have nine layers, each defined as f(k)=1 +3*f(k+1), starting from f(9)=4, then f(8)=1 +3*4=13, f(7)=1 +3*13=40, and so on, up to f(1)=1 +3*f(2). Then, the outermost expression is 3*f(1). Wait, that would be different. Because in this case, the outermost layer is 3*f(1), not 3*f(9). So, perhaps I was miscounting the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify: if the innermost layer is f(9)=4, then f(8)=1 +3*f(9)=13, f(7)=1 +3*f(8)=40, and so on, up to f(1)=1 +3*f(2). Then, the outermost expression is 3*f(1). So, in this case, f(1) would be the value just inside the outermost 3, and then the entire expression is 3*f(1).\n\nWait, but in our earlier step-by-step, we computed L1=3*L2=29523, which would correspond to 3*f(2). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the indexing.\n\nWait, let's try to reindex. Let me define f(k) as the value starting from the outermost layer. So, f(1)=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...)))), where the innermost is 1+3=4. So, f(1)=3*(1 +3*f(2)), where f(2)=1 +3*f(3), and so on, until f(9)=1 +3*4=13, and f(10)=4. Wait, that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the problem as having nine layers of 1+3(...), so the entire expression inside the outermost 3 is (1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with nine layers. So, let me denote E as the entire expression, which is 3*(inner expression). The inner expression is 1 +3*(another inner expression), and so on, for nine layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))$ with nine (1+3) terms. So, each layer adds another 1 +3*(...), so the number of multiplications by 3 corresponds to the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the value can be expressed as E=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))$.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let me consider that each layer is 1 +3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, each previous layer is 1 +3*next_layer. So, with nine layers, the outermost layer would be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with eight layers inside.\n\nWait, but this is getting too convoluted. Since the step-by-step calculation gave me 29523, and each step checks out, perhaps that's the correct answer, and the formula approach might not be the right way to go here, or I might be misapplying it.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each calculation, I conclude that the value of the expression is 29523.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Outermost layer: 3*9841 = 29523\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{29523}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, let me write this out more clearly. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine layers of parentheses here, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, maybe the best approach is to start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let's count how many layers there are. Starting from the left, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Yep, nine layers. So, I'll need to compute each layer starting from the innermost one, which is the last one: 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent layer will build on that.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Let's assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost. So, layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(result from layer 1), and so on, up to layer 9, which is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3 times the result from layer 9. Hmm, that makes sense. So, I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write this down step by step:\n\n1. Compute layer 1: 1 + 3\n2. Use that result to compute layer 2: 1 + 3*(result from layer 1)\n3. Use layer 2's result for layer 3: 1 + 3*(result from layer 2)\n4. Continue this process until I get to layer 9\n5. Finally, multiply the result from layer 9 by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nAlright, let's get started.\n\n**Layer 1:** 1 + 3  \nThat's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, layer 1 result is 4.\n\n**Layer 2:** 1 + 3*(layer 1 result)  \nPlugging in layer 1's result, that's 1 + 3*4.  \n3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13.  \nLayer 2 result: 13.\n\n**Layer 3:** 1 + 3*(layer 2 result)  \nSo, 1 + 3*13.  \n3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.  \nLayer 3 result: 40.\n\n**Layer 4:** 1 + 3*(layer 3 result)  \n1 + 3*40.  \n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.  \nLayer 4 result: 121.\n\n**Layer 5:** 1 + 3*(layer 4 result)  \n1 + 3*121.  \n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.  \nLayer 5 result: 364.\n\n**Layer 6:** 1 + 3*(layer 5 result)  \n1 + 3*364.  \n3*364: Let me calculate that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092.  \nThen, 1 + 1092 is 1093.  \nLayer 6 result: 1093.\n\n**Layer 7:** 1 + 3*(layer 6 result)  \n1 + 3*1093.  \nCalculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279.  \nThen, 1 + 3279 is 3280.  \nLayer 7 result: 3280.\n\n**Layer 8:** 1 + 3*(layer 7 result)  \n1 + 3*3280.  \nCalculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840.  \nThen, 1 + 9840 is 9841.  \nLayer 8 result: 9841.\n\n**Layer 9:** 1 + 3*(layer 8 result)  \n1 + 3*9841.  \nCalculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.  \nThen, 1 + 29523 is 29524.  \nLayer 9 result: 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times the result from layer 9. So, we have:\n\n3 * (layer 9 result) = 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3. \n\nBreaking it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Now, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems like a big number, but considering how many layers there are, it might make sense. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from layer 1:\n\n1: 1 + 3 = 4  \n2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \n3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \n4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \n5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \n6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \n7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \n8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \n9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \nFinal step: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that all seems to add up. Each step seems correct when I check it. So, I think my calculations are right. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the result of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. \n\nGiven that, I can model this as a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's see if we can find A and B.\n\nSo, for n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4  \nFor n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13  \nSubtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nThen, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = (-1)/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, that's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for the layers I've already computed.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.  \nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.  \nFor n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.  \nFor n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.  \nFor n=5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.  \nFor n=6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.  \nFor n=7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.  \nFor n=8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.  \nFor n=9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, the formula works for all the layers. So, using this formula, the result for layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can express the entire original expression using the formula. Since the outermost layer is 3*(a_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ). Let's compute that:\n\n3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final answer: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, especially in the multiplication steps, I can cross-verify a couple of layers.\n\nFor example, layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. 1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. 1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000+840=9840. 1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. 1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nAnd finally, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:  \n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.  \n2*3=6 +1=7.  \n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.  \n2*3=6 +1=7.  \n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.  \n2*3=6 +2=8.  \nSo, reading it backwards, 88572. Wait, that seems off. Let me compute it properly.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.  \n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.  \n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.  \n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7.  \n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.  \n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.  \nNo more digits, so write down the carry over 0? Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so after the 2 (from 9*3), there's no more digits, so we just have 8. So, putting it together: 8 (from the carry over), 7, 7, 5, 2. So, 87752? Wait, that doesn't match my earlier result.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the digit positions. Let me write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4  \n   x         3  \n   ------------  \n     ?\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4*3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, no carry.\n\nNext digit: 5*3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8, no carry.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 7 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 87572? Hmm, that's different from what I had before. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000  \n9000 * 3 = 27000  \n500 * 3 = 1500  \n20 * 3 = 60  \n4 * 3 = 12  \nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000  \n87000 + 1500 = 88500  \n88500 + 60 = 88560  \n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nAh, okay, so the correct result is 88572, not 87572. So, when I did the multiplication digit by digit earlier, I must have miscounted the digits. Probably, I didn't account for the carry-over properly beyond the thousands place. So, the correct result is indeed 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me verify 29524 * 3 once more:\n\n29524  \nx    3  \n-------  \nMultiply each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12  \n2 * 3 = 6  \n5 * 3 = 15  \n9 * 3 = 27  \n2 * 3 = 6  \nNow, writing them down with proper alignment:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4  \n   x         3  \n   ------------  \n       1 2  (from 4*3)  \n         7   (from 2*3 + 1)  \n       5    (from 5*3 + 0)  \n     8 7    (from 9*3 + 2)  \n   8      (from 2*3 + 0)  \n   ------------------  \n   8 8 5 7 2  \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, when you multiply, you have to add the carries as you go. Let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5*3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that's 88572. Because the first digit we write is the units place, then tens, hundreds, etc.\n\nSo, starting from the right:\n\nFirst digit (units place): 2  \nSecond digit (tens place): 7  \nThird digit (hundreds place): 5  \nFourth digit (thousands place): 8  \nFifth digit (ten-thousands place): 8\n\nSo, reading left to right: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. I must have misaligned the digits earlier when I thought it was 87572. So, the correct result is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying my calculations, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result from Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start from the innermost part. The innermost expression is 1+3. That seems straightforward. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(innermost result). Since the innermost result is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level out is 13.\n\nMoving out another level, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, now we're at 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next level would be 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, moving on, the next one is 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, and adding 1 gives 364. \n\nNext, we go another level out: 1 + 3*364. Let me do that: 3*364 is... well, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so adding those together, 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280.\n\nMoving out another level, we have 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so adding those together gives 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841.\n\nNow, the next expression is 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. Breaking it down, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524.\n\nNext level out: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524... Hmm, 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Wait, maybe a better way is to just compute 3*29524 directly. Let me do that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. So, 29524*3 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573.\n\nMoving out another level, we have 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute that. 3*88573. Let's break it down: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that because that seems like a big number. So, 88573 * 3: 3*8 is 24, 3*8 is 24, 3*5 is 15, 3*7 is 21, 3*3 is 9. But actually, it's 88,573. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- 3*3 = 9\n- 3*7 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n- 3*5 = 15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1\n- 3*8 = 24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n- 3*8 = 24, plus 2 is 26, write down 6, carry over 2\n- But wait, there's no more digits, so we have 2 left, which would be 2 in the next higher place, but actually, 88,573 is a 5-digit number, so the multiplication would be:\n\n88,573\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n265,719\n\nYes, that's correct. So, adding 1 gives 265,720.\n\nNow, the next expression is 1 + 3*265,720. Let me compute that. 3*265,720. Let's compute that: 200,000*3 is 600,000, 60,000*3 is 180,000, 5,000*3 is 15,000, 700*3 is 2,100, and 20*3 is 60. Adding those together: 600,000 + 180,000 is 780,000, plus 15,000 is 795,000, plus 2,100 is 797,100, plus 60 is 797,160. Then, adding 1 gives 797,161.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. 265,720 * 3: 200,000*3 is 600,000, 60,000*3 is 180,000, 5,000*3 is 15,000, 700*3 is 2,100, 20*3 is 60. So, 600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000; 780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000; 795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100; 797,100 + 60 = 797,160. Then, adding 1 gives 797,161. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost level, the expression is 1 + 3*797,161. Let me compute that. 3*797,161. Let me break it down: 700,000*3 is 2,100,000, 90,000*3 is 270,000, 7,000*3 is 21,000, 100*3 is 300, 60*3 is 180, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 2,100,000 + 270,000 is 2,370,000; 2,370,000 + 21,000 is 2,391,000; 2,391,000 + 300 is 2,391,300; 2,391,300 + 180 is 2,391,480; 2,391,480 + 3 is 2,391,483. Then, adding 1 gives 2,391,484.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 797,161 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- 1*3 = 3\n- 6*3 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1\n- 1*3 = 3, plus 1 is 4\n- 7*3 = 21, write down 1, carry over 2\n- 9*3 = 27, plus 2 is 29, write down 9, carry over 2\n- 7*3 = 21, plus 2 is 23, write down 3, carry over 2\n- 9*3 = 27, plus 2 is 29, write down 9, carry over 2\n- 7*3 = 21, plus 2 is 23, write down 3, carry over 2\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to just compute it step by step:\n\n797,161\n\u00d7        3\n----------\n2,391,483\n\nYes, that's correct because 700,000*3 is 2,100,000; 90,000*3 is 270,000; 7,000*3 is 21,000; 100*3 is 300; 60*3 is 180; 1*3 is 3. Adding them up as before gives 2,391,483. Then, adding 1 gives 2,391,484.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3 times that result. So, the outermost multiplication is 3*(2,391,484). Let me compute that. 2,391,484 * 3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- 2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000\n- 300,000 * 3 = 900,000\n- 90,000 * 3 = 270,000\n- 1,000 * 3 = 3,000\n- 400 * 3 = 1,200\n- 80 * 3 = 240\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n6,000,000 + 900,000 = 6,900,000\n\n6,900,000 + 270,000 = 7,170,000\n\n7,170,000 + 3,000 = 7,173,000\n\n7,173,000 + 1,200 = 7,174,200\n\n7,174,200 + 240 = 7,174,440\n\n7,174,440 + 12 = 7,174,452\n\nSo, 3 * 2,391,484 equals 7,174,452.\n\nWait, let me verify that with another method to be sure. Let's compute 2,391,484 * 3 digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n- 8 * 3 = 24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n- 4 * 3 = 12, plus 2 is 14, write down 4, carry over 1\n- 1 * 3 = 3, plus 1 is 4\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2\n- 7 * 3 = 21, plus 2 is 23, write down 3, carry over 2\n- 3 * 3 = 9, plus 2 is 11, write down 1, carry over 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7\n\nPutting it all together: 7,174,452.\n\nYes, that matches. So, the final result is 7,174,452.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. Starting from the innermost, I computed each level step by step, moving outward each time, and each time I added 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Then, once I reached the outermost parentheses, I multiplied that by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 265720\n12. Next: 1 + 3*265720 = 797161\n13. Next: 1 + 3*797161 = 2391484\n14. Finally: 3*2391484 = 7174452\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step built upon the previous one, and I carefully computed each multiplication and addition. I also double-checked some of the larger multiplications to ensure I didn't make any mistakes, especially with the bigger numbers. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 7,174,452.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{7174452}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Let me note that down.\n\n2. The next layer out would be 1 + 3 times the previous result. Wait, let me make sure I understand the structure. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n- Let's define each layer as follows:\n  - Layer 1: 1 + 3\n  - Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n  - Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n  - And so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count how many layers there are. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and since there are nine sets of parentheses, that means there are nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I look at the problem, it's written as 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There's one after each 3, so let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nEach time, there's a 1 + 3*(...), so each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count how many times this happens. The innermost part is 1+3, then each step adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost 1+3, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...), so the number of layers is 9, because each layer is a new 1+3*(...), starting from the innermost. So, I think the expression can be broken down into 9 layers. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the Layer 9 expression.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), and so on, up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, after computing Layer9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nWait, but wait, let me confirm that I have 9 layers correctly. Let me count the number of times I have \"1 + 3(\" in the expression. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer.

Let me count:\n\nAfter the first 3, there's 1+3(...), then inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on. How many times does this happen? Let me see:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. The innermost is 1+3, so that's Layer1: 1+3\n3. Then each step adds a new 1+3*(...), so up to Layer9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time after the 3, there's an opening parenthesis, which starts a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first opening parenthesis after the initial 3 is at the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis until the last one, which is 1+3).\n\nWait, maybe I should count how many times the pattern \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nEach time, a new 1 + 3*(...) is added. So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 3*(1+3*(...) occurrences.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer. So, the first opening parenthesis after the initial 3 is at the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis until the innermost one, which doesn't have an opening parenthesis after it because it's 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see how many times the pattern \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me try to count:\n\n- The first \"1+3(\" is after the initial 3, so that's Layer1: 1+3\n- Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\" for Layer2\n- Continuing, Layer3, Layer4, up to Layer9.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as having 9 layers because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and the expression has 9 sets of \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences, let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after a 3, there's a \"1+3(\", starting from the first 3, and each subsequent 3 inside adds another \"1+3(\" until the innermost one, which is just 1+3 without another \"1+3(\".\n\nSo, how many \"1+3(\" are there? Let's see:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...\n2. The next 3 inside is followed by another (1+3(...\n3. This continues until the last 3, which is followed by (1+3), and then it ends.\n\nSo, the number of \"1+3(\" is equal to the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that each \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer. Let me count how many times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n- The first \"1+3(\" is after the initial 3.\n- Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\".\n- This continues until the innermost \"1+3\".\n\nSo, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. Then inside, 3(1+3(...\n3. Repeating this, how many times?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression after the initial 3 is:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new opening parenthesis. Let's count the number of opening parentheses in this part:\n\n- The first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3: 1\n- Then, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the structure as:\n\nEach time, the expression is 1 + 3*(...), where the ... is another similar expression. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost layer, which is 1+3, then each layer wraps around it with another 1 + 3*(...).\n\nSo, if I have n layers, then the expression is built as follows:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer9, which would be the outermost layer before multiplying by the initial 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier up to Layer9, I got 29524, and then I thought to multiply by 3, but perhaps that's incorrect because the expression is 3*(Layer9). So, if Layer9 is 29524, then 3*29524 would be the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me verify the number of layers again. Let's see: starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression:\n\n1. After the initial 3, the first \"1+3(\" starts the first layer.\n2. Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\" starts the second layer.\n3. This continues until the innermost \"1+3(\", which is the ninth layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me write the expression again:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" introduces a new opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n- The first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3: 1\n- Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\": 2\n- And so on, until the innermost \"1+3\": which would be the ninth opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, after the initial 3, the first \"1+3(\" is at position 1, then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another. So, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9, meaning there are 9 layers.\n\nSo, that means I have 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer1 as 1+3=4, then Layer2=1+3*4=13, Layer3=1+3*13=40, and so on up to Layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to Layer9 as 29524, and then I thought to multiply by 3. So, 3*29524 would be the answer. Let me compute that.\n\nBut before that, let me make sure I computed each layer correctly. Let me go through each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, Layer9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524.\n\nSo, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 90000 - 1428.\n\nWait, 90000 - 1000 = 89000\n\n89000 - 428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer would be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" after a 3 introduces a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each time after a 3, there's a \"1+3(\", except for the last one, which is just 1+3.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur?\n\nLet me count each occurrence:\n\n1. After the first 3: 1+3(\n2. Then, inside that, another 3 is followed by 1+3(\n3. This continues until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, each \"1+3(\" introduces a new opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n- The first one after 3: 1\n- Then, inside that, another \"1+3(\": 2\n- Continue until the innermost, which is 1+3 without another parenthesis.\n\nSo, how many opening parentheses after the initial 3? Let me see:\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds an opening parenthesis, so the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is equal to the number of layers.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the innermost part is 1+3, so that's Layer1:1+3=4.\n\nThen, each layer wraps around the previous one with 1+3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, starting from Layer1, we have 9 layers because the expression has 9 sets of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences.\n\nWait, let me try to count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nStarting from the initial 3, the first \"1+3(\" is at the first 3, then each subsequent \"1+3(\" is inside the previous one.\n\nSo, how many times does \"1+3(\" appear? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(1+3(\n3. Repeating until the innermost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because each \"1+3(\" is added 9 times.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to consider that each time we have a \"1+3(\", it's a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression, I can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 \"1+3(\" occurrences before reaching the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, let me try to write it out:\n\n- Layer1: 1+3\n- Layer2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n- Layer3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n- ...\n- Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. Therefore, my computation of 9 layers is correct, leading to Layer9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my computations for each layer again, just to be sure.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer is computed correctly.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the initial expression is 3*(...), where ... is Layer9. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think: this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a geometric series.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches my earlier computation of Layer9 as 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the expression is 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the linear recurrence.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " That makes sense because in order to solve expressions with parentheses, you always start from the innermost one and work your way out.\n\nAlright, so let's try to parse this step by step. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by a big parentheses. Inside that parentheses, it's 1 plus 3 times another parentheses. And this pattern continues all the way down. So, maybe if I can compute each inner expression first, I can build up the solution from the inside out.\n\nLet me write down the structure to visualize it better. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here, each with a 1 plus 3 times another parentheses. So, starting from the innermost one, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me start calculating from there.\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, starting from the innermost. So Level 1 is (1 + 3), Level 2 is 1 + 3*(Level 1), Level 3 is 1 + 3*(Level 2), and so on until Level 9. Then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). That seems manageable.\n\nSo, let's compute each level step by step.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nSo Level 2 is 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute 3*13: 3*13 = 39\n\nThen add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 3 is 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, then 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121\n\n3*121 is 363, then 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\n3*364: Let me compute that. 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092\n\nThen add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093\n\nLevel 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093. Let's see, 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279\n\nThen add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280\n\nLevel 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840\n\nThen add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841\n\nLevel 8 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841. Let me break this down: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Now add them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 123 = 29523.\n\nThen add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524\n\nLevel 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nCompute that: 3*29524. Let me compute 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I did each step correctly. It's easy to make a mistake when dealing with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. Let me verify each level again.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again: 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so 900+192=1092. Then 1092 +1=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 41*3=123. 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*29524: Let's break it down again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Now, 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 +1500=88500, 88500 +72=88572. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each step checks out. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down level by level made it manageable. Each level is just a small computation, and once I did each one step by step, it all came together.\n\nI guess another way to think about this is that each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). So, if I define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from 4, then each subsequent term is built from the previous one. This recursive structure might have a pattern or formula that could be generalized, but since there are only nine levels, it's faster to compute each one manually.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find a formula for this kind of nested expression, it might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that for a moment. Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote the nth term as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since I only need the 9th term, computing each step is manageable.\n\nBut just for fun, let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nThis confirms the earlier step-by-step computation. So, whether I compute each level manually or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me even more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly. The key was recognizing the recursive structure and either computing each level step by step or finding a closed-form formula. Both methods led me to the same conclusion, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start by looking at the innermost part of the expression. The innermost part is 1+3, right? Because each time, the expression is 1 plus 3 times something. So, starting from the inside, I can compute each layer one by one. Let me write this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the innermost expression is 1+3. That's simple: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost parentheses is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so the next layer out is 13. \n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, that's 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: 3 times 13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, the next layer is 40. \n\nContinuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). Let me calculate that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that layer is 121. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121). Hmm, 3 times 121 is... let's see, 120 times 3 is 360, and 1 times 3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, adding 1 gives 364. So, that's 364. \n\nMoving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(364). Let me compute 3 times 364. 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, that's 1093. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's calculate 3 times 1093. 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, that layer is 3280. \n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3 times 3280. 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, and 80 times 3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives 9841. So, that layer is 9841. \n\nWait, hold on, I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me check my calculations again. When I calculated 3 times 3280, I broke it down as 3000 + 200 + 80, which is correct, but let me verify each multiplication. \n\n3000 * 3 = 9000, that's correct. 200 * 3 = 600, that's right. 80 * 3 = 240, yes. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is indeed 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 is 9841. Okay, that seems correct. \n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3 times 9841. Hmm, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 800 * 3 = 2400, 40 * 3 = 120, and 1 * 3 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, that layer is 29524. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check that multiplication. 3 times 9841: 9000 * 3 is 27000, 800 * 3 is 2400, 40 * 3 is 120, and 1 * 3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is indeed 29400. Then, 29400 + 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. That seems correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3 times 29524. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives 88573. So, that layer is 88573. \n\nWait, hold on, I think I messed up the breakdown. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000 * 3 is 60000, 9000 * 3 is 27000, 500 * 3 is 1500, 20 * 3 is 60, and 4 * 3 is 12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Then, 88572 + 1 = 88573. Yes, that's correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute 3 times 88573. Hmm, 80000 * 3 = 240000, 8000 * 3 = 24000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 70 * 3 = 210, and 3 * 3 = 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720. So, that layer is 265720. \n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again. 88573 * 3: 80000 * 3 is 240000, 8000 * 3 is 24000, 500 * 3 is 1500, 70 * 3 is 210, and 3 * 3 is 9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 265719 + 1 is 265720. That seems correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(265720). Let's compute 3 times 265720. 200000 * 3 = 600000, 60000 * 3 = 180000, 5000 * 3 = 15000, 700 * 3 = 2100, 20 * 3 = 60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161. So, that layer is 797161. \n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. 265720 * 3: 200000 * 3 = 600000, 60000 * 3 = 180000, 5000 * 3 = 15000, 700 * 3 = 2100, 20 * 3 = 60. So, 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, adding 1 gives 797161. Correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(797161). Let's compute 3 times 797161. Hmm, 700000 * 3 = 2100000, 90000 * 3 = 270000, 7000 * 3 = 21000, 100 * 3 = 300, 60 * 3 = 180, and 1 * 3 = 3. Adding those together: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. Then, adding 1 gives 2391484. So, that layer is 2391484. \n\nWait, let me check that again. 797161 * 3: 700000 * 3 is 2100000, 90000 * 3 is 270000, 7000 * 3 is 21000, 100 * 3 is 300, 60 * 3 is 180, and 1 * 3 is 3. So, 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. Then, adding 1 gives 2391484. That seems correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(2391484). Let's compute 3 times 2391484. Hmm, 2000000 * 3 = 6000000, 300000 * 3 = 900000, 90000 * 3 = 270000, 1000 * 3 = 3000, 400 * 3 = 1200, 80 * 3 = 240, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those together: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, plus 270000 is 7170000, plus 3000 is 7173000, plus 1200 is 7174200, plus 240 is 7174440, plus 12 is 7174452. Then, adding 1 gives 7174453. So, that layer is 7174453. \n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication. 2391484 * 3: 2000000 * 3 = 6000000, 300000 * 3 = 900000, 90000 * 3 = 270000, 1000 * 3 = 3000, 400 * 3 = 1200, 80 * 3 = 240, 4 * 3 = 12.

Wait, actually, 681361333 is 600000000 + 80000000 + 10000000 + 3000000 + 600000 + 100000 + 30000 + 3000 + 300 + 30 + 3. Let me compute each part:\n\n600000000 * 3 = 1800000000  \n80000000 * 3 = 240000000  \n10000000 * 3 = 30000000  \n3000000 * 3 = 9000000  \n600000 * 3 = 1800000  \n100000 * 3 = 300000  \n30000 * 3 = 90000  \n3000 * 3 = 9000  \n300 * 3 = 900  \n30 * 3 = 90  \n3 * 3 = 9  \n\nAdding them all together:  \n1800000000 + 240000000 = 2040000000  \n2040000000 + 30000000 = 2070000000  \n2070000000 + 9000000 = 2079000000  \n2079000000 + 1800000 = 2080800000  \n2080800000 + 300000 = 2081100000  \n2081100000 + 90000 = 2081190000  \n2081190000 + 9000 = 2081199000  \n2081199000 + 900 = 2081200900  \n2081200900 + 90 = 2081200990  \n2081200990 + 9 = 2081200999  \n\nThen, adding 1 gives 2081201000. So, that layer is 2081201000. \n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication. 681361333 * 3: 600000000 * 3 = 1800000000, 80000000 * 3 = 240000000, 10000000 * 3 = 30000000, 3000000 * 3 = 9000000, 600000 * 3 = 1800000, 100000 * 3 = 300000, 30000 * 3 = 90000, 3000 * 3 = 9000, 300 * 3 = 900, 30 * 3 = 90, 3 * 3 = 9. Adding them up: 1800000000 + 240000000 = 2040000000, plus 30000000 is 2070000000, plus 9000000 is 2079000000, plus 1800000 is 2080800000, plus 300000 is 2081100000, plus 90000 is 2081190000, plus 9000 is 2081199000, plus 900 is 2081200900, plus 90 is 2081200990, plus 9 is 2081200999. Then, adding 1 gives 2081201000. Correct. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(2081201000). Let's compute 3 times 2081201000. 2000000000 * 3 = 6000000000, 80000000 * 3 = 240000000, 1000000 * 3 = 3000000, 20000 * 3 = 60000, 1000 * 3 = 3000. Wait, actually, 2081201000 is 2000000000 + 80000000 + 1000000 + 20000 + 1000. Let me compute each part:\n\n2000000000 * 3 = 6000000000  \n80000000 * 3 = 240000000  \n1000000 * 3 = 3000000  \n20000 * 3 = 60000  \n1000 * 3 = 3000  \n\nAdding them together:  \n6000000000 + 240000000 = 6240000000  \n6240000000 + 3000000 = 6243000000  \n6243000000 + 60000 = 6243060000  \n6243060000 + 3000 = 62430630"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me rewrite the expression to see if I can visualize it better. The innermost part is $1+3$, right? So let me compute that first. $1 + 3$ is 4. So, the next layer out is $1 + 3(4)$. Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, so $1 + 12$ is 13. Hmm, okay, so that layer becomes 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's $1 + 3(13)$. Let me compute 3 times 13, which is 39, and then add 1 to get 40. So, this layer is 40. Next layer out is $1 + 3(40)$. 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, interesting. So, that's 121.\n\nContinuing this way, the next layer would be $1 + 3(121)$. Let me calculate 3 times 121. 3 times 120 is 360, and 3 times 1 is 3, so 360 + 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives me 364. So, this layer is 364.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's $1 + 3(364)$. Let me compute 3 times 364. Well, 3 times 300 is 900, 3 times 60 is 180, and 3 times 4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nNext layer out is $1 + 3(1093)$. Let me compute 3 times 1093. 3 times 1000 is 3000, 3 times 90 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. So, that's 3280.\n\nContinuing, the next layer is $1 + 3(3280)$. Let me compute 3 times 3280. 3 times 3000 is 9000, 3 times 200 is 600, and 3 times 80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's $1 + 3(9841)$. Let me compute 3 times 9841. Hmm, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 800 is 2400, 3 times 40 is 120, and 3 times 1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, that's 29524.\n\nNext layer out is $1 + 3(29524)$. Let me compute 3 times 29524. 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, that's 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is $3(88573)$. Let me compute that. 3 times 80000 is 240000, 3 times 8000 is 24000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 70 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, the final result is 265719.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a very large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 1 + 3(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. 3(88573) = 265719\n\nHmm, each step seems correct. Each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1, except for the very last step where I just multiplied by 3. So, yes, it seems like 265719 is the correct result.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or perhaps find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a more efficient way to compute this without expanding each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the structure, each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I denote the innermost term as a base case and build up, it's similar to a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\na_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I got earlier. Therefore, I can be confident that 265719 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see, each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 4 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=10, a_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, a_10 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573, which matches the earlier result.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719.\n\nSo, using the closed-form solution, I also arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that 265719 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nLooking at the structure, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)).\n\nIf I denote the innermost term as 1 + 3, which is 4, then each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which is similar to a geometric progression but with a constant term added each time.\n\nIn any case, since I've verified it both by expanding each layer step by step and by finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations, I'm pretty confident that the answer is 265719.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors because each step checks out, and the closed-form solution aligns with the step-by-step expansion. So, yeah, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{265719}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost part:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6.

Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\n10. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n    \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 \\]\n\n11. Finally, compute the outermost layer:\n    \\[ 3 \\times 88573 = 265719 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{265719}\\)."

    "text": " That makes sense because with nested parentheses, you always work from the innermost out.\n\nSo, let's start by identifying how many layers there are. Each time I see a \"1+3(...)\", that's a layer. Let me count them: starting from the innermost, there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine layers. So, nine layers in total. That means I need to work from the innermost layer, which is the last \"1+3\", and work my way outwards, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, I can compute each part as I go. So, the innermost part is \"1+3\". Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so the innermost parentheses evaluate to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is \"1 + 3*(result from innermost layer)\". So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so that layer gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is \"1 + 3*(result from the second layer)\", which is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, that's 40. Okay, moving out another layer, the next expression is \"1 + 3*(result from the third layer)\", which is 1 + 3*(40). Let me calculate that.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWow, that's getting big quickly. So, 121 is the result for the fourth layer. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is \"1 + 3*(121)\". Let me compute that.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nOkay, 364. That's a pretty large number. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is \"1 + 3*(364)\". Let me compute that.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWow, 1093. That's getting really big. Next layer out is \"1 + 3*(1093)\". Let me calculate that.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nHmm, 3280. That's a four-digit number now. Moving out another layer, the next expression is \"1 + 3*(3280)\". Let me compute that.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWhoa, 9841. That's a five-digit number. Now, the next layer out is \"1 + 3*(9841)\". Let me compute that.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nAlright, so the innermost parentheses worked their way out to 29524. But wait, the original problem is 3 times this entire expression. So, after computing the innermost parentheses and working out to the ninth layer, I got 29524, but that's just the inner part. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by that result. So, I need to compute 3*(29524).\n\nLet me calculate that. 3*29524. Hmm, let's see. 29524 times 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Wait, 29524 is actually 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, no, that's not correct because 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 should be 88572. Let me check that with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8 7 7 5 7 2. Wait, no, wait, let's do it step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it out properly:\n\n     29524\n   x     3\n   --------\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the right, we have 2, then 7, then 5, then 7, then 7, then 8. Wait, that would be 877572? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 * 3 is 88572, not 877572. I think I messed up the placement of the digits.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try again.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, when I multiply by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2 (units), 7 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 8 (thousands), 8 (ten thousands). So, the number is 88572.\n\nWait, that's correct because 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial breakdown when I tried adding 60000 + 27000, etc. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I thought I had 877572, which is wrong because that would be a 6-digit number, but 29524 is only 5 digits, so 29524*3 should be 88572, which is 5 digits. So, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method earlier.\n\nSo, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3 using another approach.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet me break it down as (30000 - 476) * 3.\n\nSo, 30000 * 3 = 90000.\n\n476 * 3 = 1428.\n\nSo, 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the inner layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing the expression using another approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nWait, the expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost term.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, the ninth term is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's see if this sequence follows a pattern.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\na_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 13.\n\na_3 = 40.\n\na_4 = 121.\n\na_5 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 29524.\n\nI can try to see if there's a recurrence relation here. Each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p.\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it directly without going through each layer. That's much faster, especially if there are more layers. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, it's manageable either way.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, I arrived at the result 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe result of the innermost expression is 29524. We then multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " That makes sense because parentheses are evaluated from the inside out, right?\n\nAlright, so the innermost part of this expression is the last (1+3). Let me write this down step by step, starting from the inside and working my way out. I'll label each step so I don't get confused.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Let's compute the innermost expression first: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another 1 + 3 times that result. Let's write that down.\n\n2. Next, moving one level out, the expression becomes: 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result was 4, this is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level simplifies to 13.\n\n3. Now, moving another level out, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result. The previous result was 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that level simplifies to 40.\n\n4. Continuing this pattern, the next level out is 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: 3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that simplifies to 121.\n\n5. Moving another level out, we have 1 + 3*121. Let me calculate that: 3*121 is 363, and 1 + 363 is 364. So, that becomes 364.\n\n6. Next, the expression is 1 + 3*364. Let me do the multiplication first: 3*364. Hmm, 3 times 300 is 900, 3 times 60 is 180, and 3 times 4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives us 1093. So, that level simplifies to 1093.\n\n7. Moving another level out, the expression is 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Well, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives us 3280. So, that simplifies to 3280.\n\n8. Next level out, we have 1 + 3*3280. Calculating that: 3*3280. Let me break it down: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives us 9841. So, that becomes 9841.\n\n9. Now, moving another level out, the expression is 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives us 29524. So, that simplifies to 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost expression is 3 times the previous result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3 is 60,000, 9,000*3 is 27,000, 500*3 is 1,500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000, plus 1,500 is 88,500, plus 60 is 88,560, plus 12 is 88,572. So, 3*29524 equals 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, carry over 1; 2*3 is 6 plus 1 is 7; 5*3 is 15, carry over 1; 9*3 is 27 plus 1 is 28, carry over 2; 2*3 is 6 plus 2 is 8. So, writing it out: 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step simplifies as follows:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nSo, after computing each step carefully, I arrive at the final result of 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way. Each step seems to follow logically, and I rechecked the final multiplication, so I think this should be correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " \n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me write that down. (1+3) is equal to 4. Okay, so that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1+3 times that result. So, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. Got it, so that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, okay, so that's 40. \n\nContinuing this way, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. Alright, so that's 121. \n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. Okay, 364 it is. \n\nThen, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. Got that down. \n\nNext, 1 + 3*(1093). Let's see, 3*1093 is... well, 1000*3 is 3000, and 93*3 is 279, so adding those together, 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. \n\nContinuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*(3280). Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. \n\nAnother layer out: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. \n\nNext, moving out one more layer: 1 + 3*(29524). Let's calculate 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I counted the layers correctly. The original problem is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous result) +1. Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see: starting from the innermost (1+3), then each time we have another layer multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 times another parenthesis. Let me count the number of times this occurs. Starting from the innermost, each step is one layer. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around it. Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Let's see: 1+3(...), then another 1+3(...), etc. From the expression, I can see that starting from the innermost, each layer is one more 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, (1+3), then each time, it's 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9, because each time we have a new (1+3(...)). So, that would mean there are 9 layers. Wait, but when I started computing, I only went through 8 layers. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me write down the layers step by step. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so I think I initially stopped at Layer 9, which is 29524, but then I continued to compute beyond that, which might have been incorrect. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with how many layers? Let me parse the expression again. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost, we have (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3( before that. So, the number of 1+3(...) is 9, because each time you go out a layer, you add another 1+3(.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1+3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...). So, how many (1+3(...) are there? Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n10. Then, the innermost is (1+3).\n\nWait, but that's 9 layers after the initial 3. So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9. So, starting from the innermost (1+3) as Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, total layers would be 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then when I tried to go further, I thought I had more layers, but perhaps that was a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after Layer 9, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I went beyond Layer 9, but perhaps that was a mistake. So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and a new parenthesis. Let me count the number of \"1+\" terms. From the innermost, each layer adds another \"1+3(...\". So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each time we go out a layer, we add another \"1+3*(...)\", so that's 8 more layers, making it 9 layers total. So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that seems right. But let me confirm that I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication steps. Let me recompute 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had more layers, I went up to 3280 and beyond, but that must have been a miscalculation. So, to be precise, the expression has 9 layers, so after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time we have a \"1+3(\", how many times does that occur? Let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 1+3(1+3) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer 3\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer, which is 3*(...). So, each time we add another \"1+3(\", so the number of layers is 9. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted earlier. Let me try another approach. Let's write the expression step by step, expanding each layer.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let\u2019s say:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, each a_i is defined as 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a\u2081 = 4. Therefore, after 9 layers, a\u2089 is 29524, and the final result is 3*a\u2089 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in computing each a_i. Let me go through each step again.\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, all the a_i terms are correct. Then, the final step is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears in the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. 1+3(1+3) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) \u2192 Layer 4\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) \u2192 Layer 5\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u2192 Layer 6\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) \u2192 Layer 7\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) \u2192 Layer 8\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 Layer 9\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, there are 9 layers, each corresponding to a_i from 1 to 9. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step, writing down each a_i:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, yes, a\u2089 is 29524, and 3*a\u2089 is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each a_i using another method, perhaps iteratively, to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think.\n\nThe general form of such an expression is a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1 \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we arrive at the same result, which confirms that our step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(next term), starting from the innermost (1+3).\n\n2. **Expand each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Compute the final result**: Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. That's straightforward: 1 plus 3 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 plus 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me calculate that: 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nWait, so each time I go out a layer, I'm taking 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, the next layer out would be 1 + 3*(13). Let me do that: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Hmm, okay, so that's 40. \n\nContinuing this pattern, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Alright, moving on, the next layer is 1 + 3*(121). Calculating that: 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. \n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3*(364). Let me figure that out: 3 times 364 is... let's see, 360 times 3 is 1080, and 4 times 3 is 12, so 1080 + 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. \n\nProceeding further, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1093). Calculating 3 times 1093: 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9, so adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. \n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute 3 times 3280. 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240, and 0 times 3 is 0. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840, plus 0 is still 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. \n\nThe next layer is 1 + 3*(9841). Calculating 3 times 9841: Let's break it down. 9000 times 3 is 27,000, 800 times 3 is 2,400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400, plus 120 is 29,520, plus 3 is 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29,524. \n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(29,524). Let me compute 3 times 29,524. Breaking it down: 20,000 times 3 is 60,000, 9,000 times 3 is 27,000, 500 times 3 is 1,500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000, plus 1,500 is 88,500, plus 60 is 88,560, plus 12 is 88,572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88,573. \n\nThe next layer is 1 + 3*(88,573). Calculating 3 times 88,573: Let's do 80,000 times 3 is 240,000, 8,000 times 3 is 24,000, 500 times 3 is 1,500, 70 times 3 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240,000 + 24,000 is 264,000, plus 1,500 is 265,500, plus 210 is 265,710, plus 9 is 265,719. Then, adding 1 gives me 265,720. \n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(265,720). Let me compute 3 times 265,720. Breaking it down: 200,000 times 3 is 600,000, 60,000 times 3 is 180,000, 5,000 times 3 is 15,000, 700 times 3 is 2,100, and 20 times 3 is 60. Adding those together: 600,000 + 180,000 is 780,000, plus 15,000 is 795,000, plus 2,100 is 797,100, plus 60 is 797,160. Then, adding 1 gives me 797,161. \n\nWait a minute, I think I've gone too far. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Each time I worked out a layer, I was moving one step outward. So, starting from the innermost, which was (1+3), that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another step. So, if there are nine layers, I should have computed up to the ninth layer. Let me recount the steps I took:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3) = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29,524\n\nWait, so that's nine layers. So, the outermost expression is 3 times that result. So, after computing the ninth layer, which is 29,524, I then multiply that by 3. So, 3*(29,524) is 88,572, and then I add 1? Wait no, the outermost expression is 3*(...). Let me look back at the original problem.\n\nThe original problem is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). The innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds 1 + 3*(previous). So, after computing the ninth layer, which is 29,524, that is the result of the innermost expression. Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). But I think I went one step too far.\n\nWait, let me recount. The innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524.\n\nSo, the ninth layer is 29,524, which is the result of the innermost expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, 3*29,524 is 88,572. Then, is that the final result? Or is there another layer?\n\nWait, no. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is layer 1: 4. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, after layer 9, which is 29,524, that is the result of the innermost parentheses. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). So, 3*29,524 is 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I went beyond that, computing up to 797,161, which must be incorrect. I think I confused the number of layers. Let me clarify.\n\nThe original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Each set adds one more layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524.\n\nSo, after layer 9, that's the innermost expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, 3*29,524 is 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to make sure. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, the first parenthesis is after the first 3, then each subsequent parenthesis adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\n- 3(1+3(...) )\n\nInside that, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, yes, 9 layers in total. Therefore, after computing layer 9 as 29,524, the outermost expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to layer 9 as 29,524, then thought the final step was 3* that, which is 88,572. So, that should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. Let me verify each step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nYes, that looks correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers. So, yes, 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. Let me compute 3*29,524.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " \n\nSo, to approach this, I think I should start from the innermost part of the expression and work my way outwards, solving each layer one by one. Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nCounting the number of 3(...) parts, I can see that there are nine sets of 3(...) starting from the innermost one. So, it's like a chain of nine layers. Let me try to label each layer to make it easier to refer to them. I'll start from the innermost one as Layer 1 and work my way out to Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9.\n\nSo, each layer is of the form: 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems manageable. Let me compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, moving on to Layer 2:\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3:\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit bigger, but okay. Let me continue.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nHmm, that's jumping up quickly. Let's go on.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWow, that's a big number. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could make this easier instead of computing each layer manually. But for now, let's keep going and see if a pattern emerges.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, so Layer 9 is 29524. But the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9.\n\nSo, the total expression would be 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let me break this down. 30000 * 3 = 90000, but since it's 29524, which is 30000 - 476. So, 3*29524 = 3*(30000 - 476) = 90000 - 3*476.\n\nNow, 3*476: 400*3=1200, 70*3=210, 6*3=18. So, 1200 + 210 + 18 = 1428.\n\nTherefore, 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me verify each step because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each layer again to ensure that I didn't make any errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, each layer seems correct. So, the final multiplication by 3 is indeed 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used here to compute this without calculating each layer. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer manually. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which makes me confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about this expression. Let me consider the structure of the expression.\n\nIt's a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each time we multiply by 3 and add 1. That's similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is built upon the previous one.\n\nWait, let me think about that. If I consider the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series.\n\nBut actually, the closed-form formula I derived earlier is more straightforward. It gives me a direct computation without having to sum a series.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write this out, each layer is adding another power of 3, but with some coefficients.\n\nWait, let me try to express the entire computation as a sum.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*(3 + 1) + 1 = 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*(3^2 + 3 + 1) + 1 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nWait, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be the sum of a geometric series up to 3^{n} where n is the layer number.\n\nWait, for Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Let me check.\n\nWait, Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13\n\nBut 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13, yes, that's correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*13 + 1 = 39 + 1 = 40, which is equal to 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 + 1 = 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 40. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, but that sum would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly what I found earlier. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression E, which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, then E can be expressed as 3*(1 + E'), where E' is the expression with eight layers. But this seems recursive and might not be helpful unless I can find a closed-form.\n\nBut since I already have the closed-form for each layer, it's easier to compute Layer 9 and then multiply by 3.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that each time we add a layer, we're effectively multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. The formula I derived earlier is the sum of a geometric series, which is why it works here.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the value using the closed-form formula.\n\nFor n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nWait, another way to think about this is in terms of base 3 numbers. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, which is like shifting digits in base 3. But I'm not sure if that helps directly here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a tree, where each node branches into a multiplication by 3 and an addition of 1, but that might complicate things more.\n\nI think the method I used initially, computing each layer step by step, is the most straightforward, especially since it's only nine layers. It's manageable, and with each step being a simple multiplication and addition, it's not too time-consuming.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute the layers again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYep, that's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step method and the closed-form formula give me the same result.\n\nJust to wrap up, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the inside out, I found that the innermost layer was 4, and each subsequent layer built upon that, leading up to the ninth layer being 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to represent this expression using exponents or another mathematical notation that could simplify it even more, but I think the closed-form formula I used is pretty efficient. It's always good to see that different methods lead to the same answer, which helps confirm that the result is correct.\n\nIn summary, breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and computing each step carefully is a reliable strategy, even if it takes a bit of time. It's better to take it step by step than to try to compute everything at once and risk making a mistake.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, leading up to the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So, that simplifies the innermost parentheses to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 plus 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me calculate that: 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 plus 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 plus 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, that would be 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3 times 13 first. 3 times 10 is 30, and 3 times 3 is 9, so 30 + 9 is 39. Then, adding 1 gives me 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40.\n\nContinuing this process, the next layer is 1 + 3 times 40. Let me compute that. 3 times 40 is 120, and then 1 plus 120 is 121. So, that's 121.\n\nNext, the layer is 1 + 3 times 121. Hmm, 3 times 121... Let me do that step by step. 3 times 100 is 300, 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 1 is 3. So, adding those together: 300 + 60 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, adding 1 gives me 364. So, that layer is 364.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3 times 364. Let me compute 3 times 364. Breaking it down: 3 times 300 is 900, 3 times 60 is 180, and 3 times 4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives me 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nNext, the expression is 1 + 3 times 1093. Let me calculate 3 times 1093. 3 times 1000 is 3000, 3 times 90 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1 gives me 3280. So, that layer is 3280.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3 times 3280. Let me compute 3 times 3280. 3 times 3000 is 9000, 3 times 200 is 600, and 3 times 80 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, adding 1 gives me 9841. So, that's 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 + 3 times 9841. Let me compute 3 times 9841. Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Let me break it down: 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 800 is 2400, 3 times 40 is 120, and 3 times 1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29524. So, that layer is 29524.\n\nNow, the next layer is 1 + 3 times 29524. Let me compute 3 times 29524. Breaking it down: 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, adding 1 gives me 88573. So, that layer is 88573.\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So, it's 3 times 88573. Let me compute that. 3 times 80000 is 240000, 3 times 8000 is 24000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 70 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719.

So step 2 is 13. \n\nNext, step 3 is 1 + 3 times step 2. So that's 1 + 3*(13). 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Step 3 is 40. \n\nMoving on to step 4: 1 + 3 times step 3. So 1 + 3*(40). 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Step 4 is 121. \n\nStep 5 is 1 + 3 times step 4. That's 1 + 3*(121). 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Step 5 is 364. \n\nNow, step 6 is 1 + 3 times step 5. So 1 + 3*(364). 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Step 6 is 1093. \n\nMoving to step 7: 1 + 3 times step 6. That's 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3 times 1093. 1093 times 3 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Step 7 is 3280. \n\nStep 8 is 1 + 3 times step 7. So 1 + 3*(3280). 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Step 8 is 9841. \n\nFinally, step 9 is the outermost layer: 1 + 3 times step 8. So that's 1 + 3*(9841). Let me calculate 3 times 9841. Hmm, 9841 times 3. Let me break that down: 9000 times 3 is 27,000, 800 times 3 is 2,400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 is 29,400; 29,400 + 120 is 29,520; 29,520 + 3 is 29,523. So 3 times 9841 is 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives me 29,524. So step 9 is 29,524. \n\nBut wait, the original problem isn't just step 9; it's 3 times step 9. So I have to multiply the result of step 9 by 3. Let me do that: 3 times 29,524. Hmm, let's compute that. 29,524 times 3. Breaking it down again: 20,000 times 3 is 60,000; 9,000 times 3 is 27,000; 500 times 3 is 1,500; 20 times 3 is 60; and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 is 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 is 88,500; 88,500 + 60 is 88,560; 88,560 + 12 is 88,572. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 times 3. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n4 times 3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n5 times 3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n9 times 3 is 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 times 3 is 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\nNo more digits, so write down the carried over 2.\n\nWait, that gives me 88,572. So that seems correct. \n\nBut let me check step 9 again to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Step 9 is 1 + 3*(step 8). Step 8 was 9841, so 3*9841 is 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524. That seems right. Then, 3*29,524 is indeed 88,572. \n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The problem is 3 times the entire expression, which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So when I computed step 9 as 29,524, that was the innermost expression up to the ninth layer. But actually, the entire expression inside the outermost 3 is step 9, right? So I had to compute that and then multiply by 3. So 3*29,524 is 88,572. \n\nBut hold on, let me recount the steps to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me see: starting from the innermost, each time I added another layer. So the innermost was 1+3, then each subsequent step added another layer. So from step 1 to step 9, that's nine layers. So step 9 is indeed the entire expression inside the outermost 3. So I think I did it correctly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. \n\nIf I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, that might save me time instead of computing each step. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in this case, our recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So actually, the general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2, since c is 1 and r is 3. Wait, maybe I need to adjust that because the initial term is a_1 = 4, not a_0. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the recursion properly. Let me define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nTo solve this recurrence relation, we can use the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each step n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So 59,049 - 1 is 59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. That's exactly what I got earlier for step 9. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression inside the outermost 3 is 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29,524 = 88,572. \n\nWait, but let me confirm 3^10 is indeed 59,049. Let me compute 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. Yes, that's correct. So 59,049 - 1 is 59,048, divided by 2 is 29,524. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572. So the final answer should be 88,572. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me recompute 3*29,524. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\nNo more digits, so write down the carried over 2.\n\nWait, that gives me 88,572. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\nBreak it down as (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So I feel confident that 88,572 is the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this problem is to recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that. Since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), and this repeats 9 times, starting from 1+3. So, in terms of geometric series, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^9 - 1)/2 + something). Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nBut given that I've already solved it using both step-by-step computation and the recursive formula, and both methods gave me the same result, I think 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Use that result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Continue this process up to the ninth layer, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result)\n4. After nine layers, the result is 29,524\n5. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer: 88,572\n\nI think that covers all the steps and checks. I don't see any errors in my reasoning or calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the ninth layer, we get the result \\(29524\\). Finally, we multiply this result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " That makes sense because parentheses indicate that the operations inside should be done first.\n\nAlright, so let me start by writing down the expression again to visualize it better: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nHmm, that's nine sets of parentheses. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something. So maybe I can start solving from the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let me count the number of nested expressions. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the previous expression. Let me try to write each step separately.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me call the innermost expression as a base case and work my way out. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\na1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2\n\nAnd so on, up to a9, since there are nine layers. Then the entire expression is 3*a9. So, I need to compute a1 through a9 step by step.\n\nWait, let me confirm how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. And so on, up to nine times.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by a sum that starts at 1 plus 3 times another sum, and so on, nine times. So, perhaps each layer is one more step. Let me try to compute each a1 to a9 step by step.\n\nStarting with a1:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nSo, the entire expression equals 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did each step correctly because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic with so many steps.\n\nLet me go through each a1 to a9 again:\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\na3 =1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\na4=1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\na5=1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\na6=1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\na7=1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\na8=1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\na9=1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen 3*a9=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each step manually. Let me think about that.\n\nThis looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see.\n\nEach term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a1=4.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nWe have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume solution is a_n = C*3^n + D\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\nC*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D\n\nSubtract C*3^n from both sides:\n\nD = 1 + 3D\n\nSubtract 3D from both sides:\n\n-2D = 1 => D = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a1=4.\n\na1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for a9, it would be (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form expression, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2\n\nIn this case, n=9, so 3*a9 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=59049*3=177147\n\nSo, 3*a9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, that confirms that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me check 3^11 again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=59049*3: 59049*3=177147, yes.\n\nSo, 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nAlright, so that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression without using the closed-form by evaluating each layer step by step, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting again:\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13\n\nNext: 1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nNext:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nNext:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with the previous results.\n\nWait, maybe I can check one of the intermediate steps again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Let's check a7:\n\na6=1093\n\nSo, a7=1 +3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279\n\nThen, a7=1 +3279=3280, correct.\n\na8=1 +3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840\n\nThen, a8=1 +9840=9841, correct.\n\na9=1 +3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3, so 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523\n\nThen, a9=1 +29523=29524, correct.\n\nSo, 3*a9=29524*3=88572, correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nAnother way to approach this problem is to recognize the pattern as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nWait, but in this case, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation, not a geometric series, but the solution we found earlier was a geometric progression in terms of 3^n.\n\nSo, the closed-form expression using the recurrence relation gives the same result as computing each step manually, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I'm pretty sure that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident in this result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe define a sequence \\(a_n\\) where each term is built from the previous one:\n- \\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- \\(a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13\\)\n- \\(a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40\\)\n- \\(a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121\\)\n- \\(a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364\\)\n- \\(a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093\\)\n- \\(a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280\\)\n- \\(a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841\\)\n- \\(a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\(3 \\cdot a_9\\):\n- \\(3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me try to write this out more clearly. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's easy enough. Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4. \n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, so now that part simplifies to 13. So, moving another level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so that part is 40. Next, moving another level out, it's 1 + 3*(40). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, so now it's 121. Continuing this way, the next expression is 1 + 3*(121). Let's see:\n\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nOkay, so that's 364. Next, moving another level out, it's 1 + 3*(364). Let me calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nAlright, now we're at 1093. Moving another level out, the expression is 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that.\n\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nWait, so that's 3280. Next level out is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nHmm, that's 9841. Now, moving another level out, it's 1 + 3*(9841). Let me calculate that.\n\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nAlright, now we're at 29524. The next level out is 1 + 3*(29524). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nOkay, so that's 88573. Now, moving another level out, the expression is 1 + 3*(88573). Let me compute that.\n\n1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nWait, so that's 265720. Now, the outermost expression is 3 times that result. So, let me compute that.\n\n3*265720 = 797160.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, but maybe it's right. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct.\n\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720. Correct.\n\n12. Finally, 3*265720 = 797160. Correct.\n\nHmm, okay, so each step seems to be correct. So, the final result is 797,160. But wait, that seems really large, and I'm wondering if I miscounted the number of parentheses or if I missed a level. Let me check how many levels there are.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a level. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 levels. Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next: (1 + 3*(result))\n3. Then: (1 + 3*(result))\n...\nUp to 9 levels. Wait, so in my earlier steps, I went through 12 steps, which seems more than 9. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, perhaps the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step adds another layer. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nFrom the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), so how many times do we have this? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 adds a layer. So, the first layer is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers in total. So, my earlier calculation went through 9 layers, each time computing the next layer out. So, let's recount:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so after 9 layers, the result is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier result. So, I think I miscounted earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer.\n\nStarting from the initial 3, the first ( is at position 2, then each subsequent ( adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the initial 3, the first ( is at position 2, then another ( at position 5, then at position 8, and so on, until the last ( before the closing )))))).\n\nLet me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. ( at position 2: Layer 1\n2. ( at position 5: Layer 2\n3. ( at position 8: Layer 3\n4. ( at position 11: Layer 4\n5. ( at position 14: Layer 5\n6. ( at position 17: Layer 6\n7. ( at position 20: Layer 7\n8. ( at position 23: Layer 8\n9. ( at position 26: Layer 9\n\nSo, there are 9 layers in total. Therefore, after computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation where I thought I had 12 layers, which led me to 797,160. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering too many layers. It's actually 9 layers, so the final result is 88,572.\n\nLet me verify this again step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nNow, multiply by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had 9 layers, but when I first calculated, I went up to 3*(265720) which was 797,160. That was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. So, the correct number of layers is 9, leading to 88,572.\n\nTo make sure, let me try to compute it in another way. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without having to do each step manually.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => 0 = 1 + 2C => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had 12 layers, I got 797,160, which was incorrect. So, it's important to count the number of layers correctly. Let me just confirm the number of layers again.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach ( adds a new layer. Let's count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. ( at position 2: Layer 1\n2. ( at position 5: Layer 2\n3. ( at position 8: Layer 3\n4. ( at position 11: Layer 4\n5. ( at position 14: Layer 5\n6. ( at position 17: Layer 6\n7. ( at position 20: Layer 7\n8. ( at position 23: Layer 8\n9. ( at position 26: Layer 9\n\nSo, there are indeed 9 layers. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That makes sense because, in order of operations, we always solve the innermost parentheses first.\n\nSo, the expression is like a chain of operations starting from the inside. Let me try to write it out step by step, starting from the innermost part. The innermost part is the last one: 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That equals 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another expression: 1 + 3 times the result we just got. Let me write that down.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result). The previous result was 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12, then add 1. So, 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now we have 13 as the result for the second layer. Moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times the previous result.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first. 3 times 10 is 30, and 3 times 3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then add 1, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nSo now, the third layer gives us 40. Let me keep going. Next layer out:\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40. Compute 3*40 first. 3 times 40 is 120. Then add 1: 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nAlright, moving out another layer:\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. Hmm, 3 times 100 is 300, 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 1 is 3. So, 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then add 1: 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nContinuing outward:\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3 times 300 is 900, 3 times 60 is 180, and 3 times 4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nAnother layer out:\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3 times 1000 is 3000, 3 times 90 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. Let's see, 3 times 3000 is 9000, 3 times 200 is 600, 3 times 80 is 240. So, adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nWait, that seems a bit large, but I think it's correct. Let me double-check my calculations. 3 times 3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Yep, that seems right.\n\nContinuing outward, we have another layer:\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 800 is 2400, 3 times 40 is 120, and 3 times 1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, that's a pretty big number. Let me verify. 3 times 9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer:\n\n10. Next layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. Hmm, 3 times 20000 is 60000, 3 times 9000 is 27000, 3 times 500 is 1500, 3 times 20 is 60, and 3 times 4 is 12. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it step by step. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Then add 1: 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\nLet me check that again. 3*29524: 29524 *3. Let me compute it as (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3=87000, 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so 1500+72=1572. Then, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Then add 1: 88573. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer:\n\n11. Next layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573. Let's break it down: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Wait, no, 88573 is 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3. So, 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Now, adding all these together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, 265710 + 9 = 265719. Then add 1: 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\nWait, let me check that again because that seems quite large, but I think it's correct. 3*88573: Let me compute 88573*3. 88573*3: 3*80000=240000, 3*8000=24000, 3*500=1500, 3*70=210, 3*3=9. So, 240000 + 24000 = 264000, 264000 + 1500 = 265500, 265500 + 210 = 265710, 265710 + 9 = 265719. Then 265719 +1=265720. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the next layer:\n\n12.

    "text": " That makes sense because in order to evaluate parentheses, you start from the innermost one and work your way outwards. So, let me try to parse this step by step. \n\nAlright, the expression is $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. Let me count how many nested layers there are. Each time I see a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...), that's a layer. Starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), and then each layer wraps around that. Let me count: 1. Innermost: (1+3) 2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from 1) 3. Then another layer: 1 + 3*(result from 2) and so on, until the outermost layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me see: starting from the innermost, each time I add a layer, so from the innermost to the outermost, how many times does this happen? Let's see, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). Hmm, maybe a better approach is to see how many times 3 is multiplied by a term. Let me try to write it out, maybe with substitution. \n\nWait, maybe I can represent this as a recursive expression. Let me define each layer as a function. Let's say that each time, we have a term that is 1 plus 3 times the next term. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), let's compute that first. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from innermost). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from previous layer), and so on, until we get to the outermost layer. \n\nSo, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me assign each layer a number, starting from the innermost as layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9, since I think there are 9 layers here. Let me check: starting from the innermost (1+3), which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's see: the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3(...). Wait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with how many 1 + 3*(...) terms? Let me count the number of 1+3*(...) terms. Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...). Let me try to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). \n\nWait, maybe I can just start computing each layer one by one. Let me try that. So, layer 1 is the innermost (1+3). Let's compute that first. So, layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1 result). So, layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, layer 3 is 1 + 3*(layer 2 result) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(layer 9 result) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's see, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. So, the result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and I think there are 9 layers. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3*(...) appears. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(...). Each time there's a 3*(1 + ..., so each time, that's a new layer. Let me count them: starting from the first 3*(...), then inside that, another 3*(...), and so on. So, the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, each time we go out, that's a new layer. So, layer 1: (1+3) = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(29524) = 88572. \n\nWait, but let me confirm each step because it's easy to make a mistake in arithmetic. Let's go through each layer again. \n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct. \n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. \n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. \n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. \n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 121*3: 120*3=360, plus 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. \n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. \n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. \n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. \n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. \n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, 29524 is actually 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. So, 29524 * 3: \n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000*3 = 60,000\n\n9000*3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20*3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4*3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88,572. \n\nWait, but let me check that with another method to make sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 = 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3 = 27 +1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3 = 6 +2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88,572. Correct. \n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final result of 88,572. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers as I thought. Let me see: starting from the innermost (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each time we go out, that's a new layer. So, the number of layers is 9 because there are 9 sets of parentheses starting from the innermost. Let me confirm by writing out the layers:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer builds upon the previous one, and by computing each step carefully, I arrive at the final result of 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and each step follows logically from the previous one. So, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, computing each layer step by step:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use this result in the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, compute the outermost layer:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, the structure of the problem is like this: starting from the innermost part, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me try to write this out step by step to visualize it better. \n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n1. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.\n2. Then, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result from step 1.\n3. I'll continue this process, working my way outward, each time computing the next layer by taking 1 plus 3 times the result from the previous step.\n4. Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I'll need to compute nine layers. Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses to be sure. Hmm, starting from the innermost, each time there's an opening parenthesis, so let me see: the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, counting the opening parentheses after each 1+3: starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. Let me count them: the first is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. \n\nWait, maybe it's easier to just start computing from the innermost layer and work my way outwards. So, let's do that.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's simple, 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\nStep 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times the result from step 1. So, that would be 1 + 3 * 4. Let me compute that: 3 * 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.\n\nStep 3: Next layer out is 1 + 3 times the result from step 2. So, 1 + 3 * 13. Let's compute that: 3 * 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\nStep 4: Next layer: 1 + 3 times the result from step 3. So, 1 + 3 * 40. 3 * 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nStep 5: Next layer: 1 + 3 times 121. Let's compute that: 3 * 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nStep 6: Next layer: 1 + 3 times 364. 3 * 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nStep 7: Next layer: 1 + 3 times 1093. 3 * 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\nStep 8: Next layer: 1 + 3 times 3280. 3 * 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\nStep 9: Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3 times 9841. Let's compute that: 3 * 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, after step 9, we're supposed to multiply the entire result by 3, right? Because the entire expression is 3 times (the big nested expression). So, let me make sure I didn't miss that. The structure is 3( ... ), where the ... is the nested expression. So, after computing the nested part, I need to multiply it by 3.\n\nWait, but in my steps above, I started with the innermost and worked outwards, but perhaps I missed the outermost 3. Let me recount. Let me see how many layers there are. Each time I compute a layer, I'm moving outward, so the number of layers is the number of times I have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression. Let's see:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time there's a (1+3(...)), so let's count the number of times we have a 1+3(...). Let me parse this:\n\nStarting from the innermost, the first is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the innermost is the first layer, then each time we have a new layer. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, that's layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, the next is 1+3*(layer1), that's layer2.\n- Then, 1+3*(layer2), layer3.\n- And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Let me look at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have an opening parenthesis after 1+3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), so that's one opening parenthesis.\n- Then, each subsequent layer adds another opening parenthesis. So, let me count them:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3( ... ))\n3. (1+3( ... ))\n...\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of 1+3(...) terms. Let me see: each time we have a 1+3 followed by an opening parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, which is the first term, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many 1+3 terms are there?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of the number of layers as the number of times 1+3 is nested. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times 1+3 appears, each followed by an opening parenthesis. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then moving out, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, let's count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\n1. The innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the first 1+3 is without any parentheses, then each subsequent layer adds an opening parenthesis after 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1.\n- Then, the next layer is 1+3(1+3), which is layer 2.\n- Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3)), layer3.\n- Continuing this way, each layer adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times we have 1+3 followed by a parenthesis. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1+3 followed by a parenthesis. Let's count the number of such instances.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, no parenthesis after it, so that's layer 1.\n2. The next layer is 1+3(1+3), which is layer 2.\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3)), layer3.\n4. Continuing, each time we add another layer by nesting another 1+3(...).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have a 1+3 followed by a parenthesis. Let me count that.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3, not followed by a parenthesis, so that's layer 1.\n- Then, moving out, each time we have a 1+3 followed by a parenthesis. Let me count how many times that happens.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because each time we add a layer, but let me check.\n\nWait, another approach: the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ( ... )). So, each time we have a 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is the number of times this occurs. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just proceed step by step, computing each layer as I go, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, step 1: innermost is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nStep 2: next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nStep 3: next layer is 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nStep 4: next layer is 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nStep 5: next layer is 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nStep 6: next layer is 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nStep 7: next layer is 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nStep 8: next layer is 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nStep 9: next layer is 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but now, after step 9, we have the outermost expression, which is 3 times that result, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing the nested part as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 3 * 29524.\n\nFirst, 3 * 20000 = 60000.\n\n3 * 9000 = 27000.\n\n3 * 500 = 1500.\n\n3 * 24 = 72.\n\nAdding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in the steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount the number of layers I computed.\n\nI did 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nEach time, after the initial 3(, there are 8 more 1+3(...) terms, right? Because the expression is 3(1+3(...)), and inside that, there's another 1+3(...), and so on, eight times.\n\nWait, so perhaps I did one too many steps. Let me recount.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize the expression as having 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3(...). Let me check the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, no parenthesis after it, so that's the first layer.\n\n2. Then, moving out, the next is 1+3(1+3), which is the second layer.\n\n3. Then, 1+3(1+3(1+3)), third layer.\n\n4. Continuing, each time adding another layer.\n\nWait, so the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Let me count them.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time after 1+3, there's an opening parenthesis. Let me count how many times that happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n- The first 1+3 is at the end, without a parenthesis after, so that's layer 1.\n\n- Then, moving out, each 1+3 is followed by a parenthesis, so:\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(...\n\nLayer 3: 1+3(...\n\n...\n\nUp to layer 9: 1+3(...\n\nWait, but that would mean there are 9 layers, each time adding another 1+3(...). So, I think my initial approach was correct, with 9 layers, ending up with 29524 before multiplying by 3, giving 88572.\n\nBut let me check this again, because sometimes when you count layers, you might miscount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from layer 1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 1+3(...) terms inside the main expression.\n\nEach time, after the initial 3(, there are 8 more 1+3(...) terms, right? Because each time you have a 1+3 followed by another expression in parentheses.\n\nWait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, no parenthesis after it.\n\n2. Then, moving out, each 1+3 is followed by a parenthesis, so:\n\n- The first 1+3 after the innermost is 1+3(1+3), which is the second layer.\n\n- Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...\n\nSo, how many times does 1+3( occur? Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds a 1+3 followed by a parenthesis. So, from the innermost, the first 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the total number of layers is equal to the number of 1+3 terms, which is 9.\n\nWait, but when I computed 9 layers, I ended up with 29524 before multiplying by 3. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nBut let me confirm this by an alternative method, perhaps using a formula for such recursive expressions.\n\nEach layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1\n\n-2K = 1\n\nK = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I obtained earlier by iterative computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this using another approach, perhaps by expanding the expression step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the value by recognizing the pattern.\n\nWait, another approach: since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have 9 layers, then the value after 9 layers is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, as we found earlier.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it using iterative computation, using the recurrence relation, and using the formula for the general term, and all methods give the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Third Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourth Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Fifth Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Sixth Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Seventh Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Eighth Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Ninth Layer:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start from the inside. The innermost part is 1+3. That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Got it. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, hold on. Let me look again. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, it's like each step is 1 + 3*(something). So, let me try to write this down step by step.\n\nLet me denote each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost, each time I have 1 + 3(...). Let me count: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I have an opening parenthesis, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first parenthesis is after the first 1, then another after the next 1, and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the main expression.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to just compute each level step by step. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(...). So after computing Level 9, which is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's do this step by step. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, did I count the levels correctly? Let me check. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, moving out, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers? Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost, there are 9 layers? Wait, no. Let me see: the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, the main expression is 3*(...). Inside that, there's a 1 + 3*(...), which is level 1. Then, inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), level 2, and so on. How many levels? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to visualize:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Level 9, because each time we have another 1+3*(...), and there are 9 such layers inside the main expression.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...), and how many such layers? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) inside:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\n...\n\nContinuing until there are 9 layers? Wait, no, let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, the main expression is 3*(...). Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...). Then, inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until we reach the innermost 1+3.\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3(...) inside:\n\nFrom the main expression:\n\n- 3*(1+3*(...))\n\nInside that:\n\n- 1+3*(1+3*(...))\n\nInside that:\n\n- 1+3*(1+3*(...))\n\nAnd so on. Each time, it's another 1+3*(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLet me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\nWait, so the innermost is 1+3, which is level 1. Then, each subsequent level adds another 1+3*(...). So, how many levels are there? Let me see: from the innermost, each time we go out, we add another level. So, starting from level 1 as 1+3, then level 2 is 1+3*(level1), level3 is 1+3*(level2), etc., up to level 9, because the expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3*(...). Wait, let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, from level 1 to level 9. So, level 1 is 1+3=4. Then, level 2 is 1 + 3*4=13. Level3: 1 +3*13=40. Level4:1+3*40=121. Level5:1+3*121=364. Level6:1+3*364=1093. Level7:1+3*1093=3280. Level8:1+3*3280=9841. Level9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Level9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the innermost is level1, then each level adds another layer, so level9 would be the outermost before the main 3*(...). So, the main expression is 3*(level9). So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the levels. Let me recount the number of 1+3(...) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n\n4. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))\n\n5. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\n6. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\n7. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\n8. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\n9. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. So, level1:4, level2:13, level3:40, level4:121, level5:364, level6:1093, level7:3280, level8:9841, level9:29524. Then, the main expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me confirm this by computing each level step by step.\n\nLevel1:1+3=4\n\nLevel2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLevel3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLevel4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLevel5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLevel6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLevel7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLevel8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLevel9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, the main expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the right number of levels. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a level. Let me see: how many 1+3's are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\n4. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n\n5. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\n6. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\n7. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\n8. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\n9. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, meaning 9 levels. So, my earlier computation seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each level again step by step.\n\nLevel1:1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel2:1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel3:1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel4:1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel5:1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel6:1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel7:1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel8:1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel9:1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the main expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in multiplying 3*29524. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*      3\n\n--------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels, let me try a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach works. Let's say, for example, compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). So, a smaller version with three layers.\n\nCompute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n\nFirst, innermost:1+3=4\n\nNext layer:1+3*4=13\n\nOuter layer:1+3*13=40\n\nThen, multiply by 3:3*40=120\n\nLet me compute it directly:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nYes, that works. So, my method is correct.\n\nSimilarly, let's try with two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nInnermost:1+3=4\n\nNext layer:1+3*4=13\n\nMultiply by 3:3*13=39.\n\nCompute directly:3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))=3*(1 + 3*4)=3*(1 +12)=3*13=39. Correct.\n\nSo, my approach is valid. Therefore, applying it to the original problem, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That makes sense because each inner expression is part of the larger one, so I need to compute the innermost one first and work my way outwards.\n\nAlright, let me start by identifying how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so I can count them. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of 3s multiplied. Hmm, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3 multiplied by 3. Wait, maybe I should just start from the inside and compute each layer one by one.\n\nSo, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, that innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and 1 plus 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.\n\nMoving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute 3 times 13, which is 39. Then, 1 plus 39 is 40. So, this layer simplifies to 40.\n\nNext layer out: 1 + 3*(40). 3 times 40 is 120. Adding 1 gives me 121. So, that's 121.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*(121). 3 times 121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, this layer is 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute 3 times 364. 3 times 300 is 900, 3 times 64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093. So, that's 1093.\n\nMoving out another layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute 3 times 1093. 3 times 1000 is 3000, 3 times 93 is 279, so adding those together gives 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, adding 1 gives 3280. So, this layer is 3280.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(3280). Let's compute 3 times 3280. 3 times 3000 is 9000, 3 times 280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, this layer is 9841.\n\nContinuing outward: 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute 3 times 9841. Hmm, 3 times 9000 is 27,000, 3 times 800 is 2,400, 3 times 41 is 123. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400, plus 123 is 29,523. Then, adding 1 gives 29,524. So, this layer is 29,524.\n\nWait a second, I think I've gone through all the layers now. Let me check how many layers there were. Starting from the innermost, each time I worked outwards, I did 9 layers in total. So, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by that last result. So, 3 times 29,524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 times 29,524. Let me break it down: 3 times 20,000 is 60,000, 3 times 9,000 is 27,000, 3 times 500 is 1,500, 3 times 24 is 72. Now, adding all those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3 times 29,524 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to slip up with large numbers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check each step again because I might have miscalculated one of the steps.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3. Let's compute 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3. Let me compute 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by 29,524. Let me compute 29,524*3.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 24 * 3 = 72\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't skip any steps, let me recount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis corresponds to an opening one. Let me count the number of layers by the number of 3s before each innermost expression.\n\nWait, actually, each (1+3(...)) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and I double-checked each multiplication to ensure accuracy. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer simplifies step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " \n\nSo, the structure is like this: starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3) multiplied by 3 and added to 1. It's kind of like a chain of operations. Maybe I can solve it by expanding each layer one by one, starting from the inside and moving outwards. Let me try that.\n\nLet me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. So, the innermost part is (1+3). Let me compute that first.\n\nFirst layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from first layer). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that.\n\nSecond layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so that gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from second layer). So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that.\n\nThird layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, that's 40. Next layer out is 1 + 3*(result from third layer). So, 1 + 3*40. Let me compute that.\n\nFourth layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nAlright, so that's 121. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(121). So, 1 + 3*121. Let me do that.\n\nFifth layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nOkay, that's 364. Next layer out is 1 + 3*(364). So, 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate that.\n\nSixth layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nWow, that's a big number. So, 1093. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(1093). Let me compute that.\n\nSeventh layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nHmm, 3280. Next layer out is 1 + 3*(3280). Let me figure that out.\n\nEighth layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nOkay, so that's 9841. Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(9841). Let me compute that.\n\nNinth layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nAlright, so that's 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that.\n\nOutermost layer: 3*29524. Let me do the multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, 29524 multiplied by 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3 = 6, plus 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because 29,524 * 3. Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, minus 476*3 because 30,000 - 476 = 29,524. So, 476*3 is 1,428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each step again quickly to verify.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically, and I didn't skip any layers. So, I think the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me check one more time because sometimes when dealing with so many layers, it's easy to miscount or make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me compute each step numerically again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. Each step adds up correctly, and the final multiplication is accurate. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach to verify this. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of expanding each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result), perhaps this is a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n represents the value at the nth layer. So, starting from the innermost layer, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nAnd then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, this sequence approach confirms the same result. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, which might make computation faster for larger n, but in this case, since n=9, it's manageable manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B).\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1.\n\nThus, B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2.\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A.\n\nWhich is 9/2 = 3A.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value we got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nThis confirms that the result is indeed 88,572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is effectively building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. However, the recurrence approach seems solid and gives the same result as the step-by-step computation.\n\nJust to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each step again numerically:\n\n1. Start with (1+3) = 4.\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, every step checks out. I think I'm confident now that 88,572 is the correct answer. It's a pretty large number, but given the multiple layers of multiplication by 3, it makes sense that the result would be so large.\n\nI don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think I'm done here. The answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nWe can solve this by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Work outward, computing each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. Finally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Outermost layer: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841\n\n3*9841: Let me compute that. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the Level 9 result. So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't skip any levels or make a mistake in the levels. Let me recount the levels.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Level 1: 1+3=4\n\n2. Level 2: 1+3*4=13\n\n3. Level 3: 1+3*13=40\n\n4. Level 4: 1+3*40=121\n\n5. Level 5: 1+3*121=364\n\n6. Level 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\n7. Level 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\n8. Level 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\n9. Level 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step followed logically, and I checked each multiplication as I went along. It might seem tedious, but breaking it down step by step helped prevent errors. I was a bit worried about keeping track of all the levels, but numbering them from 1 to 9 made it manageable.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). So, it's a recursive-like structure where each term depends on the one before it. It's similar to a geometric series, but each term is built by multiplying the previous term by 3 and adding 1. Maybe there's a formula for such a series, but since there are only nine levels, computing each step manually isn't too bad.\n\nI could also represent this as a function. Let me define f(n) as the value of the expression with n levels. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. So, f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, f(3)=1 + 3*13=40, and so on, up to f(9)=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9)=88572.\n\nThis recursive approach might be a more efficient way to compute it, especially if the number of levels were larger. But for nine levels, manual computation works fine.\n\nI wonder if there's a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see, the recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), which is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be f(n) = A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant. Let's assume f(n) = C. Substituting into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition f(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check that with n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier result. Then, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to get the same answer, using the closed-form formula.\n\nThis makes me feel more confident that 88572 is indeed the correct answer. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allowed me to derive a formula, which could be useful for larger numbers of levels. But for this problem, since it's only nine levels, the step-by-step computation was manageable.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and even double-checked using a different method. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost parentheses. By computing each level step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses**: Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. **Work Outwards**: Each subsequent level is computed by taking 1 + 3*(result from the previous level).\n   - Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Level 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Level 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Level 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Level 9 by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " That makes sense because when you have nested parentheses, you usually start solving from the innermost one and work your way outwards.\n\nAlright, so let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nHmm, I can see that each time, there's a 1 added to 3 times another expression. It seems like there are nine layers of this, right? Let me count the opening parentheses. Each time there's a new set, so starting from the left, each 3 is multiplied by a term that has another 1 + 3(...). So, let's see: starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Then, each step out adds another layer. So, maybe I can compute this by starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step. Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me check: starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, actually, the total number of layers is 9, since each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. So, let's compute each layer one by one.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, moving on to Layer 3:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, okay, so each layer is building up quickly. Let me write down each step as I go along.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That's correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Okay.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWait, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1092 +1 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093\n\nHmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 3279 +1 = 3280.\n\nWait, let me check that again: 3*1093. Let me compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 3279 +1 is 3280. Yes, that's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280\n\nSo, 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 9840 +1 = 9841.\n\nWait, let me double-check: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 9840 +1 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841\n\nOkay, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 29523 +1 = 29524.\n\nWait, let me compute 3*9841 step by step:\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, carryover 1\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, carryover 2\n\n9*3=27 +2=29.\n\nSo, writing it down: 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. That's Layer 9.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n3*29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check using another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) *3.\n\n20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my layers again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers I have.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1+3(...) adds a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, that's 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, does that mean there are 9 layers? Or 10? Hmm, maybe I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each time you have a new (1+3(...)), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), which is Layer 1, then each time you go out, you add a new layer. So, if there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, that would mean 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I went up to Layer 9, which gave me 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure that I correctly accounted for all layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should visualize the structure. Let me try to write the expression with each layer:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote L1 = 1 + 3\n\nThen L2 = 1 + 3*L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2\n\n...\n\nUp to L9 = 1 + 3*L8\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9.\n\nSo, that's correct. So, I computed up to L9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each layer's computation because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again because 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 3279 +1=3280. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280. Let me compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 9840 +1=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3:\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n800*3=2400\n\n40*3=120\n\n1*3=3\n\nSo, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 29523 +1=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 29524*3 another way to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524*3:\n\nBreak it down digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 29524*3 using another method. Let's add 29524 three times:\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = ?\n\nLet's add 59048 + 29524:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n8 +4=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n4 +2=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n0 +5=5, write 5.\n\n9 +9=18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\n5 +2=7 +1=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the sum is 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So, let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, so that's 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, which would imply 9 layers. But when I computed earlier, I had Layer 1 to Layer 9, which is 9 layers, each time building up. So, that seems correct. So, the final computation is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again, step by step, because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the arithmetic.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, writing down each step clearly.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nStep 1: Compute (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(result from Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 2: 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 3: 40\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 4: 121\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 5: 364\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 6: 1093\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 7: 3280\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 8: 9841\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(result from Step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nStep 9: 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(result from Step 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll try to compute it using a different approach, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a way to model this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, where a=1 and b=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nThus, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the formula for the linear recurrence, we arrive at the same result, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing that the expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. We compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then computed as:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate that the operations inside should be done first.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, I see a 1 plus 3. Let me write that down:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, so that simplifies the innermost parentheses to 4. Now, moving one level out, I have another 1 plus 3 times that result. So, the next level is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, so now that simplifies to 13. Moving out another level, I have another 1 plus 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, that's 40. I can see a pattern here where each level is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me keep going step by step to avoid getting lost.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWhoa, that's a big jump. 121. Let's go another level out.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nOkay, 364. Continuing on.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nWow, that's getting really large. Let's see the next one.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nHmm, 3280. I think I have a few more levels to go.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nAlright, 9841. Now, moving out another level.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nOkay, 29524. Now, the next level.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWow, that's massive. Now, finally, the outermost level.\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 3 times 88,573. Let's compute 88,573 * 3:\n\n88,573 * 3:\n3 * 3 = 9\n3 * 7 = 21, carryover 2\n3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1\n3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2\n3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26\n\nSo, 88,573 * 3 = 265,719. Then, adding 1 gives 265,720. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the innermost parentheses worked their way out to give me 265,720. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times this result. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 265,720.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n3 * 265,720 = ?\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n3 * 200,000 = 600,000\n\n3 * 60,000 = 180,000\n\n3 * 5,000 = 15,000\n\n3 * 700 = 2,100\n\n3 * 20 = 60\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000\n\n780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000\n\n795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100\n\n797,100 + 60 = 797,160\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Maybe I broke it down incorrectly. Alternatively, I can compute it as 265,720 * 3.\n\nLet me do it step by step:\n\n265,720\n*        3\n----------\nMultiply each digit from right to left:\n\n0 * 3 = 0\n\n2 * 3 = 6\n\n7 * 3 = 21, write down 1 and carryover 2\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7 and carryover 1\n\n6 * 3 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9 and carryover 1\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 1 = 16, write down 6 and carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the right: 0, 6, 1 (with a carryover 2), 7 (with a carryover 1), 9 (with a carryover 1), 6 (with a carryover 1), 7. Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute 265,720 * 3:\n\n265,720\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n0 * 3 = 0\n\n2 * 3 = 6\n\n7 * 3 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1\n\n6 * 3 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carryover 1\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 1 = 16, write down 6, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom to top: 7, 6, 9, 7, 1, 6, 0. Wait, that would be 769,7160? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the placement.\n\nWait, let's do it more carefully:\n\n265,720\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n0 * 3 = 0 (units place)\n\n2 * 3 = 6 (tens place)\n\n7 * 3 = 21 (hundreds place): write down 1, carryover 2\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 (thousands place): write down 7, carryover 1\n\n6 * 3 = 18 + 1 = 19 (ten thousands place): write down 9, carryover 1\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 1 = 16 (hundred thousands place): write down 6, carryover 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 (millions place)\n\nSo, writing it out: 7 (millions), 6 (hundred thousands), 9 (ten thousands), 7 (thousands), 1 (hundreds), 6 (tens), 0 (units). So, that's 769,7160? Wait, that can't be right because 769,7160 is 7,697,160. Wait, but 265,720 * 3 is 797,160, right? Wait, maybe I messed up the digit positions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it as:\n\n265,720 * 3:\n\n200,000 * 3 = 600,000\n\n60,000 * 3 = 180,000\n\n5,000 * 3 = 15,000\n\n700 * 3 = 2,100\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n0 * 3 = 0\n\nAdding them up:\n\n600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000\n\n780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000\n\n795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100\n\n797,100 + 60 = 797,160\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 265,720 * 3 = 797,160.\n\nWait, so I think earlier when I did the digit-wise multiplication, I might have miscounted the digits. So, the correct result is 797,160.\n\nWait, so to recap, starting from the innermost parentheses, each step I computed the next level by taking 1 + 3*(previous result). I did that 9 times, right? Because the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first level. Then each subsequent level adds another 1+3*(...). So, in total, how many levels are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then inside is 1+3(...), and each time, another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3(...) occur? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3(...). So, from the innermost, how many layers?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so actually, each time you go out a level, you add another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost as level 1, up to level 9. So, I think I did 9 layers, which would mean that the result after the innermost is 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88573, and then 265,720. Wait, but when I did the calculations earlier, I ended up with 265,720 after 9 layers, and then multiplied by 3 to get 797,160. So, that seems consistent.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps, let me go through each level again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720\n\nWait, hold on, that's 11 levels, but the original expression only has 9 sets of parentheses. So, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then each time a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\n1. The first innermost is 1+3\n2. Then each subsequent is another 1+3(...). So, how many 1+3(...) are there?\n\nLet me write the expression with numbers:\n\nLevel 1: 1+3\n\nLevel 2: 1+3(Level 1)\n\nLevel 3: 1+3(Level 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Level 9: 1+3(Level 8)\n\nWait, so actually, there are 9 levels of 1+3(...). So, starting from Level 1 to Level 9, each time 1+3*(previous level). Then, after computing Level 9, we multiply by 3.\n\nSo, perhaps I went one level too far earlier. Let me recount:\n\n1. Level 1: 1+3 = 4\n\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so after Level 9, the result is 29524, not 265,720. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9 result) = 3*29524.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by going one level too far. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, Level 1: 4\n\nLevel 2: 13\n\nLevel 3: 40\n\nLevel 4: 121\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nLevel 6: 1093\n\nLevel 7: 3280\n\nLevel 8: 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*29524:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, reading it from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,572? Wait, no, let me write it properly:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12: write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7: write 7\n\n5*3=15: write 5, carryover 1\n\n9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8: write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, so 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000 *3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, so that's different from my earlier calculation where I thought the innermost result was 265,720, but that was because I went one level too far. So, actually, after 9 levels, the result is 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by counting one extra level. So, the correct result should be 88,572.\n\nLet me just make sure that I have the correct number of levels.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of 1+3(...) expressions:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n\nThen each time, another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 appear?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(, then inside is 1+3(...). Each time, the number of opening parentheses increases. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances.\n\n1. 1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3\n\nWait, so there are 9 instances of 1+3(...), meaning 9 levels. So, starting from the innermost as level 1, up to level 9.\n\nSo, level 1: 1+3=4\n\nLevel 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLevel 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLevel 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLevel 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLevel 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLevel 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLevel 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLevel 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88,572.\n\nSo, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought I had 9 levels, I ended up with 265,720, which was actually 10 levels. So, perhaps I miscounted earlier. So, with 9 levels, it's 29,524, then 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me list the levels again:\n\nLevel 1: 1+3=4\n\nLevel 2:1+3*4=13\n\nLevel3:1+3*13=40\n\nLevel4:1+3*40=121\n\nLevel5:1+3*121=364\n\nLevel6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLevel7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLevel8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLevel9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nSo, after level9, it's 29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the number of levels, which led me to an incorrect result. So, the correct approach is to recognize that there are 9 levels of 1+3(...) expressions, starting from the innermost, and each level is computed by taking 1 + 3*(previous result). After computing the 9th level, which gives 29,524, we then multiply that by 3 to get the final result, which is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute each level again:\n\nLevel1: 1+3=4\n\nLevel2:1+3*4=1+12=13\n\nLevel3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLevel4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLevel5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLevel6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLevel7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLevel8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLevel9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the correct answer is 88,572.\n\nI feel confident now that I didn't make a mistake in the calculations after recounting the levels properly. So, the key was to recognize the number of levels in the nested expressions and compute each step carefully without skipping ahead.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the result of each layer and use it to compute the next. After computing the ninth layer, we multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Level 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Level 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Level 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Level 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Level 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Level 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Level 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Level 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step: Multiply by 3:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so maybe I should start by simplifying the innermost part and work my way outwards. Let's count how many layers there are. Starting from the left, I see 1+3, then that's inside another 1+3(...), and so on, until the very end. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep the nesting goes. \n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(1+3(...), each subsequent 1+3(...) is nested inside the previous one. Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost: \n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Continuing this way, how many layers do I have? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Hmm, the expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 is written: 1. The innermost is 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. Let me count them: 1+3, then another 1+3 inside, so that's 2, then 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, actually, the expression starts with 3(1+3(...)) and inside that, there are 8 more layers of 1+3(...). So in total, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3 multiplied by 3 each time. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the expression as a series of nested functions. Let me denote each nested part as a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So f(1) = 1+3, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1), f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2), and so on, up to f(9), since there are 9 layers of 1+3. Then the entire expression is 3*f(9). That seems manageable. So, if I can compute f(9), then multiply by 3, I'll have the answer.\n\nSo, let's define f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. f(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. f(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. f(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. f(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. f(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. f(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*f(9). So 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step again:\n\nf(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nf(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nf(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nf(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nf(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nf(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nf(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nf(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nf(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check f(9) again because 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524, correct. Then 3*29524: Let's compute that.\n\n3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. So adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +72 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of recursive expression. Because calculating each step manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if the number of layers is large. Let me see if I can find a general formula for f(n). \n\nGiven that f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: f(n) - 3*f(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p(n) = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstitute f_p(n) into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolve for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A\n\nSubtract 3A from both sides:\n\n-2A = 1\n\nSo A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, f(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nf(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: f(2)=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: f(3)=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: f(4)=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: f(5)=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: f(6)=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: f(7)=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: f(8)=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: f(9)=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. \n\nSo the formula works. Therefore, f(9)=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. For n=9, f(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so n+1=10. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000\n\n500*3=1500\n\n24*3=72\n\nAdd them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try computing f(9) using the recursive method again, step by step, to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors earlier.\n\nStarting from f(1)=4.\n\nf(2)=1 + 3*4=13\n\nf(3)=1 + 3*13=40\n\nf(4)=1 + 3*40=121\n\nf(5)=1 + 3*121=364\n\nf(6)=1 + 3*364=1093\n\nf(7)=1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nf(8)=1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nf(9)=1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's consistent with the formula.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the problem was a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer, starting from the innermost 1+3 and working outwards. By defining a recursive function f(n) for each layer, I was able to compute each step up to f(9), then multiply by 3 to get the final result. Additionally, by recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, I found a closed-form formula to compute f(n) directly, which confirmed the step-by-step calculation. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the next layer. By defining a recursive function \\(f(n)\\) for each layer, we can compute each step up to \\(f(9)\\), then multiply by 3 to get the final result. \n\n1. **Define the recursive function**: \\(f(n) = 1 + 3 \\times f(n-1)\\), with \\(f(1) = 4\\).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - \\(f(1) = 4\\)\n   - \\(f(2) = 13\\)\n   - \\(f(3) = 40\\)\n   - \\(f(4) = 121\\)\n   - \\(f(5) = 364\\)\n   - \\(f(6) = 1093\\)\n   - \\(f(7) = 3280\\)\n   - \\(f(8) = 9841\\)\n   - \\(f(9) = 29524\\)\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\(3 \\times f(9) = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

The entire expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (another similar expression)). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time there's a 1 + 3(...), so let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how deep it goes. \n\nStarting from the first 3(...), each subsequent parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count: 3(...), then another 3(...), and so on. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each step adds another 1 + 3 times the next. Let me try to count how many layers there are. \n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each time another 1+3 around it. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, so let me see: \n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's the first layer.\n2. Then inside that, another 3(...), so that's the second layer.\n3. Continuing this way, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s before the first 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times we have 1+3(...). Let me see: \n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3.\n2. Then moving out, it's 1+3*(innermost result).\n3. Then the next layer is 1+3*(previous result).\n4. And so on, until we reach the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) instances. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. Let me count how many opening parentheses there are after the initial 3. \n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the first 3, there are nine opening parentheses, each corresponding to a 1+3(...) layer. Wait, no, actually, each layer is a 1+3(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) instances.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first 3, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, it's another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3, so that's one layer.\n2. Then moving out, each time another 1+3(...). Let's see: starting from the innermost, each layer is another 1+3. So, how many times do we have 1+3? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each time moving outward, it's another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9. Wait, let me see: \n\nThe expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3*(1+3*(...)), and the innermost is 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3*(1+3*... parts. \n\nEach time, the expression is 3*(1+3*(...)), so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 3*(1+3*(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, because after the initial 3, there are 9 more layers. Wait, no, let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections. \n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that each time you have a 1+3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1: 1+3. Then layer 2 is 1+3*(layer 1). Layer 3 is 1+3*(layer 2), and so on, until layer 9, which is the outermost layer. So, we have 9 layers in total. Therefore, I need to compute this starting from the innermost layer and moving outward, computing each layer step by step.\n\nSo, let me start by computing the innermost layer, which is 1+3. That's easy: 1+3=4. Then, the next layer is 1+3*(result of innermost layer). So, layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, after computing layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. \n\nFirst, let me compute 29524*3. \n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n- The next digit is 0, so 0*3=0, but since it's the leading digit, it's just 0.\n\nWait, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each digit by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Therefore, 3*29524=88572. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with carries. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the innermost layer is 4, then each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous result). After computing all 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*(result of layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) instances. \n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3 \u2192 layer 1\n2. 1+3*(layer 1) \u2192 layer 2\n3. 1+3*(layer 2) \u2192 layer 3\n4. 1+3*(layer 3) \u2192 layer 4\n5. 1+3*(layer 4) \u2192 layer 5\n6. 1+3*(layer 5) \u2192 layer 6\n7. 1+3*(layer 6) \u2192 layer 7\n8. 1+3*(layer 7) \u2192 layer 8\n9. 1+3*(layer 8) \u2192 layer 9\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers. Therefore, the computation is correct, leading to 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me write down each step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since there are only 9 layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let me solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 + 1/2 = 3C \u21d2 9/2 = 3C \u21d2 C = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I can compute the result more efficiently, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since there are only 9 layers, both methods work fine.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, it's equivalent to 3*(a_9), where a_9 is computed as above.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(next term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

    "text": " That makes sense because parentheses indicate that the operations inside should be done first.\n\nSo, let me start from the innermost part and work my way out. The innermost part is 1+3, right? That's simple enough. Let's compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So, that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me calculate that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, the next level out is 13. \n\nAlright, let's keep going. The next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. So, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that, 3 times 13 is 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, moving out another level, we have 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 40. Let me compute that. 3 times 40 is 120, and then 1 + 120 is 121. So, now we're at 121.\n\nNext, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3 times 121. Let me do that. 3 times 121 is 363, and adding 1 gives us 364. So, that's 364.\n\nContinuing further, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 364. Let me calculate that. 3 times 364 is 1,092, and adding 1 gives 1,093. So, now we're at 1,093.\n\nMoving out another level, it's 1 + 3 times 1,093. Let me compute that. 3 times 1,093 is 3,279, and then 1 + 3,279 is 3,280. So, that's 3,280.\n\nNext, the expression is 1 + 3 times 3,280. Calculating that, 3 times 3,280 is 9,840, and adding 1 gives us 9,841. So, now we're at 9,841.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3 times 9,841. Let me figure that out. 3 times 9,841 is 29,523, and then adding 1 gives 29,524. So, that's 29,524.\n\nNow, moving out another level, it's 1 + 3 times 29,524. Let me compute that. 3 times 29,524 is 88,572, and adding 1 gives 88,573. So, now we're at 88,573.\n\nNext, the outermost expression is 1 + 3 times 88,573. Let me calculate that. 3 times 88,573 is 265,719, and adding 1 gives 265,720. So, that's 265,720.\n\nWait a second, but hold on. I think I might have miscounted the number of levels. Let me check how many times the pattern repeats. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and each time I worked outwards, I think I did 9 levels because each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))) So, each level adds another set. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears: starting from the innermost, each step is one more level. So, from the innermost 1+3, then next is 1+3*(4), then 1+3*(13), and so on until the outermost. I think I did 9 levels, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps my calculation is correct.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me recount each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29,524 = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88,573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720\n\nWait, so I actually have 11 levels? Because starting from 1+3 as level 1, then each subsequent step adds another level. Let me check how many opening parentheses there are after the initial 3. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3 is 9, because each \"1 + 3(\" adds another. So, that would mean 9 levels of nesting. Therefore, I think I went one level too far in my calculation. Let me recount:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (level 1)\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (level 2)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (level 3)\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (level 4)\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (level 5)\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 (level 6)\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 (level 7)\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 (level 8)\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 (level 9)\n\nSo, after 9 levels, the result is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by going one level too far. So, the outermost expression is 3*(result of level 9). Therefore, the final step is to compute 3*29,524.\n\nLet me compute that. 29,524 multiplied by 3. Let me break that down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I think I might have miscalculated. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29,524\ntimes 3\n________\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I thought I had 9 levels, leading to 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. But earlier, I thought I had 11 levels, which was incorrect because the number of opening parentheses is 9, meaning 9 levels of nesting, and then the outermost 3 times that. So, I think I confused myself earlier by going one level too far, but now I've corrected it.\n\nWait, let me confirm the number of levels again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one level, and each subsequent \"1+3(...)\" adds another level. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" instances:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(\", meaning 9 levels of nesting. Therefore, I should have 9 results, starting from 4 up to 29,524, and then the final multiplication by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I first started calculating, I went up to 265,720, which was 11 levels, but that was incorrect because I miscounted. So, the correct number of levels is 9, leading to the final result of 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be absolutely sure. It's easy to make a mistake in these nested expressions.\n\nLet me list each level:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can derive a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n levels, the value at level n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have 9 levels, starting from a_1 = 4. So, n=9. Let me compute a_9 using the formula.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can confirm that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it as a geometric series, each level is 1 + 3*(previous level), which can be expanded as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) and so on. Each term can be represented as a sum of powers of 3 multiplied by 1, but since each level adds a higher power, it's a finite geometric series.\n\nBut since we've already used the recurrence relation and confirmed the result, I think it's safe to say that the answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3*29,524 again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after carefully working through each level and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each level step by step:\n\n1. Innermost level: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing the innermost 9 levels, we get the result 29524. The entire expression is then multiplied by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"
