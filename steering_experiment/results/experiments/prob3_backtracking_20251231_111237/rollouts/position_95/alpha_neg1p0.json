For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^(p) = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but a_1 is the first term, which is 4. So, when n=1, a_1=4. So, substituting into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, which is correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, the value at Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring.

    "text": " The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since the number of layers is small, computing each step is straightforward. However, for practice, let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, the initial condition is a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Wait, actually, let me check the recurrence. If I define a_n as the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.

Let me see. Let me index the layers starting from 0. Let me define a_0 = 1. Then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches Layer 1. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is Layer 2.

    "text": " So, in general, for such a recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a geometric progression. The general solution is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 * something? Wait, let me recall the formula for linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Hmm, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, 3^{10} = 59049. Then, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So that's the same result as before. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. So, I think that's the correct solution.

The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition: At n=1, a_1 = 4. So 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Let me see, for the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the steady-state solution is when a_n = a_{n-1} = a. So, a = 1 + 3a => a - 3a = 1 => -2a = 1 => a = -1/2.

    "text": " The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric progression. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the formula confirms my step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of each layer as multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but since it's a fixed number of layers, the step-by-step approach is straightforward. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me recompute the layers quickly: Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524.

    "text": " The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, here, k = 3, c = 1. The general solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, let me think. Actually, the standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. The solution is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). But in our case, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. Wait, actually, maybe I should adjust the indices. Let me define a_0 as the innermost term. So, a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_8, which would be the outermost term before multiplying by 3. So, if I use the formula for the linear recurrence, the solution is a_n = 3^{n+1} + (something). Wait, maybe it's better to compute using the formula. Let's see. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_0 = 4: 4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = C - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2. Let's test this for n=0: a_0 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = (81/2) - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for a_8, which is the outermost term, n=8: a_8 = (9/2)*3^8 - 1/2. Let's compute that. First, 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, a_8 = (9/2)*6561 - 1/2. Compute (9/2)*6561: 9*6561 = let's compute that. 6561*9: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So, 54000 + 4500 = 58500, +540 = 59040, +9 = 59049. So, 59049/2 = 29524.5. Then, subtract 1/2: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_8 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*a_8, and a_8 = (9/2)*3^8 - 1/2, then 3*a_8 = 3*(9/2)*3^8 - 3*(1/2) = (27/2)*3^8 - 3/2. But 3^8 is 6561, so (27/2)*6561 = (27*6561)/2. Let me compute 27*6561: 27*6000=162000, 27*500=13500, 27*60=1620, 27*1=27. So, 162000 + 13500 = 175500, +1620 = 177120, +27 = 177147. Then, 177147/2 = 88573.5. Then subtract 3/2: 88573.5 - 1.5 = 88572. So that also gives us 88572. Either way, it seems consistent. So, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways: computing each layer step by step, using the recurrence relation formula, and even checking with the general solution for the linear recurrence. All methods lead to the same result, which is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, the solution is a_n = c*r^{n} + d, where d is a constant. Wait, more accurately, for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). In this case, k = 3, c = 1, and a_0 would be 1, but let's see. Wait, actually, our first term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, etc. So starting from n=1, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. So perhaps the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the general solution for a_n would be a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.

Now, our expression has 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^{10} is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same answer.

So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4.

The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same result.

    "text": " The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that approach. Let me denote a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, our layers go up to layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

However, just for practice, let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n.

    "text": " The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric progression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That's the same as Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both methods, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation formula, we determine that the innermost expression evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all layers, the final result is 29524, which is then multiplied by 3 to give the final answer of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} + c/(1 - k). Wait, in this case, k = 3, and c = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (a_1 - 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(1 - 3). Let's compute that. First, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_n = (4 - 1/(-2)) * 3^{n-1} + 1/(-2) = (4 + 1/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2 = (9/2) * 3^{n-1} - 1/2. Simplifying, that's (9 * 3^{n-1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (9*3^{0} -1)/2 = (9*1 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (9*3^{1} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (9*9 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (9*3^{8} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^8 is 6561. So, 9*6561 = let's compute 6561*9: 6561*10=65610, subtract 6561: 65610 - 6561=59049. So, 9*3^8=59049. Then, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula: a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Wait, let me check that. The standard form is a linear recurrence: a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s. The solution is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + s*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), assuming r \u2260 1. In our case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, r = 3, s = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, in our problem, the first term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches. So, using the formula, a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. But wait, a_0 would be the initial term when n=0. Let me think. If we set n=1, a_1 = 4. So, according to the formula: a_1 = 3^{1} * a_0 + (3^{1} - 1)/2. So, 4 = 3*a_0 + (3 - 1)/2 = 3*a_0 + 1. Therefore, 3*a_0 = 3, so a_0 = 1. So, the general formula is a_n = 3^{n} * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2: a_2 = 13, and so on up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step, that's another valid method. Either way, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).
