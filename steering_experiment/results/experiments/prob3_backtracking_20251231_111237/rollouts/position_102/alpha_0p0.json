Right side: A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, setting equal: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.

Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition.

Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, but our initial terms are integers, so maybe this approach isn't the best here, or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as a geometric series. Let's try expanding the expression. Starting from the innermost: Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) with nine layers. Let me try expanding the innermost first: Let me define E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. E_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. E_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. E_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. E_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. E_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method confirms the earlier calculation. Alternatively, if I wanted to find a formula for E_n, I could observe that E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is E_n = (E_0 - 1/2)*3^n + 1/2. Wait, let me check that. The homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say E_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition E_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.

Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Now, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Let's compute a_1 using the formula: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.

Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}.

Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then 3*a_9=88572. So, regardless of the method\u2014whether computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form formula\u2014we arrive at the same answer. I think that solidifies the conclusion.

Now, set equal to left side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation.

So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.

For constants: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition.

Alternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have saved time, but since I wasn't sure, computing each layer step by step was a good way to ensure accuracy. It's also a good exercise in recognizing patterns and recurrence relations, which is a useful skill in mathematics and computer science.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's not the correct way to break down 29524. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Alternatively, just multiply 29524 by 3 directly: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, 88572.

But since I already solved it using both methods, I think I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, labeling each for clarity.\n\n3. After computing the innermost layers, move outward, using the result of each layer in the computation of the next.\n\n4. Once all layers are computed, multiply the outermost result by 3 as per the original expression.\n\n5. Verify the result using an alternative method, such as recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it with a closed-form formula.\n\n6. Double-check the arithmetic to ensure no mistakes were made in multiplication.\n\nBy following these steps, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. It's a good practice to verify results using different methods to catch any possible errors, especially under time constraints or when dealing with complex expressions.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value and use it in the next computation. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows us to derive a closed-form formula, confirming our step-by-step result. Finally, multiplying the outermost result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both methods, step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Equate this to our assumed solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. But since each term adds 1 before multiplying, it's a bit more involved, but the recurrence relation approach worked well. Another way to think about it is that each layer is building up a number in base 3 or something, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Either way, computing each layer step by step seems straightforward and manageable, especially since there are only nine layers. So, to recap, I started from the innermost parentheses and worked my way out, computing each layer's value step by step. Each time, I took the previous layer's result, multiplied it by 3, added 1, and that gave me the next layer's value. After computing the ninth layer, I multiplied that result by 3 to get the final answer. I also double-checked my work using a different method involving recurrence relations, which confirmed that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.
