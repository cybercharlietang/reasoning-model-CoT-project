So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer.

    "text": " Then, a_{n-1} = A*3^{n-1} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, which is indeed (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. Then Layer 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, Layer n is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, our problem has 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, computing each layer step by step is straightforward and manageable, especially since there are only 9 layers. It's easy to get lost in the parentheses, but by systematically working from the inside out, I can avoid mistakes. Let me just recap the steps: 1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Substitute back into the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. 3. Continue this substitution for each subsequent layer, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. 4. After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524, multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88572. It's always good to verify each step, especially when dealing with multiple layers of nested expressions. I can also check the arithmetic at each step to ensure there are no calculation errors. For instance, when computing Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. That seems correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct. So, all the steps check out. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, I can compute a_9 directly: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Both methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows for a more efficient solution, avoiding the need to compute each layer individually. However, in this case, since there are only nine layers, the step-by-step computation is manageable without too much difficulty. If the expression were longer, say with 20 layers, using the closed-form formula would be much more efficient. But for nine layers, either method works. I think I've covered all the steps and verified each part, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Therefore, equate coefficients: For 3^n: A = A, which is fine. Constants: B = 3B + 1. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Hmm, but in our case, all the a_n are integers, so getting a fractional B seems odd. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the particular solution is a constant, so let's try a particular solution of the form a_n = C. Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2, which is the same as before. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.

Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula: Since a_n = (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2 = (3^{n+2}-3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Using the recurrence relation, we compute each layer up to \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.

Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute directly without computing each layer, but since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a good way to confirm the result.

Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the pattern:** The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next inner term.\n\n2. **Compute each layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:** 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Final Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to use the closed-form expression for the entire problem, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute that: 3*(59049 - 1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer.

Now, set equal to left-hand side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.
