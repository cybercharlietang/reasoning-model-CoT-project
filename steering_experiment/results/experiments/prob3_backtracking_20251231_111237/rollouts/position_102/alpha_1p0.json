    "text": " Let's plug into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, LHS: A*3^n + B = RHS: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that seems odd because our terms are all integers. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is different. Wait, let's solve the recurrence properly. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation.

Alternatively, if I had to compute this for a larger number of layers, the closed-form expression would be very useful. But for 9 layers, computing each step wasn't too bad.

So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value. But in our case, all the a_n are integers, so maybe this approach is complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern by computing more terms. Let me list the a_n values I have so far: a1 = 4 a2 = 13 a3 = 40 a4 = 121 a5 = 364 a6 = 1093 a7 = 3280 a8 = 9841 a9 = 29524 Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let's compute a few more terms to see if a pattern emerges. Wait, but in this case, we only have up to a9. Alternatively, perhaps each a_n is 3^{n+1} - something. Let me see: a1 = 4 = 3^2 - 5? No, 3^2 is 9, 9 - 5 is 4. a2 = 13 = 3^3 - 14? 27 - 14 =13. a3=40=3^4 - 37? 81 - 37=44, which is not 40. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this: For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4, which matches a1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches a2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40, which matches a3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=121, which matches a4=121. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=364, which matches a5=364. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093, which matches a6=1093. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280, which matches a7=3280. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841, which matches a8=9841. For n=9: (3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524, which matches a9=29524. Wow, that's a perfect fit! So, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is exactly what we computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Because 3*(3^{10})=3^{11}, and 3*1=3. So, (3^{11} -3)/2. Now, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed this pattern earlier and used the formula to compute directly, but since I was working step by step, computing each layer was straightforward and manageable.

Hmm, that's a fractional value, which seems odd given that all the layers are integers. Maybe I made a wrong assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is different. Wait, maybe the recurrence is nonhomogeneous, so let's solve it properly. The homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p.

For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as we computed earlier. So, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1, but the way I approached it initially, computing each layer step by step, seems to have worked fine. It's good to verify using a different method to ensure that the answer is consistent. So, both methods give me the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 3 times (1 plus another expression). By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence relation provides a closed-form solution, which confirms the result obtained by step-by-step computation. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the layers I computed earlier.

So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it without using the formula, just step by step, I could have gone through each layer as I did before, but since there's a pattern, it's more efficient to use the formula once you recognize the recurrence relation.

Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction, but in our computations, all a_n are integers. That suggests that perhaps this approach needs a particular solution. Alternatively, maybe the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. Alternatively, perhaps the closed-form is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches a_3=40. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which matches a_4=121.

Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, if I had noticed the pattern earlier, I could have used the closed-form formula to compute a_9 directly, which might have saved some time. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step isn't too bad. Just to recap, the process was: 1.

After computing the innermost nine layers, multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression. 4. Verify the result using an alternative method, such as solving the recurrence relation, to ensure accuracy. This approach reduces the chance of errors and helps confirm that the answer is correct. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula gave me the same result.

Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

Hmm, but our initial terms are integers, so maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the homogeneous solution is different. Alternatively, since the recurrence is nonhomogeneous, let's solve it step by step. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant K. Plugging into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.

Therefore, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree. Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern immediately, computing each layer step by step is straightforward, though time-consuming. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using this recurrence relation, we compute each layer up to the ninth layer, which results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using both methods, step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form expression, I arrive at the same answer.

Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. As before, 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's the answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The step-by-step approach worked well, and verifying with the closed-form formula gave the same result.

So, left side: A*3^n + B = right side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction. But our initial terms are integers. Let's check if this works. So, a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.

Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Therefore, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.
