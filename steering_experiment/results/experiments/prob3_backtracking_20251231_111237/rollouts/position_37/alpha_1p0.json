    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88,572. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 29524*3=88,572, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's see: Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. For n=1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2: a_2 =13 = A*3^2 + B =9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plug back into the first equation: 4 = (3/2)*3 + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2})/2 -1/2 = 9/2 -1/2=8/2=4, correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = 59,049 /2 -1/2 = (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048 /2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to arrive at the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. So, that seems right. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that would be 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when I see these kinds of nested expressions, they can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or something similar, which might have a formula to compute it without expanding each layer. Maybe that's a quicker way, but since I'm just starting out, I think working step by step is better to avoid mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, that aligns with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. Because sometimes when dealing with recurrences, the indexing can be off. Let me check for n=1, a_1=4, which is correct. n=2, a_2=13, correct. So, the formula seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each a_n is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, each time, it's 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, in terms of the series, it's like a sum of 3^k terms. But since each layer is built upon the previous, it's a bit more involved. But the recurrence approach seems solid.\n\nSo, to recap, I can compute each layer step by step, or use the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which gives me a_9=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, I can compute each layer manually, which I did earlier, and arrived at the same result. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*29524 as follows:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 29524*3 another way. 29524 * 3: 29,524 *3. 29,524*3= (30,000 - 476)*3=90,000 - 1,428=88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. Therefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to find the value of the innermost layer and then compute the entire expression.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine layers, with the outermost layer multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n be the value of the nth layer from the inside. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **Find Closed-Form Formula**: Solving the recurrence, we find a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute Innermost Layer**: For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer and see if I added correctly.

So, writing it all together: 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That matches. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 1+3. Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let's count: The innermost is 1+3, then each time we have 1+3(, so from the innermost to the outermost, how many times does 1+3( occur? Let's see: The expression is written as 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting after the first 3(, we have 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on, until we reach 1+3(1+3). Let me count the number of 1+3( sequences. From the inside out: The innermost is 1+3. Then each layer adds another 1+3( around it. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought. Because from the innermost 1+3, each time you go out, you add another 1+3(...). So, 9 layers in total. So, my calculation up to layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. Therefore, I think my answer is correct. Just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's take a smaller version with fewer layers. For example, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4 Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Then multiply by 3: 3*40 = 120 Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Yes, that matches. So, my method works for a smaller case. Therefore, I'm confident that my step-by-step approach is correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a recurrence relation. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. Then, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I see that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, with L1=4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like Ln = a*Ln-1 + b, the solution is Ln = a^(n) * L0 + b*(a^(n) - 1)/(a - 1), where L0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is Ln = 3*Ln-1 + 1, right? Because each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, comparing to the standard form, a=3, b=1. So, the general solution would be Ln = 3^(n) * L0 + (1)*(3^(n) - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, but our initial term is L1=4, so maybe n starts at 1. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. Let me see: Let's say that L1 = 4. Then, for n >=1, Ln = 3*Ln-1 +1. So, we can write this as Ln = 3*Ln-1 +1, with L1=4. So, to find L9, we can use the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P +1 => P -3P =1 => -2P=1 => P= -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Therefore, L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. So, L9=29524, which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that seems to confirm my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to see this without computing each layer, but I think the step-by-step approach worked well enough, especially since there are only nine layers. It's a bit tedious, but manageable. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric series might help, but in this case, since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's a bit more involved. But using the recurrence relation approach worked out fine. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can work from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step.

Let's break it down: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524. Let me compute that again: 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000*3=60,000, 9,000*3=27,000, 500*3=1,500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. That seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is 4, so a_1=4. Then, a_2=1 + 3*a_1=1 + 12=13. a_3=1 + 3*a_2=1 + 39=40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Given the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and the initial condition a_1=4. Let's plug in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now, we can set up the equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtract equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = (-1)/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, matches a_3=40. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4. Then, each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9, since there are nine layers. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the result is 88,572. I think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So, the total would be 88,572. Hmm, let me verify that because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n, starting from L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we have L_1 = 4, L_2 = 13, L_3 = 40, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the final result is 3*L_9. This recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to find a formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can write it as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, 88,572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with nine layers. Each layer adds a power of 3, so perhaps the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but that's the same as E = 3*(1 + E'), where E' is a similar expression with one fewer layer. Wait, but in our case, we have nine layers, so maybe it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula we found, since L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then E = 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, E = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give the same result.

Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13, 1 + 3*13 = 40, 1 + 3*40 = 121, 1 + 3*121 = 364, 1 + 3*364 = 1093, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions, but since each layer is only two operations deep, it's manageable to compute each step manually. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me see if I can find a pattern in the layers. Let's list the results of each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. Each layer n is equal to 1 + 3*(layer n-1). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This kind of recurrence can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution and particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Just to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me recompute 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I can add 29,524 + 29,524 + 29,524. 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048. 59,048 + 29,524: Let's add 59,048 + 20,000 = 79,048. Then, 79,048 + 9,524 = 88,572. Same result. So, no issues there. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(...), where the innermost is 1+3, and each layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, with nine layers, each adding another 1+3*(...). So, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nEach layer can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be written as:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 88,572, which is correct because 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nBut let me confirm once more using the formula.\n\nSince a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression using the formula without computing each layer, which would be more efficient, especially for larger n. But since n=9 here, computing each layer step by step isn't too bad.\n\nSo, to recap, the expression is a nested set of 1 + 3*(...), nine times, and then multiplied by 3. Using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the value is 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations for any possible arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.

But I'm a bit unsure because the number is so large, but each step seems to be correct. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me think about this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Wait a minute, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution would be a constant, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, L_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems to confirm my earlier result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct because both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach led me to the same result. I don't see any errors in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; 59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers, let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems right. So, I think I did it correctly. But wait, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Let's add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total would be 88,572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering how many layers there are, it might make sense. Let me verify my calculations step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the way I computed it seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without going through each layer, in case I made a mistake in the layers.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, etc.\n\nSo, in general, Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, for n >= 2, and L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln.\n\nThe recursive formula is Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, which is a linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous solution plus particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: characteristic equation is r = 3, so homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P.\n\nSolving for P: P = 1 + 3P => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply initial condition: L1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer n, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1: L1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L9=(3^10 -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*Ln where n=9, so 3*(3^(10)-1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^11: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049; 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Which matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1:1+3, then Layer 2:1+3*(Layer1), up to Layer9:1+3*(Layer8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the formula, I had Ln = (3^(n+1)-1)/2, so for Layer9, it's (3^10 -1)/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the entire expression: 3*Ln = 3*(3^(n+1)-1)/2 = (3^(n+2)-3)/2. For n=9, that's (3^11 -3)/2=88572.\n\nEither way, same result.\n\nJust to make sure, perhaps I can compute a few layers manually to see if the pattern holds. Let's see:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2:1+3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each step is correct.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe denote each layer as \\(L_n\\), where \\(L_1 = 1 + 3\\), and each subsequent layer is computed as \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\cdot L_{n-1}\\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - \\(L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - \\(L_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - \\(L_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - \\(L_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - \\(L_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - \\(L_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - \\(L_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - \\(L_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - \\(L_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n2. The entire expression is \\(3 \\cdot L_9\\). Compute this:\n   - \\(3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1.

It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula to compute it without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^10 is indeed 59,049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2,187, 3^8 is 6,561, 3^9 is 19,683, and 3^10 is 59,049. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. By computing each layer step by step or using the closed-form formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find that the outermost layer (layer 9) equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me verify with another method. Let me compute 29,524 * 3 as (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, I wrote 1093 earlier, but 3*364 is 1,092, so 1 + 1,092 is 1,093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093: 1,000*3=3,000, 93*3=279, so total is 3,279. So, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Let's compute 3*3,280: 3,000*3=9,000, 280*3=840, so total is 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 3*9,841. 9,000*3=27,000, 841*3=2,523. So, 27,000 + 2,523 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, the sequence is a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1,093, a_7=3,280, a_8=9,841, a_9=29,524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, it's correct. Alternatively, I can model this recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant particular solution. Let me try that. Let me assume that the particular solution is a constant, say a_p. Then, substituting into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's another way to confirm the answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can compute each nested layer step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total would be 88,572. Hmm, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer step by step again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; so 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. In this case, c=1 and r=3. The solution to such a recurrence relation is a_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^n - 1) + (a_0*(r - 1))/(r - 1), but I might be misremembering the exact formula. Alternatively, since a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can write it as a_n + k = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + k. Wait, maybe it's easier to solve it by iteration. Let me try expanding the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern. a_1 = 4 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nHmm, each term seems to follow a pattern where a_n = (3^n + 1)/2. Let me test this hypothesis. For n=1: (3^1 + 1)/2 = (3 + 1)/2 = 4/2 = 2. But a_1 is 4, not 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2? Let's check:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nn=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes! So, the general formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Now, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. This confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. I think that's solid now. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer step by step or by recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the nth term of a geometric-like sequence. Both methods lead to the same result. I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). Calculating each layer step by step leads to the final result. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern allows using the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\) for the nth term, which simplifies the computation. Multiplying the outermost term by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)} \\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   Starting from the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count: Starting from the first 1+3, each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see: Starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers because each \"1+3(\" adds a layer, and the last one is 1+3 without any further nesting. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is 1+3, and each layer wraps around that, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term. Let me try to parse this expression correctly. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there?

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is indeed 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 1 + 3. By computing each layer step by step and using a closed-form formula to verify, we find that the final result is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it out: 7 7 8 5 2. Wait, that would be 88572. Hmm, but let me confirm with another method. Let me break down 29524 into parts: 29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then, 3*(20000) = 60000, 3*(9000)=27000, 3*(500)=1500, 3*(20)=60, 3*(4)=12. Now, add all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Okay, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 29524, but when I multiply by 3, I get 88572. But let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step without labeling the layers. Let me try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 =4. Then moving one layer out: 1 +3*(4)=1+12=13. Next layer: 1 +3*(13)=1+39=40. Next: 1 +3*(40)=1+120=121. Next: 1 +3*(121)=1+363=364. Next:1 +3*(364)=1+1092=1093. Next:1 +3*(1093)=1+3279=3280. Next:1 +3*(3280)=1+9840=9841. Next:1 +3*(9841)=1+29523=29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the layers correctly? The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) + 1. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each (1+3) is one layer, and each time we wrap it with another 1+3*(...). So, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+\" appears inside the expression. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: (1+3). Then, moving out, each layer adds another \"1+\".\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of (1+3(...) terms. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3) \u2192 Layer 1\n2. (1+3(Layer1)) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. (1+3(Layer2)) \u2192 Layer3\n4. (1+3(Layer3)) \u2192 Layer4\n5. (1+3(Layer4)) \u2192 Layer5\n6. (1+3(Layer5)) \u2192 Layer6\n7. (1+3(Layer6)) \u2192 Layer7\n8. (1+3(Layer7)) \u2192 Layer8\n9. (1+3(Layer8)) \u2192 Layer9\n10. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers inside the initial 3*(...), so when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have n layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: The innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer is a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms my previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum of a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3 each time, so perhaps there's a way to express the entire expression as a sum.\n\nBut since we've already solved it using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation method, and both give the same result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems solid.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Each layer is adding another power of 3. So, the innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 -1)/2? Wait, no, 4 is (3^2 + 1)/something? Hmm, maybe not. But using the formula we derived earlier, it's (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which for n=1 is (9 -1)/2=4, which matches.\n\nSo, that formula works.\n\nThus, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by using the result from the previous layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9:} & \\quad 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Hmm, but wait, let me check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in the earlier layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting again with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+72=88572. Yes, that seems correct.

So writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. I think that's correct. To make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could have given me this result without computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}.\n\nContinuing this, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}*a_1.\n\nSince a_1 = 4, then a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 4*3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, actually, let me think again. Each step adds a term multiplied by 3^{k}, where k is the number of layers. Let me try to write it out:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with the earlier layers to make sure.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, the value at layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer, 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value at the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093.\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280.\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841.\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct).

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms to see the pattern: a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, from this, we can see that each a_n is 3 times the previous a_{n-1} plus 1. So, the recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\nK - 3*K = 1\n-2*K = 1\nK = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1=4.\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good confirmation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated before.\n\nWait, but let me check 3^{10} again to be absolutely sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the value is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the layers, let me recount them:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Each step follows from the previous one correctly.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result.

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then inside that is 1+3(, and so on. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" after the initial 3(...). Let's see:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, we have 1+3(, then another 1+3(, and so on. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. ...1+3(\n3. ...1+3(\n4. ...1+3(\n5. ...1+3(\n6. ...1+3(\n7. ...1+3(\n8. ...1+3(\n9. ...1+3(\n10. ...1+3)\n\nWait, that can't be right because the initial count was 9 layers, but now I'm seeing 10. Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the outermost 3(...), the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of 1 + 3(...) sections.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me write the expression out without the initial 3:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nNow, let's count the number of \"1+3(\" inside this.\n\nEach time we have \"1 + 3(\", which is 9 times, because starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, perhaps there are 9 layers, each adding a 1 + 3(...). So, that would mean that Layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3), then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9 being the outermost, which is then multiplied by the initial 3. So, in that case, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should try computing each layer again to confirm.\n\nLet me list each layer with their computed values:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, perhaps the answer is 88,572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. Let's model this.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost as a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, a_9 = 29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of recurrence relation. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, after verifying with the recurrence relation and solving it using the formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous value. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final value of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.

Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, +240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.

Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nThe next digit is 2, which is in the ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6, write down 6.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 6 (from 2*3), then 8 (from 2*3 + carryover 2), then 8 (from 9*3 +1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 +1), then 2 (from 4*3). So, 68572? Wait, no, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Write down 8.\n\nThe next digit is 2 (the ten thousands place): 2 * 3 = 6. So, writing it all together: 6 (from 2*3), then 8 (from 2*3 + 2 carried over), then 8 (from 9*3 +1), then 5 (from 5*3), then 7 (from 2*3 +1), then 2 (from 4*3). So, the result is 68,572? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 29524 * 3 is actually 88,572. Let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n----------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.

Okay, so I think I messed up the placement earlier. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another method. 29,524 * 3 can be broken down as:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because sometimes when you have so many layers, it's easy to make an error in one of the steps. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is correctly calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^{1} + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nAlso, for n=2, a_2 =13.\n\n13 = A*3^{2} + B => 13 = 9A + B.\n\nNow, subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B)\n\n9 = 6A\n\nSo, A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nThen, plug A back into the first equation:\n\n4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, which can be expressed as a geometric series.\n\nBut since I already have the closed-form, and it's verified, I can be confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing one more layer manually to see if the pattern holds.\n\nFor example, let's compute a_4 using the formula: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I'm solid here. The answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number.

So, I think my final answer is 88,572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote the layers as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2. Then, the sequence is a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. For n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the equation: (A*3^{n} + B) - 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1.\n\nSimplify: A*3^{n} + B - 3A*3^{n-1} - 3B = 1.\n\nSince 3^{n} = 3*3^{n-1}, so 3A*3^{n-1} = A*3^{n}.\n\nSo, the equation becomes: A*3^{n} + B - A*3^{n} - 3B = 1 => (-2B) = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nThen, using the initial condition a_1 = 3A + B = 4.\n\nWe have B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works.

Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct.

So, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is similar to a geometric series, but it's a bit different because each term is built from the previous one. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n. Let's define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, as I computed earlier, a_9 =29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. Then, the solution to this recurrence can be found. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's find B. Assume a particular solution is a constant, B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1= (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we're dealing with a_9, which is the 9th layer, n=9. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, a_9=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, we can write it as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to get to the answer. So, regardless of the method, the result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. To make sure, let me try computing a few layers again to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer1:1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer3:1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer4:1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer5:1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer6:1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer7:1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer8:1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer9:1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems consistent. So, I think I've arrived at the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because that seems like a large number, and I might have made an error in multiplying or adding. Let me verify each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial step because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(Layer 9). But in my initial thought process, I computed Layer 9 as 29,524 and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me check if the number of layers is correct. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Starting from the inside: Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them: 1. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, each time I see \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the initial 3(, there are 9 more \"1+3(\" instances, each nested inside. Wait, no. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first one is 3(1+3(...)), so inside that, there's another 1+3(...), and so on. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let's parse the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer wraps another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" segments. Each time I see a \"(\", I can count a new layer. Let me write it out step by step:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Then, the next layer: 1 + 3*(previous layer)\n3. Repeating until the outermost.\n\nBut how many layers exactly? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer.

Let me write out the expression with indices:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer 9)\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there?

So, perhaps the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, and each outer layer adds another 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, if there are 9 layers, then Layer 9 would be the outermost one before the initial 3. Therefore, the initial 3 is multiplied by Layer 9. So, in my earlier computation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me confirm the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the expression. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"(\":\n\nStarting from the left: 3( ... So, each \"(\" introduces a new layer.\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n10. 1+3)\n\nWait, but that's 10 \"(\", but the expression ends with a single \")\", so perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me think differently. Each \"1+3(\" introduces a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" instances, which is 9. Therefore, Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my initial computation was correct, with Layer 9 being 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. However, let me check again the computations for each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of them.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 88,572 seems quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. Let me verify each computation again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400. 29,400 + 120 = 29,520. 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524: Let's compute that. 29,524 * 3.\n\nCompute 20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n24 * 3 = 72.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524\n\n\u00d7        3\n\n_________\n\nCompute from right to left:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's a bit different. Let me see if I can find a recursive formula or a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, we can express this recursively as:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is:\n\nL_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation of Layer 9 as 29,524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can confirm that the result is indeed 88,572. This method is much faster and reduces the chance of arithmetic errors.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me double-check each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, all layers compute correctly, and the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let me see. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no. Wait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, as computed earlier. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, the general solution for such a recurrence relation is a linear function. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer adds another 3 multiplied by the previous term. So, the total expression can be seen as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try to express the entire expression as a sum. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(previous sum). So, maybe the entire expression can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. Wait, let's see. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Let's see how many terms there are. Each time we add a layer, we multiply by 3 and add 1. So, after 9 layers, it's 3*(Layer 9). But perhaps E can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), but with 9 layers. Alternatively, using the formula I found earlier, E = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, because E = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which again matches my previous result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or express it as a geometric series, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the different methods all lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by computing each layer starting from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when I did the layers, each time I was multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which seems like a pattern that might have a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe there's a more efficient way to compute this without having to go through each layer, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nWait, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\nD - 3*D = 1\n-2D = 1\nD = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet's compute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually. That's reassuring.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572, as I calculated before.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, the number of layers is 9, which corresponds to n = 9 in the recurrence. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2.\n\nFor n = 9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n3^11 = 3*59049 = 177147\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nThat's the same result as before. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3=4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. This seems like a geometric sequence or something that can be modeled recursively. Let me define a recursive formula. Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, using the recursive formula and the closed-form solution both lead me to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me check my calculations again. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check because sometimes when I do mental math, I might make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000, and then subtract (30,000 - 29,524) * 3. Wait, 30,000 - 29,524 = 476. So, 476 * 3 = 1,428. Therefore, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go through the layers again to confirm each step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as each layer, then L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, and so on. I wonder if this sequence has a closed-form formula or if it's related to a geometric series. Let's see: Each term is 1 + 3*previous term. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume L_n^p = C, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1: L1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's verify this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, Layer9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression as a geometric series, since each layer is multiplied by 3, but the initial terms are added. Wait, maybe not exactly a geometric series, but it's a linear recurrence. But since we've already found a closed-form formula, I think that's the most efficient way. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\). Solving this recurrence, we derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer, which is \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this formula for the 9th layer and then multiplying by 3, we arrive at the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let's see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, whose solution is L_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... up to a certain power. Wait, let's see: If I expand the innermost expression, each layer adds another power of 3. Let me try expanding a few layers to see the pattern. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 3^2. Wait, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Yes, that's correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 = 40. Correct. Similarly, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121. Yes, that's the sum of a geometric series from 3^0 to 3^4. So, in general, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. Wait, but in our case, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = sum from k=0 to k=1 of 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2 is 1 + 3 + 9 = sum from k=0 to k=2 of 3^k = 13. So, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, so S = (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which matches the formula I derived earlier. Therefore, Layer 9 is the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, which is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, using the geometric series approach also confirms the result. I think I've confirmed it enough ways, so I'm pretty confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that might not be the correct answer because 3*(1 + 3*(...)) nine times seems like a lot, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1. 3(1+3(...)) So, each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count them: The innermost is the 9th layer, then moving outwards, it's 8, 7, etc., up to the first layer. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me try to see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances. Starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 1 + 3( adds a new layer. So, from the first 3, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(\", which would mean 9 layers. So, my earlier calculation with 9 layers is correct. So, the computation should be correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way. Alternatively, I can notice that this expression is a form of a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. To solve this, I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so a = 3, b = 1. So, the general solution would be L_n = 3^{n} * L_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, our initial term is L_1 = 4, so we need to adjust the formula accordingly. Let me see. Actually, for n >=1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found by assuming L_n^{(p)} = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recursive formula and a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Using a closed-form formula, we determine that the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Wait, that's the same as before. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. Okay, so I didn't make a mistake there. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That checks out too. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if this forms a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nWait a second, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B.\n\nWe can find another equation by considering the homogeneous solution and particular solution. Alternatively, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things because we're dealing with integers here. Maybe it's better to compute a few terms and see the pattern.\n\nWait, let's compute L_1 to L_9:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 13\n\nL_3 = 40\n\nL_4 = 121\n\nL_5 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term seems to be one less than a power of 3. Let me check:\n\n3^3 = 27; 27 - 1 = 26 \u2260 4\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps they relate to (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let's test that.\n\nFor L_1: n=1: (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL_9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWow, that's a neat pattern! So, each layer L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. That's a useful formula. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, which is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and recognizing the pattern with the formula, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that 88,572 is the correct result.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and work from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, ensuring each multiplication and addition is correct.\n\n3. Alternatively, recognize the recurrence relation and find a closed-form formula to compute the result more efficiently.\n\nBoth methods led to the same final answer, so I'm pretty sure that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested structure and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the layers correctly? The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 9 would be the outermost one before the initial 3. So, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me see. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, perhaps it's easier to solve it iteratively since it's only 9 terms. Alternatively, the closed-form formula for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = k^n*a_0 + d*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, in this case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, right? Because each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me check that. For n=1, a_1=4. For n=2, a_2=1 + 3*4=13, which matches. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. To find a general formula, let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, which matches. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which matches. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for the innermost layer, which is Layer 1: n=1, a_1=4. Layer 2: n=2, a_2=13, etc., up to Layer 9: n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute a_9: 3^{10}=59,049. So, a_9=(59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches the Layer 9 value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative approach and the recurrence relation method led me to the same result.
