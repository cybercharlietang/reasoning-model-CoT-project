Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Alternatively, I can do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 2*3=6. So, writing it together: 6, 8, 5, 8, 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 properly. 29524 * 3: Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carry 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it together: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 *3 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, but I want to make sure that I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate any step. Let me recount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 +3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 +3*(previous layer). So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my calculation seems correct. Let me just verify one more time by computing each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 +3 =4. Layer 2:1 +3*4=13. Layer3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that's consistent. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is calculated until reaching the outermost layer. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Compute the innermost parentheses:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made an error in multiplying 3 * 29524. Alternatively, I can compute it directly: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7.

Let's go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, that's Layer 1. Each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, yes, nine layers in total, ending with Layer 9 as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm feeling a bit uncertain because the numbers are growing so rapidly. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let's think about this expression. It's a nested expression where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works for the first few layers. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm correctly applying the formula. The original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the 9th layer. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. Let me see: The entire expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 59049*3 = 177147.\n\nThus, the expression is (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, using the formula, I get the same answer without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient and less error-prone.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just write that in the required format.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step or using a recurrence relation formula, we find the final value is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods agree.

Alternatively, if there were more layers, maybe I could find a pattern or a formula, but with nine, it's feasible to compute each one. So, in summary, starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and after computing up to the ninth layer, I multiply that result by 3 to get the final answer.

So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. I think I did each step right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which results in 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But just to be thorough, let me compute Layer 9 again step by step. Starting from Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, this confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. Let me try that. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few terms. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 =40, which matches a_3=40. Perfect, the formula works. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. Since the original expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Yep, that's another way to get the same result. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that this is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer up to the ninth one. Then, we multiply the ninth layer by 3 to get the final result. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go back through each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524 * 3. Break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8.\nSo, putting it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This looks like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me rewrite it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads me to the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88,572 is the correct result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but since it's nested nine times, it's essentially a geometric series, but with a twist because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to the next. But since I already have the closed-form formula, that's probably the most efficient way. Anyway, I think I've double-checked enough. The final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Let me verify this multiplication another way. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it using a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Looking at the layers, each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Layer n. The recurrence relation is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p(n) = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 =88572. So, using the formula also gives me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{expression})\\).

Hmm, that seems pretty big, but given the number of layers, it makes sense. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct) Okay, that seems right. Each step checks out, so I think I did this correctly. I was a bit worried about the size of the numbers, but since each layer multiplies by 3 and adds 1, the numbers grow exponentially, so it's expected that the final result is quite large. I guess another way to think about this is that each layer is following the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. If I can express this as a geometric series, maybe I can find a closed-form solution instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Expanding this, we get: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on. To solve this recurrence relation, we can write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since the innermost layer is layer 1, and we have 9 layers), the value is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So that's a good check. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I think I've got it. The answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n\n1.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = -1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let me write it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, layer n has value (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so its value is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.

Hmm, but wait, let me check my calculations again because I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't mess up any numbers. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiply that by 3: 3 * 29524. Let me compute this carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 +12=88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because when I first saw the problem, I thought it might have a pattern or a formula that could simplify it without computing each layer step by step. Let me think if there's a better way, maybe using geometric series or something. Let me consider the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for a_n. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's write out the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th term, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute it using the formula instead of step by step. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try computing it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Specifically, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n instead of computing each term step by step. Let me try that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C \u2192 0 = 1 + 2C \u2192 C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A \u2192 9/2 = 3A \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it as 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me check that.\n\n3^{11} = 3^10 *3 = 59049 *3 = 177147.\n\nSo (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo whether I compute each layer step by step or find a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods led me to the same place. So I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Yeah, that seems correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or count them wrong. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) sections. Let me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 appears, each time wrapped in another 3(...). Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), that's 1.\n- Then each layer adds another 1+3(...).

Let me compute that again just to be sure.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me do it digit by digit.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\nDigit positions: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying each by 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nSo, reading from right to left, the digits are 2,7,5,8,8.\n\nWait, that would be 88572. Wait, but when I write it down, it's 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 88572. I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let's see.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I also get 88572. That confirms my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the recurrence a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nIf I expand this, a_2=1+3*4=13\n\na_3=1+3*(1+3*4)=1 +3 + 9*4=1 +3 +36=40\n\nWait, but that's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nIndeed, the general solution I found earlier is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from n=1.\n\nTherefore, the sum S = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n, but in this case, each a_n is built upon the previous, so it's a linear recurrence rather than a sum.\n\nBut regardless, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives us the value at each layer n.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't find any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the recurrence relation method give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4.

Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this pattern as a geometric series or something, but given the way it's nested, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, it's like each layer is a term in a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 4, as we saw. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => Subtract a_p from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => 2*a_p = -1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, right? Because starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: a_1 = 4, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost before multiplying by 3. So, Layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, both methods give me the same result.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a layer, which would throw off all the subsequent ones. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 (as before). Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be faster or more efficient. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, which reminds me of a geometric series or perhaps something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say a_n represents the value of the nth layer. So, starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard method to solve this is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Seems like the formula works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, right? Because 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula, which is more efficient, especially if n were larger. But since n=9, computing each layer step by step wasn't too bad, but having a formula is useful for future reference or for larger n. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the value efficiently. Applying this formula, we determine that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recursive relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, a_1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on up to a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous part: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nSo, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of order 1.\n\nThe standard solution method is to find the homogeneous solution and then a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1.\n\nSolve for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2.\n\nSolve for C: 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so using the formula, I can compute it more directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which is efficient. But since I already computed each layer step by step and got the same result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 27? Wait, no, wait, let me do it properly.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\n2 9 5 2 4\n\nSo, 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.

By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4, we derive a closed-form formula for a_n, which simplifies the computation. Applying this formula, we determine that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

But just to be thorough, let me compute 29524 \u00d7 3 in another way.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 can be thought of as (30000 - 476) \u00d7 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can help avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if there are many layers. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, which can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p:\n\na_p - 3*a_p = 1\n\n-2*a_p = 1\n\na_p = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, with the innermost being layer 1 (n=1) and the outermost being layer 9 (n=9). Wait, but in our original problem, the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3^{10}.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, 3^{10} = 59049\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer follows a geometric progression, since each term is multiplied by 3 each time, the sum can be expressed as a geometric series. But in this case, since each term is nested within the previous one, it's a bit more involved, but the recurrence relation approach worked well.\n\nJust to recap, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation to avoid errors.\n\n3. Realize that the recurrence relation could be solved with a formula, which was then applied to find the value of the outermost layer.\n\n4. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n5. Verify the result using an alternative method (the recurrence formula) to ensure correctness.\n\nSo, after carefully working through the problem, double-checking each step, and confirming with a different approach, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows us to use a formula to find the value efficiently. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. So a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) another similar expression.

So, yes, 88,572 is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them.

So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about whether there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which matches what I did earlier. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating things since we only have nine layers. However, for future reference, the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, how many layers do we have? The original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3(...), so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's another way to approach it, using the formula for the linear recurrence. But since the problem only has nine layers, it's manageable to compute each step manually. However, knowing the formula is useful for future problems with more layers. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step or by using the formula for the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88,572. I think that's correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to see if there's a quicker way to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one.

So, this is a geometric progression, but with an added constant each time. Wait, actually, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can express this recurrence relation in a general form. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, yes, that's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without manually calculating each layer. That's pretty cool. So, the key insight here was recognizing that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. That saved me a lot of time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there were only nine layers, it wasn't too bad either way. Anyway, after computing each step carefully and verifying with the formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from 4, then 13, then 40, etc. Each time, it's tripling the previous result and adding 1. Let me see if that's a geometric series or something that can be expressed in a formula. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see the sequence:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. I think this is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9, it would be (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost layer is 29,524, and then we multiply by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and start from the innermost parentheses.\n2. Compute each layer step by step, each time tripling the previous result and adding 1.\n3. Alternatively, derive a closed-form formula using recurrence relations to find Layer 9 more efficiently.\n4. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nYes, that seems solid. I don't think I made any calculation errors, especially since I double-checked the multiplication and the recurrence formula. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Then, 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it directly: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.
