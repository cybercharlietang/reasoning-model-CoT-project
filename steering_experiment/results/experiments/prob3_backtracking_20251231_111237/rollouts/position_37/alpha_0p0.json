    "text": " Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3 * 9000 = 27000, 3 * 500 = 1500, 3 * 24 = 72. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it properly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, carryover 0. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So writing it out: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carryover 0. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So putting it all together, 29524 *3=88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in the carryover. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as follows: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000=79048, 79048 +9000=88048, 88048 +524=88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer because I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 =1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, the computation seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me see if that's the case. Let me denote each term as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1=1+3=4. a_2=1+3a_1=1+3*4=13. a_3=1+3a_2=1+3*13=40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} -1)/(k-1), where a_0 is the initial term. In this case, our recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} +1. So, k=3, c=1. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The general solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (3^{n} -1)/(3-1). But wait, in our case, a_1=4. Let me check: For n=1, a_1=4. Using the formula: a_1=3^1 * a_0 + (3^1 -1)/(3-1). Let's solve for a_0: 4=3*a_0 + (3 -1)/2 => 4=3a_0 +1. So, 3a_0=3 => a_0=1. That makes sense because a_1=1+3=4, so a_0 would be 1, which is the initial term before the first application of the recurrence. So, the general formula for a_n is: a_n = 3^n *1 + (3^{n} -1)/2. Simplifying, a_n = 3^n + (3^n -1)/2 = (2*3^n +3^n -1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as starting with 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*a_9. So, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3, resulting in the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I just had to remember to compute each layer one at a time and not get overwhelmed by the number of parentheses. It's interesting how each layer grows exponentially because of the multiplication by 3 each time. So, each subsequent layer is significantly larger than the previous one, which is why the numbers get so big quickly.

    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute this: 29,524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.

Hmm, but let me check the multiplication again just to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nNo more digits, so the result is 88,572. Yes, that matches. So, I think I did it right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a recursive pattern where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nGiven that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the general formula gives me the same result as computing each layer step by step. That makes me more confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach term is 1 + 3*(something). If I expand the entire expression, it's going to be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be represented as a sum of 3^n terms. But since each layer is multiplied by 3 and adds 1, it's not a straightforward geometric series, but rather a recursive one.\n\nBut using the recurrence relation approach worked well, so I think that's the way to go.\n\nLet me just recap what I did:\n\n1. Recognized the nested structure of the expression, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n2. Computed each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9.\n\n3. Multiplied the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n4. Verified the result using a recurrence relation approach, which confirmed the same answer.\n\nTherefore, I'm pretty sure that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Wait, but I just thought of something. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. To find a closed-form solution, perhaps I can solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier by computing each layer manually. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524. So, the final result is 3*29524=88572. Wait, but let me confirm once more because it's easy to make a mistake with exponents. 3^10 is indeed 59049, yes. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I can think of this as the expression being a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. But in this case, since it's a finite number of terms, specifically 9 layers, the formula I used earlier is more appropriate. So, to summarize, by computing each layer step by step or by finding a closed-form solution using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result: 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach to solving such equations is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, so the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. So, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 3*121=363. Then 1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer6: 3*364=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer7: 3*1093=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:3*3280=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Each step follows logically, and I didn't skip any layers. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time helps prevent mistakes. I guess another way to think about this is that each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the result of the previous layer. So, each time, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. That's similar to a geometric series, but since each term is defined based on the previous one, it's more like a recursive sequence. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of expression. If I have a term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent term is defined by that recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few terms. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. So, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier result using a different method. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same answer. I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula approach led me to the same result. Plus, I double-checked each step in my initial computation, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering the multiple layers of multiplication, it might make sense.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. We know that L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Let me substitute L_n = A*3^n + B into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = A*3^n + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.

Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if there's a closed-form formula. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's non-homogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution to such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n = 1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n = 1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n = 9 (since there are 9 layers from the innermost to the outermost), L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. I think that's solid. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the innermost value, then worked my way out, multiplying by 3 at the end. Additionally, by recognizing the recurrence relation, I found a closed-form formula which confirmed my step-by-step computation.

Let me count the number of 1+3( inside the expression: The first 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first 3, each layer adds a 1+3(, and I think there are 9 such layers. Wait, let me check: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds a 1+3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each time we go out, we add another 1+3*(previous layer). So, total layers would be 9, right? Because the expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(... 9 times ... ))) So, if I have 9 layers, then my calculation up to Layer 9 being 29524, then multiplied by 3, giving 88572, should be correct. But let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution. a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the left side is A*3^n + B, and the right side is A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Correct. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each layer again to double-check. Let me list each a_n from 1 to 9: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Then, 3*a9=88572. So, all steps check out. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 by breaking it down:\n\n29,524 = 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24\nSo, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n24 * 3 = 72\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that matches. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing any of the layers. It's easy to have an arithmetic error in one of the steps, which would throw off the entire result.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Wait, hold on, 3*364 is 1,092, right? So, 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. But earlier, I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. So that's correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093. 1,000*3=3,000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. So, 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. 3,000*3=9,000, 280*3=840. So, 9,000 + 840 = 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Let's compute 3*9,841. 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which we already computed as 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term.\n\nWe can write this as a recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation:\n\nC = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then:\n\n3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same final answer.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods confirm that the result is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value and substitute it into the next.

Compute the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Substitute into the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition. For n=1, L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let me also compute L_2 to find another equation. L_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, I have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substituting A back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula for L_n is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each time, the expression is multiplied by 3 and adds 1. So, starting from the innermost layer, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I have n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. That seems solid. Let me just confirm the exponent. Since we start with L_1 = 4, which is (3^2 -1)/2, so for L_n, it's (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, it's 3^{10} -1 over 2, which is correct. So, yeah, I think 88,572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let's do it step by step: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29,524 *3=88,572. Wait, let me check that again: 29,524 *3: 4*3=12, so 2 carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8 carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error in any of them. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Maybe I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's define a sequence where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, if I can find a general formula for an, that would be helpful. Let's see: a1 = 4\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the same as before. Therefore, the expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let's define an = 1 + 3*an-1, with a1 = 4. Then, solving this recurrence relation might give a closed-form expression. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving an - 3*an-1 = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is an = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4. So, when n=1, a1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is an = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, an = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, a9 = 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4.

Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me compute that. 3 * 29524. Well, 3 * 29,000 is 87,000. Then, 3 * 524 is 1,572. So, adding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572. Wait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8; 9*3=27, carryover 2; 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; and 9*3=27, carryover 2; but wait, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. But according to the general solution, a_n should also equal A*3^n + B. Therefore, setting the two expressions equal: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88,572.

Let's break it down: 3 * 20000 = 60000 3 * 9000 = 27000 3 * 500 = 1500 3 * 24 = 72 Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading it from top to bottom: 8,7,8,5,7,2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I messed up the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 0.\nThere are no more digits, so write down the final carry over if any, but in this case, it's 0.\n\nSo putting it together: 8 7 8 5 7 2? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 \u00d7 3 is 88572, which is what I got earlier. Wait, but when I did the digit-by-digit, I think I made a mistake in the order. Let me try again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carry 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carry 0.\nSo the digits are 8 (from the 2\u00d73+carry), 7 (from 5\u00d73), 8 (from 9\u00d73), 7 (from 2\u00d73), and 2 (from 4\u00d73). Wait, that doesn't make sense because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when multiplied by 3, it should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7   3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0.\nSo the result is 88572, which is a 5-digit number. So yes, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I computed each layer correctly because if any of those layers was wrong, the final answer would be off. Let me go through each layer again to verify:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial problem again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...). The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, inside the first 3(...), there's another 3(...), and so on, until the innermost 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts. Each time, it's 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that: 3(1+3(...))\n3. Repeating until the innermost 1+3.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each time we have another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears as the innermost part.\n\nLooking at the problem again: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 sections:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3 \u2192 Layer 1\n2. Next layer: 1+3(1+3) \u2192 Layer 2\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3)) \u2192 Layer 3\n4. Continue until Layer 9, which is the outermost 1+3(...), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had Layer 1 to Layer 9, each being 1+3*(previous layer). So that would mean 9 layers, each computed as above. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive formula. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nNow, equate both sides:\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n-2B = 1\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nPlugging n=1 into the general solution:\nL_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^{10} is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using the formula.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E = 3*(L_9), where L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, E = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nBecause 3*(3^{10}) = 3^{11} and 3*1=3, so E = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, E = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572 \u2192 Same result.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, I'll recompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 177147 -3 =177144, divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again manually to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3:3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, all steps check out. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to approach this might be to recognize that each layer is a geometric progression. Since each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1, it's similar to a geometric series with a ratio of 3 and a constant addition of 1 each time. The formula I derived earlier, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, is a direct result of that.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write this as a sum, it might look like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, and the number of terms is related to the number of layers. But since I've already confirmed the answer through multiple methods, I think it's safe to conclude that 88572 is the correct solution.\n\nI guess the key takeaway here is that when faced with a nested expression like this, it's helpful to break it down into smaller, manageable parts by starting from the innermost layer and working outward. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation also helps in finding a closed-form solution, which can save a lot of time instead of computing each layer step by step. However, in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula for future reference.\n\nI also learned that it's important to verify each step, especially when dealing with multiple layers of computation. A small mistake in one layer can propagate through all subsequent layers, leading to an incorrect final answer. So, taking the time to double-check each step is well worth it.\n\nOverall, this problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns that can be modeled with recurrence relations. It also reinforced the importance of careful computation and verification.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By breaking down the expression from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows us to derive a closed-form solution, confirming each step's correctness. The final computation results in the value 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). Starting from the innermost term, we work outward.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n   - **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication:**\n   Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{88572}"

Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have saved me from computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe it's better to solve it as a nonhomogeneous recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10. 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my previous calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the steps I took, and the formula approach also led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to find the value of the ninth layer, which is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Because computing nine layers manually is time-consuming and prone to error.

The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since this is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence, maybe we can find a pattern or a direct formula.\n\nAlternatively, since each term is built by multiplying the previous term by 3 and adding 1, we can represent this as:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n\nWhich can be expanded as:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(Layer n-2)) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(Layer n-2)\n\nContinuing this expansion, we get:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*(Layer 0)\n\nAssuming Layer 0 is 1 (the innermost term is Layer 1: 1 + 3, so maybe Layer 0 is 1?), let's check:\n\nIf Layer 1 = 1 + 3*Layer 0, and Layer 1 is 4, then 4 = 1 + 3*Layer 0 \u2192 Layer 0 = 1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, Layer n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k} + 3^{n+1} * Layer 0, but since Layer 0 is 1, it's actually Layer n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k} + 3^{n+1}.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. Each Layer n is built by adding 1 and 3 times the previous layer. So, expanding Layer n:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(Layer n-2))\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(Layer n-2)\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*(Layer n-3))\n= 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*(Layer n-3)\n...\nContinuing this way, we end up with Layer n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k} + 3^{n+1}*(Layer 0)\n\nSince Layer 0 = 1, it becomes Layer n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k} + 3^{n+1}*(1)\n\nBut wait, that would be Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 + 3^{n+1} = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 + 2*(3^{n+1})/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1 + 2*3^{n+1})/2 = (3*3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that again. The sum of a geometric series sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k} is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 + 3^{n+1}*(1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 + 3^{n+1} = [ (3^{n+1} - 1) + 2*3^{n+1} ] / 2 = (3^{n+1} - 1 + 2*3^{n+1}) / 2 = (3*3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me test it with n=1:\n\nLayer 1 should be 4. Using the formula: (3^{1+2} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which is not 4. So, my formula must be wrong. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let's try another approach.\n\nLet me compute the first few layers using the formula and see where I went wrong.\n\nCompute Layer 1: 1 + 3*Layer 0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and the final answer is 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for Layer n is (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test that.\n\nFor Layer 1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, which is not 4. So that's wrong.\n\nWait, maybe it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's try Layer 1: (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which is correct.\n\nLayer 2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, correct.\n\nLayer 3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40, correct.\n\nLayer 4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 121, correct.\n\nLayer 5: (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 364, correct.\n\nLayer 6: (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 1093, correct.\n\nLayer 7: (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 3280, correct.\n\nLayer 8: (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 9841, correct.\n\nLayer 9: (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the formula for Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nThis confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct, and using the formula also gives the same result.\n\nSo, to summarize, by recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can compute each layer efficiently without manually calculating each step, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the formula for future reference.\n\nI think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step method and the formula approach led me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, which is 1 + 3\u00d79841. Let me check that calculation too.\n\nLayer 8 is 9,841. So, Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo, 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm just a bit unsure because the problem is written with nine layers, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3 the next layer. So, perhaps there's a formula for this kind of expression. Let me think.\n\nThis looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, the expression would be 3*a_9.\n\nWait, but in our case, we have nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's try that.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, yes, that matches what I did earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach time, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3)\n\nThen each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let me count them:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each \"1+3(\" is a new layer, and there are 9 such layers, each adding another 3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, which is multiplied by the initial 3.\n\nTherefore, the calculation up to a_9 = 29,524 is correct, and then 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let's see.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p.\n\nPlugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => 0 = 1 + 2*a_p => a_p = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, for a_9, it would be:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, as before.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm 3^10 is indeed 59,049. Let me compute 3^10 step by step:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19,683\n3^10 = 59,049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, using the closed-form solution, I can compute a_9 as (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check once more because sometimes when I'm dealing with exponents, I might make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 3^10 in another way. Let's see:\n\n3^5 = 243\n3^10 = (3^5)^2 = 243^2.\n\nCompute 243^2:\n\n243 \u00d7 243. Let's compute this:\n\nFirst, 200 \u00d7 200 = 40,000\n200 \u00d7 40 = 8,000\n200 \u00d7 3 = 600\n40 \u00d7 200 = 8,000\n40 \u00d7 40 = 1,600\n40 \u00d7 3 = 120\n3 \u00d7 200 = 600\n3 \u00d7 40 = 120\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\nWait, no, that's not the right way. Alternatively, use the standard multiplication:\n\n243\n\u00d7243\n------\n243 \u00d7 3 = 729\n243 \u00d7 40 = 9,720\n243 \u00d7 200 = 48,600\nNow, add them up:\n\n729\n+9,720 = 10,449\n+48,600 = 59,049\n\nYes, so 243^2 = 59,049. Therefore, 3^10 = 59,049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing 3*29,524, I got 88,572, which seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that 29,524 \u00d7 3 is indeed 88,572.\n\nLet me compute 29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n4. (1 + 3(...))\n5. (1 + 3(...))\n6. (1 + 3(...))\n7. (1 + 3(...))\n8. (1 + 3(...))\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nYes, that's nine layers, each adding another 3*(...). So, a_9 is the outermost layer, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9.\n\nTherefore, the computation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to compute each layer step by step, but in this case, since the problem isn't too large, computing each layer step by step is manageable.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can see the pattern in the a_n values:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 13\na_3 = 40\na_4 = 121\na_5 = 364\na_6 = 1093\na_7 = 3280\na_8 = 9841\na_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, each a_n is 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nWait, that's the recurrence relation we had earlier: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nYes, so each term is three times the previous term plus one.\n\nSo, using this, we can compute each term step by step, which we did.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see how many multiplications by 3 happen at each layer. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), we can represent the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*1 + 3*3 = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nThen, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3*1 + 3*3 + 3*9 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nWait a minute, this seems like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nSo, perhaps the entire expression, when expanded, is a sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^k, where k is the number of layers minus one.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nSo, each layer adds another term of 3^{n} where n is the layer number.\n\nTherefore, Layer n would be the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, but wait, no, because Layer 1 is 1 + 3^1, which is sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k, which is (3^2 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 2 is sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k = (3^3 - 1)/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nSo, in general, Layer m is the sum from k=0 to m of 3^k, which is (3^{m+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have nine layers, so the outermost layer would be Layer 9, which is the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k) = 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k is a geometric series with ratio 3, so the sum is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, in this case, n=9, so sum is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524, and 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 once more:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k = (3^10 - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just compute 3*29,524 one more time to be absolutely sure.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after all these computations and checks, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\):\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Wait, but let me check Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9841*3. Let me compute that: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Yeah, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here, recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each time you add 1 and then multiply by 3. This seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a function of the previous term. Let me denote the nth layer as L_n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, we can write this recurrence relation as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*L_9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be written as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution, L_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the answer is correct. Alternatively, since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. This method is faster because it uses the formula instead of computing each layer step by step. However, since I was able to compute each layer manually without error, both methods lead to the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, from Layer 1 to Layer 9. 3. After computing Layer 9, multiply by 3 to get the final result. 4. Verify each computation to ensure accuracy. 5. Realize that the recurrence relation can be solved with a formula, which gives the same result as step-by-step computation. 6. Alternatively, express the entire expression in terms of 3^{11} and compute directly. 7. Both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. So, I think I've covered all the necessary steps and checked my work in multiple ways. I don't see any errors in my reasoning or computations. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test this. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1 corresponds to Layer 1: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is n=9, would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I can also check with a smaller number of layers to see if the formula holds. For example, if there was only one layer: 3*(1+3) =3*4=12. Using the formula: n=1, a_1=4, then 3*a_1=12, correct. If there are two layers: 3*(1+3*(1+3))=3*(1+3*4)=3*(1+12)=3*13=39. Using the formula: a_2=13, 3*a_2=39, correct. So the formula works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for n=9. Therefore, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, this results in 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. That matches my earlier result. So, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss any layers. I started from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then multiplied by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, let me check a couple of the layers again. For example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: As before, 29524*3 = 88572. So, all the steps check out.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.

So, the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series, perhaps? Let me try to model it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... And so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Now, let's see if we can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, using the formula approach, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the computed value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

So, I think my answer is correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have given me the answer without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nGiven a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nThe homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe standard approach is to solve the homogeneous equation and then find a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\na_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\na_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\na_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\na_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\na_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works for all layers. Therefore, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 to find a_9 directly.\n\nGiven that, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, I arrive at the same result.\n\nJust to ensure that I didn't make a mistake in the exponent when using the formula, let me confirm: For a_n, the formula is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9, so it's 3^{10} - 1 over 2. 3^10 is indeed 59049, so 59049 - 1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, after computing, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way, perhaps by expanding the entire expression algebraically. Let me try that.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as E:\n\nE = 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving outwards, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, as we saw, E1 = 1 + 3*E, E2 = 1 + 3*E1, etc.\n\nBut since we've already computed this step by step and confirmed with the formula, I think it's safe to say that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expression using the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to nine layers. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, each layer is a term in a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nBut since each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, it's a bit more involved than a simple geometric series. However, the formula we derived earlier effectively turns it into a geometric series.\n\nGiven that, I think the approach we took is solid.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Wait, but I'm not sure if it's a geometric series because each term is nested. Alternatively, since I found a closed-form formula using the recurrence, maybe that's the most straightforward way. Either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same result. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the nested expression: \n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$.\n\nTo solve this, we recognize the pattern and compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1.

Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - $3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost, then:\n\nL_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to model this recursion.\n\nLet\u2019s define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution will be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nThus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, each layer L_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9.\n\nSo, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the outermost layer is (3^{10} - 1)/2, and the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}:\n\n3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 3*59049 = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times ...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, with nine layers, Layer 9 is the outermost, which is then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, actually, when I counted the layers, I started with Layer 1 as the innermost, and each subsequent layer adds one more 3*(...). So, with nine layers, the outermost is Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer9. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the expression as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step adds another 3*(...).\n\nThus, with nine layers, as I computed, leading to E = 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the closed-form formula approach give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nTo verify, we use the closed-form formula for each layer \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\):\n\n- For Layer 9: \\( L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \\)\n- The entire expression: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach to verify. I recall that expressions like this can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if there's a pattern or formula for a_n.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution: a_n = C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, the formula works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nJust to make sure, I can compute 3*29524 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 88572.

So, 29,524 *3 is 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern that allows me to compute it more efficiently without calculating each layer. Let me see if that's possible. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, we can look for a pattern or find a closed-form expression. Let's try to compute a few terms to see if we can spot a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, we can see that each a_n is 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. Great, the formula works. So, for a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88,572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. It's reassuring that both methods give the same result, which suggests that I didn't make a mistake in either approach. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572 So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. Now, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29,524. So, 3*29,524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. That seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in another way. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series or use some formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me try that approach to verify. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. So, the general formula for each layer is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer.
