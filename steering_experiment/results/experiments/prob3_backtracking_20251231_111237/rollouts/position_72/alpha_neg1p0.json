    "text": " Then 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. Then 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Then 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. Then 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, it's 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, it seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The homogeneous part is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Wait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I got Layer 9 as 29524. So 3*29524=88572. But let me check my earlier computations because sometimes when I compute layer by layer, I might have made a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each ( is a new layer. Let's see: After 3, there are 9 sets of (1+3(...)). So, that's 9 layers. So, I computed up to Layer 9 correctly. Therefore, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but let me compute 3*29524 again to be sure. 29524 *3: 29524 *3:\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n4 *3 =12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but let me do it another way. 29524 *3 can be broken down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3 = 20000*3 +9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3 = 60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 +27000 =87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that matches. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a few layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's go through Layers 1 to 3 again: Layer1:1+3=4. Correct. Layer2:1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. So, all layers are correct, and the multiplication at the end is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, yeah, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, but wait, let me check with another method to be sure. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 90000 - 1000 = 89000, 89000 - 428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer would be 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Wait, but I just realized something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. But when I numbered the layers, I started from the innermost as Layer 1 up to Layer 9. So, when I computed Layer 9, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But to make sure, let me try computing one more layer manually. Let's say I compute up to Layer 5, which I had as 364. Let's check that. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Now, if I compute Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c can be found using the formula. Let me recall: For a linear recurrence relation a_n = r*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = (a_1 + d/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} - d/(1 - r). Wait, maybe that's not exactly right, but let me try to derive it. Alternatively, since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\). Using the recurrence relation, we determine the value at each layer up to the ninth, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing them. Let's go through each layer again to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a multiplication error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me try to model this. Let's denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is linear and has the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c=1 and r=3. The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r))*(1 - r^n) + (a_0*r)/(1 - r). Wait, no, let me recall the formula correctly. For a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^n*a_0 + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). But in our case, a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is based on r=3, and the particular solution is based on the constant term. The general solution would be a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. To find B, we set a_n = B, so B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572. So, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring. I think I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with nine layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we find the solution using the formula for such a sequence.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use here instead of computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. Let me think about whether this expression can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, this seems like a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.

So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.

The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution can be found using the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.

    "text": " 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n can be computed recursively. But since I already computed up to a_9, which is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, I think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that each layer is a geometric series or something. Let me see: a_1 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, looking at the sequence: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I can see that each term is 3 times the previous minus something? Wait, 13 = 3*4 + 1. 40 = 3*13 + 1. 121 = 3*40 +1. So, in general, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1. That's a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let me see: For n=1, a_1 = 4. If n=1, (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, which is not 4. So that formula doesn't fit. Maybe it's a different formula. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula: For n=1, a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4, a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the general formula is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. Either way, I get the same answer, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, leading up to the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but wait a minute, let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do it step by step. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), which is a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation to find a formula, but since I already computed each layer step by step, maybe it's not necessary. However, just for thoroughness, let's try to model it. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, the expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is as computed. So, yeah, 88572 seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the right way to break it down. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29000*3 = 87000, 524*3=1572. So, 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've got the right answer here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I calculated earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 - 1)/2=59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and then we multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Let me just double-check my multiplication to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524\nx   3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, we get 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as follows:\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29,524. Multiplying this by the outermost 3 gives the final answer of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let's see: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nWait, actually, starting from a_1=1+3=4, then a_2=1+3*a_1=1+12=13, and so on. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction, but maybe that's okay.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So when n=1, a_1=4=C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the nth term is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form solution saves time and reduces the chance of error. But since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible, though time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that each layer is a multiple of 3 plus 1, so perhaps there's a pattern in the exponents. But since I've already solved it using both methods, I can be confident that the answer is correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding these up: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

    "text": " 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just cross-verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about whether this can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 was 1+3=4, a_2=1+3*4=13, etc. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. Let me solve for B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's consistent. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, (59049 -1)/2 is indeed 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, so a_2=1+3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, and so on, which is what I did earlier. So, either way, I get the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Okay, so that seems consistent. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again in a different way, perhaps using a formula instead of step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. Given that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say D. Plugging into the equation: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the first few layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. Then, 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation.

But wait, let me check my earlier computations because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me consider what happens when you have such a nested expression. Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) But since the pattern repeats, the inner expression is similar to E itself, except scaled down. Wait, but in this case, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, so maybe it's a finite geometric series rather than an infinite one. Let me try to model this. Each layer can be represented as a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as before. So, a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, is there a formula for such a nested expression? Let's think about the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the expression inside is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the manual calculation. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution. Let's find C. Assuming a particular solution is a constant, C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, so n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.

Wait, but let me check my earlier layers again because that seems like a big number. Let me recompute each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have saved time and reduced errors. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous one. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term. Let me denote the layers as a sequence a_n where n is the layer number.\n\nSo, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nAnd the final result is 3*a_9.\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3.\n\nTherefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I arrive at the same result as when I computed each layer manually. That gives me more confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that approach as well.\n\nLooking at the expression, each term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, if I denote S as the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to S = 3*(1 + S'). But wait, that might not directly apply here because each layer is a separate term.\n\nWait, perhaps if I consider the entire expression as S, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which would be S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) But that seems circular because the inner expression is similar to S itself. Wait, maybe that's a way to model it. Let me try.\n\nLet me assume that the innermost expression is S, so S = 1 + 3*S, but that can't be because in the original problem, each layer is only 1 + 3*(next layer). Wait, perhaps if I consider the entire expression after the first 3 as S, then S = 1 + 3*S_inner, where S_inner is the next layer. But this might get too convoluted. Alternatively, since we have a finite number of layers, maybe it's better to use the formula we derived earlier.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead me to the same result, so I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx     3\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carry over 0.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the product is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that confirms it again.\n\nSo, after all that, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's a bit different because each term is built upon the previous one with multiplication by 3. Let me try to model this. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. As we saw earlier. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^p = A, where A is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. In our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without going through each layer. That might be faster, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since it's only nine layers, either method works. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication with a repeating pattern. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Because computing nine layers manually might be error-prone, even though I double-checked each step. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1, then each subsequent layer a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on up to a_9, which we've calculated as 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Since each a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is more efficient and reduces the chance of error. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back through each layer to check for any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, but nested. Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on, which matches what I calculated earlier. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

But let me double-check my computations step by step because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me recast each layer computation to ensure I didn't make any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this again step by step: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer step by step. Let me see if that's possible. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))) with nine layers. Let me denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3a_9. Let me see if there's a recursive formula here. Each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as computed earlier. So, this formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I found earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution also leads me to the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a sum of a geometric series, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, which complicates things. However, the recurrence approach worked well. So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step, verifying each computation, and then using a recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, I arrived at the final answer of 88572. I feel confident that this is correct because multiple methods led me to the same result, and I double-checked each step for arithmetic errors.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the computation. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=3 and d=1. So, the general solution would be a_n = 3^n * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, let's check that. Wait, actually, the standard form is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d. Our case is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, so c=3, d=1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our case, the first term is a_1 = 4, which is when n=1. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the innermost being a_1, and each subsequent layer adds one more, so the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can model it as such. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let's try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without calculating each layer, but since I already have the formula, it's efficient. But just to make sure, let me see: Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. So, 3^{10} is 59049, as I said. Then, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence relation approach confirms the result. So, I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, this gives \\( a_9 = 29524 \\).

Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be calculated as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that confirms it. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me recompute the layers step by step to ensure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Wait, but let me check if the expression is correctly parsed. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 9. So yes, the total is 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 * 2 + something? Wait, actually, the standard form for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = k^{n}*(a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, let me recall. For a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, the solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2}/2) - 1/2 = (9/2) - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3/2) - 1/2 = (27/2) - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. So the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me see: (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in our problem, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo whether I compute it step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same conclusion. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine each layer's value step by step, leading to the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, but let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, carry 1, 9 + 9 + 1 = 19, carry 1, 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. So that's 59048.

So that must be correct. Wait, but when I added 59048 + 29524, I got 58872, which is different. I must have made a mistake in that addition. Let me try adding 59048 + 29524 again.\n\n59048\n+29524\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carry 0\n\n0 + 5 = 5, write 5\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1\n\n5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write 8\n\nSo, the sum is 88572.

So that should be the final answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524, then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then add 1: 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, each layer is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first did the addition of 59048 + 29524, I got 58872, but that's incorrect. The correct way is 59048 + 29524 = 88572. So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with another method.

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation here: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, substituting the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 1 + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our layers have integer values. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, let's compute the first few terms and see if a pattern emerges. From above, we have: L_1 = 4 = 4\nL_2 = 13\nL_3 = 40\nL_4 = 121\nL_5 = 364\nL_6 = 1093\nL_7 = 3280\nL_8 = 9841\nL_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term minus something. Let me check:\n\nL_2 = 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 13\nL_3 = 40 = 3*13 + 1 = 40\nWait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Similarly, L_4 = 3*40 + 1 = 121. Wait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, actually, the recurrence seems to be L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Hmm, but earlier I thought it was L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is the same as 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, perhaps the general solution can be found for L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The standard approach for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution L_n = C*3^{n}, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, which is our outermost layer: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since we have a formula for L_n, maybe we can express the entire expression in terms of L_n. The original expression is 3*(L_9). Since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recurrence relation approach give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the value of the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092=1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 +270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279=3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. So Layer 8: 1 + 9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523=29524 Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series or find a pattern because each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer. Maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. If I have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=1+3=4. Then each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let me recall that for a recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). Wait, let me check. Actually, for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * (a_0) + c*(k^{n} - 1)/(k - 1). But in our case, a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is a_n=1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, k=3, c=1. Then the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, our initial condition is a_1=4, so n=1 gives a_1=4. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. Alternatively, maybe it's better to index the layers starting from 0. Let me try that. Let me define a_0 as the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*4=13, which matches Layer 2. a_2=1 + 3*a_1=1 + 3*13=40, which is Layer 3. So in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=4. So, to find a_8, because there are 9 layers, starting from a_0 up to a_8. So, how do we solve this recurrence? The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_0=4: 4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = C - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So the solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2. Now, since we need a_8, let's compute that: a_8 = (9*3^8 - 1)/2. Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. So, a_8 = (9*6561 - 1)/2. Compute 9*6561: 6561*9. Let's compute that: 6000*9=54000, 500*9=4500, 60*9=540, 1*9=9. So 54000 + 4500 = 58500 + 540 = 59040 + 9 = 59049. So, 9*6561=59049. Then, 59049 -1=59048. So, a_8=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier result. So, the outermost layer is 29524, and then we have 3*(29524)=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I had used the formula from the start, I could have saved some time, but since I was computing step by step, it worked out. I think I did it correctly, but just to be thorough, let me compute one more layer manually to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Let's say Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer4=1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, all layers are correct, and the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost expression is reached. The final step involves multiplying the result by 3. The computation confirms that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for each layer because I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let's go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n, where L_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive sequence. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me substitute into the recurrence relation: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. Using the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, starting from the innermost layer, each time we're doing 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric progression. Let me consider the entire expression E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). If I let E be the entire expression, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). But actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around. Wait, maybe another approach: Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But the inner part is similar to E/3, because E = 3*(1 + 3*(inner part)). Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me try to write it as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me denote the inner expression as F, so F = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*F). But F itself is similar to E, but without the outermost 3. Hmm, maybe not the best approach. Alternatively, since we have 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, perhaps we can model it as a sum of a geometric series. Let me think: Each layer can be seen as 3^k, where k is the number of layers. But given that each layer is built upon the previous, it's more of a recursive structure. But since we've already found the general formula, maybe that's sufficient. So, to recap, each layer n is given by L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to compute this is by recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric series. Let me try to expand the expression step by step without using the formula, just to confirm. Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13. Next layer:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Next:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Then:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Next:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Then:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Next:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Then:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Finally, multiply by 3:3*29524=88572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, all methods lead to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recursive pattern.

Hmm, but let me cross-verify this because sometimes when I compute step by step, I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me recompute each layer to make sure I didn't make an error.

Yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to compute it more efficiently without calculating each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. So, the general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. First, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods\u2014direct computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014I arrive at the same result. This makes me confident that the answer is indeed 88572.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again\u2014am I sure that each layer is correctly computed? Let me compute Layer 5 again just to be thorough. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3. So 360 + 3 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192. 900 + 192 = 1092. 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 123 = 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Therefore, multiplying the outermost 3 by 29524 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try another approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me consider that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for a_n. Let me write down the first few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, looking at these numbers, I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I have:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, as a_1=4.\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, as a_2=13.\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct, as a_3=40.\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct, as a_4=121.\nFor n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct, as a_5=364.\nSo the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or computations. So, yeah, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

Let me just go through the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if there are more layers. Let me think about that. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it as a recurrence. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, we can compute a_2, a_3, ..., a_9 as we did before. Alternatively, we can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using the closed-form expression, we can compute it directly without having to go through each layer step by step. That might be more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, both methods work. I think I've got the correct answer here. To recap, the process was: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward. 2. Computed each layer step by step, verifying each result. 3. Noticing a pattern, I considered whether a recurrence relation or closed-form formula could be used, which it could, leading to the same result. 4. Verified the closed-form formula with known values to ensure its correctness. 5. Applied the formula to find the value of the innermost expression, then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. Then a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1} for n>1. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer step by step, which might have saved time, but since I was doing it manually, step by step was fine. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, then each 1+3( adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each step out adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 occurs. Each time we have 1+3(, so in the expression, I can count the number of times that occurs. Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each 1+3( is a new layer. Let's count the number of 1+3( inside the main expression. From the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, and each time we go out, we add another 1+3(, so the number of layers is 9, right? Because from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1+3(, so total layers are 9. So when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct. Let me check my calculations again to be sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recurrence relations. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built by the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, which matches what I computed earlier. So, this is indeed a linear recurrence relation. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.

Hmm, but let me check if I computed each layer correctly, because that seems like a big number. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic error. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. We have: L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the step-by-step approach seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about how these types of expressions work. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = -1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (-1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, what is the initial condition? Let's see, L1 = 4. So, when n=1, L1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: L5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n=6: L6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n=7: L7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n=8: L8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result as by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can think about this expression in terms of a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, it's similar to a geometric progression with a ratio of 3, but with an additional 1 added each time. Let me try to expand the expression to see if it forms a geometric series. The original expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me write this out step by step, expanding each layer:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the expression as a sum, perhaps I can represent it as:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*(next term). So, if I denote S as the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). But this seems recursive, so maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nWait, but if I expand all the way, the entire expression would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me try expanding this step by step:\n\nFirst, the innermost part is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3, considering the nested structure.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which can be seen as adding a term that's 3^k for each layer.\n\nLet me see: If I expand the expression, it's similar to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to some power, but let me verify.\n\nWait, when I expand the expression, each 1 is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try to see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but if I expand this, each 1 is contributing to a term that's multiplied by 3 each time. So, perhaps the entire expression can be written as a sum of 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9, but adjusted because each 1 is being added at each layer.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Each time we have 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. So, perhaps the total sum is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1, and having 10 terms (since there are 9 layers plus the initial 1). Let me check: The sum S of a geometric series with first term a=1, ratio r=3, and n=10 terms is S = (3^{10} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Wait, that's exactly Layer 9. So, the innermost expression up to Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the expression can be evaluated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, which gives us the same result.\n\nIn conclusion, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a formula, and considering it as a geometric series, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\). By expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the innermost expression up to the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n2. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me just check if I did all the layers correctly because that's a lot of steps. Let me list each layer's computation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4  \nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13  \nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40  \nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121  \nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364  \nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093  \nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280  \nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841  \nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524  \nFinal step: 3*29524 = 88572  \n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations. Each step seems to follow logically, so I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.
