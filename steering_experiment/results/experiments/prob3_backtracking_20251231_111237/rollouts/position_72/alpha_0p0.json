Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Let me think about whether there's a formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe it's overcomplicating for just nine terms. However, for future reference, let's see: The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So this formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the earlier steps, which would throw off the entire result. Let me go back through each layer and confirm that each step was correct. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. It looks like a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, the closed-form approach confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with a repeating pattern.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to find a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n + C = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + C). Let me see if I can find a particular solution. Assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = K. Then substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the computed values. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, as before. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be thorough, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524 * 3: Let me do it digit by digit again. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, reading the digits from bottom to top: 8 8 5 7 2. So 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I'm all set.

But wait, I just realized that the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers again to make sure. Starting from the innermost: each time I have 1+3(...), so let me count how many times that occurs. The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2 wraps around that, Layer 3 wraps around Layer 2, and so on until Layer 9. So, yes, nine layers in total, each computed correctly. So, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives me 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and less error-prone. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b/(a-1)). Let me check that. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since b is a constant, let's assume L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(29524)=88572. Yeah, that seems consistent. I don't think I made any mistakes here. I double-checked each layer and even derived a formula for the nth layer, which confirmed my calculations. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here where each layer is following a geometric progression or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent each layer as a function. Let me think: Let's denote each layer as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Then, we can compute up to a_9, and then multiply by 3. Alternatively, maybe there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula\u2014give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows a pattern where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a recursive formula or a closed-form expression, we determine that the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my layers to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1 + 3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=1+120=121.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here, rather than computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me compute a few terms to see if I can spot a pattern: a_1 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Hmm, do these numbers correspond to any known sequence? Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Substituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P. Solving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation approach, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.

Alternatively, I can think about this expression as a geometric series. Wait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see: Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nAnd so on. I notice that each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L(n). Let's try to find a pattern or formula for L(n). Let me write down the terms:\n\nn: 1, L(n): 4\n\nn: 2, L(n): 13\n\nn: 3, L(n): 40\n\nn: 4, L(n): 121\n\nn: 5, L(n): 364\n\nn: 6, L(n): 1093\n\nn: 7, L(n): 3280\n\nn: 8, L(n): 9841\n\nn: 9, L(n): 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers, they seem familiar. Wait a minute, these numbers are similar to the terms in the expansion of (3^n) - something. Let me check:\n\nFor n=1: 3^1 = 3. L1=4. 3 + 1=4.\n\nn=2: 3^2=9. L2=13. 9 + 4=13.\n\nn=3: 3^3=27. L3=40. 27 + 13=40.\n\nn=4: 3^4=81. L4=121. 81 + 40=121.\n\nn=5: 3^5=243. L5=364. 243 + 121=364.\n\nn=6: 3^6=729. L6=1093. 729 + 364=1093.\n\nn=7: 3^7=2187.

So, let me see:\n\nIf L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), and starting from L1=4.\n\nWait, if I unroll the recursion:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) )\n\nWhich is the same as the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3 and some terms.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's consider the recurrence relation:\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nL(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1:\n\nL(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nL(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nL(3)=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\n(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5:\n\n(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6:\n\n(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7:\n\n(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8:\n\n(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9:\n\n(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, using the closed-form formula, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, L(9)= (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Correct, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the multiplication earlier.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*29524 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Let me check:\n\n30000*3=90000\n\n476*3=1428\n\nSo, 90000 - 1428=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives us 29524. Multiplying by the outermost 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see: The value at each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for L_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), but since a \u2260 1. Wait, actually, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p = a*L_p + b. Solving for L_p: L_p - a*L_p = b => L_p*(1 - a) = b => L_p = b/(1 - a). So, the general solution is L_n = C*a^n + L_p. Now, applying initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + L_p = 3C + L_p. But L_p = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2. So, 4 = 3C - 1/2. Therefore, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers I computed. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the recurrence relation approach confirms each layer's value. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: L_n = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Therefore, equating the coefficients: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4. Plugging n=1 into the general solution: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3 * L_9, where L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step builds on the previous one correctly, and the formula approach confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))), with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested rather than summed. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. Let me see if I can express this recursively. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's much more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. But since we only had nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad either. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence gives a closed-form formula, which allows us to compute the value of the outermost layer directly. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, our problem has 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that directly: 3*( (59049 -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same final answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer.

Using a recursive approach or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I feel like I might have made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error in computation. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could get tedious with more layers. Let me think about whether this sequence follows a known pattern. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n^{(h)} = 3*a_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. Perfect, so the formula works. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and the repeating pattern. 2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost parentheses. 3. Identify the recurrence relation and solve it to find a general formula. 4. Use the formula to compute the value without manually calculating each layer. 5. Multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression. 6. Verify the result using both step-by-step computation and the formula to ensure accuracy. This problem was a good exercise in recognizing patterns, using recurrence relations, and verifying results through multiple methods. It also emphasized the importance of careful arithmetic to avoid mistakes, especially when dealing with large numbers.

Let me just double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake along the way. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since the number of layers isn't too large, step-by-step computation is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, and then each subsequent a_n is built upon the previous one. So, in general, for such a recurrence, the solution can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. The general solution for a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + initial term, but maybe I'm misremembering. Let me think. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, to solve this, we can write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 up to layer 9, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but since each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term, it might follow a specific recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct, but just to be thorough, let me try computing a few more layers using the formula to make sure. For example, a_5 should be (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which matches my earlier calculation. Similarly, a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct. So, the formula is solid. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 starts a new layer. Let's count the number of 3s inside the parentheses:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is outside, and then each subsequent 3 is inside. Let's see how many 3s are there:\n\nStarting from the first 3 after the first parenthesis, each time we have a 3 followed by a (...\n\nCounting the number of 3s inside the parentheses:\n\n1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1)\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2)\n...\nUp to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8)\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, each corresponding to a 3 inside the parentheses. Therefore, the outermost layer is Layer9, and then multiplied by the initial 3, making the total expression 3*(Layer9). Therefore, my earlier calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each time we have 1 + 3*(previous term), which is a linear recurrence as I found earlier. So, using the formula, we can compute the nth term directly without having to compute each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if n is large.\n\nIn this case, since n=9, it's manageable, but for larger n, the formula would be more practical. Anyway, since I've confirmed it both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n3. Compute each layer step by step up to the 9th layer, which gives 29524.\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that all adds up. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think I'm good.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone, especially with nine layers. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have an expression like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3. Then each subsequent a_n is defined recursively. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Wait, that's exactly what I computed earlier. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, maybe using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. The homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 =4, and each subsequent layer is a_n up to a_9. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be written as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 =3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. Same result. So, that's consistent.

Let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. I can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also leads me to the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's like building a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. But since each layer depends on the previous, it's a bit different. However, using the formula I derived earlier, which is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, it's straightforward to compute the value for n=9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, either by computing each layer step by step or by finding a general formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the value of the ninth layer, which equals 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, it's a recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n, whose solution is a_n = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let's see: Starting from a_1 = 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which checks out. So, a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is what I got earlier. So, this method confirms the result. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression step by step. Let me denote the innermost term as T: T = 1 + 3. Then, moving outwards: Next layer: 1 + 3*T = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. Then, next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*T) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, but this seems similar to the layer approach. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try expanding the entire expression step by step. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Wait, but that's the same as the original expression. Alternatively, maybe I can express E in terms of itself, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here since it's a finite number of layers. Alternatively, I can compute each layer step by step as I did before, which seems straightforward. Since I already have the result as 88,572, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation method lead to the same result, I can be confident that the answer is correct.

Correct. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524, which is 88,572. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me think about it as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again step by step. 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I can confidently say that the result of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recursive formula. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute L_9 directly without computing each layer step by step, which would have saved time. But since I was working it out step by step, the method of computing each layer was straightforward and reliable. It's always good to verify using a different approach to ensure that the answer is correct.

Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to do each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me recount. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let's check: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that. The expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, we have 9 layers. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a couple more layers using the formula to see if it holds. For example, Layer 5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Which is what I got earlier. Layer 7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct. So, the formula works, and using it, I can compute each layer without manually stepping through each multiplication. This would be especially helpful if the number of layers were larger, as it would save a lot of time. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, both methods work fine. So, to recap: The problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Using the recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n is the layer number. For the ninth layer, this gives us 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final result of 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula confirms the step-by-step computation. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). \n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final answer is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but let me check another way. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series or something like that, since each layer seems to be a repetition of multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric sequence. Let me consider that. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a recursive relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So that's the same as before. Now, to find a closed-form formula for a_n, we can solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our previous calculation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To double-check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the approach works. For example, let's compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this using both methods. Step-by-step: Innermost: 1 + 3 =4. Next layer: 1 +3*4=13. Next layer: 1 +3*13=40. Outermost: 3*40=120. Using the formula: Here, n=3 layers inside. So a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Then 3*a_3=120. Correct. Alternatively, compute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 +12))=3(1 +3*13)=3(1 +39)=3*40=120. Correct. So the formula works for a smaller case, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, but let me double-check each step because these nested expressions can get tricky. Let me recount each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2. And so on, up to L_9. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and it can be solved using standard techniques. Let's try to find a pattern. Compute the first few terms: L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as we can see, each term is 1 more than 3 times the previous term. To solve the recurrence relation L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4, we can use the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Wait, that seems odd because our particular solution is a fraction, but our initial conditions are integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern by expanding the terms. Let me write down the terms:\n\nL_1 = 4 = 3^1 + 1\nWait, 3^1 = 3, 3 + 1 = 4. Hmm, but L_2 = 13. Let me see: 3^2 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10, which is not 13. Alternatively, maybe it's 3^{n} + something.\n\nWait, let's compute the terms:\n\nL_1 = 4 = 3 + 1\nL_2 = 13 = 9 + 4\nL_3 = 40 = 27 + 13\nL_4 = 121 = 81 + 40\nHmm, I see that each term is 3^{n} plus the previous term. Wait, 3^2 is 9, plus 4 (which is L_1) gives 13, which is L_2. Then 3^3 is 27, plus L_2 (13) gives 40, which is L_3. 3^4 is 81, plus L_3 (40) gives 121, which is L_4. So, in general, L_n = 3^{n} + L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. But wait, our original recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Let me check if L_n = 3^{n} + L_{n-1} is consistent with that. Let's see:\n\nFrom the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\nFrom the pattern: L_n = 3^{n} + L_{n-1}\n\nSo, setting them equal: 3^{n} + L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\nThus, 3^{n} = 1 + 2*L_{n-1}\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to hold for n=2:\n\nFor n=2: 3^2 = 9, 1 + 2*L_1 = 1 + 2*4 = 9. Yes, that works.\n\nn=3: 3^3=27, 1 + 2*L_2=1 + 2*13=27. Correct.\n\nn=4: 81 vs 1 + 2*40=81. Correct.\n\nSo, indeed, 3^{n} = 1 + 2*L_{n-1}\n\nThus, we can write L_{n} = (3^{n} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let's test this formula.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1. But L_1 is 4, so that doesn't work. Hmm, maybe my indexing is off. Let me check for n=2:\n\nL_2 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=4. But L_2 is 13, so that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the pattern.\n\nWait, let's go back. From the recurrence L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, LHS: A*3^{n} + B = RHS: 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B\n\nThus, B - 3B = 1 => -2B=1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9 for the outermost layer. Thus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that each layer is part of a geometric series, but the step-by-step computation seems to have worked well, and the formula confirms the result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2.\n\nThus, 88572.

Let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct. Layer 3:1 + 3*13=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 + 3*40=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 + 3*121=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 + 3*364=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each layer. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous and particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of the formula. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Which is (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or compute it directly using exponents, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with 88572 as the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9 (Outermost Layer):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because if I made a mistake in one of the layers, the final answer would be off. Let me go through each layer again to make sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, all layers seem correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. It seems like each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^n * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, actually, the formula for a linear recurrence like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, let me recall the correct formula. For a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation of the first order, the solution can be found as follows: If L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, then the solution is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Let me check that. Let's test it with our values. Here, L_1 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. Let me see what L_0 would be. If n=1, then L_1 = a*L_0 + b. So, 4 = 3*L_0 + 1. Therefore, 3*L_0 = 3, so L_0 = 1. So, L_0 =1. Now, using the formula: L_n = 3^{n} * L_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). Simplify: L_n = 3^{n} *1 + (3^{n} -1)/2. So, L_n = 3^{n} + (3^{n} -1)/2 = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} -1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this with our earlier values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me check: the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, Layer 9 would correspond to n=9. Therefore, Layer 9 = L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the linear recurrence relation, we find that each layer L_n can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But wait, let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost: 1+3, which is Layer 1: 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 =13. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without doing each layer step by step, but given that it's only nine layers, step-by-step is manageable. Alternatively, I can recognize that this is a geometric series or something similar, but given the nesting, it's probably a recurrence relation. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{hom} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{part} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct.

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to express it in terms of a recurrence relation. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. It's more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large, as it avoids computing each layer step by step. But for nine layers, both methods work. Let me just confirm once more that the formula is correct by computing a_4 using the formula: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 =121. Which matches our earlier result. So, I'm confident that the formula is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, let's see if there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution comes from the equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed layers to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers, so it seems reliable. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier calculation. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Perfect, that's the same result. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\) and each subsequent layer is defined by \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).

But wait, let me double-check my earlier computations for each layer because that's a lot of steps and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it more efficiently, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me check another way. Suppose I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}. The particular solution is a constant, a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the explicit formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with my earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. Same result. So, either way, whether computing step by step, using the recurrence, or applying the explicit formula, I arrive at the same answer. So, I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed with a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward, ultimately multiplying by 3 to get the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is $\\boxed{88572}$."

So 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if this forms a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nHmm, I see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1}=0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow apply the initial condition to find C.\n\nAt n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid.

Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's similar to expanding (1 + 3)^n, but that's not exactly the case because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, not raised to a power. Wait, actually, if I consider each layer, the value seems to be following a pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me compute the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from a1 = 4, up to a9 = 29524. Then the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4. The general solution to such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where D is a constant particular solution. To find D, set a_n = D, then D = 3*D + 1, so D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9: a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's a more efficient method, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since we have 9 layers, both methods work fine. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer, and the entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer. By computing each layer step by step or by using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we find that the value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 =1 +3*L2, and so on up to L9. Then, the total expression is 3*L9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for Ln. Let me try to find a pattern. Let's compute the first few layers: L1 = 4, L2 =13, L3=40, L4=121, L5=364, L6=1093, L7=3280, L8=9841, L9=29524. Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524. I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, let me check: L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4=13. L3=1 +3*L2=1+3*13=40. L4=1 +3*L3=1 +3*40=121. So yes, each L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form for such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1 in this case. The solution to such a recurrence is known. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say L. So, substituting L into the equation: L = a*L + b => L = (a*L) + b => L*(1 - a) = b => L = b/(1 - a). But in our case, a=3, so L = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the layers we've computed. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, L9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10} directly, which is 59049, and then compute (59049 -1)/2=29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Either way, the result is the same. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the pattern checks out with both step-by-step computation and the general formula.

So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I made a mistake in the general solution.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me solve it properly. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K =1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step computation.

Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming, especially if there are more layers. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me think about it. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right-hand side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1, so B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} or something, but since we already have the numerical value, I think 88572 is the answer. Just to recap, the key steps were recognizing the recurrence relation, solving it to find a closed-form expression, verifying it with the initial terms, and then computing the 9th layer. Then, multiplying by 3 to get the final result. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"
