    "text": " 3 * 4 = 12 Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression should be 88572. Let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did this right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. If I have an expression like 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), it's a geometric series perhaps? Wait, but in this case, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, so it's a recurrence relation. Let me see: Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, if I didn't think of the recurrence relation, I might have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also gave me the same result. Either way, both methods confirm that the value is 88572. So, I think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By expanding from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step until reaching the outermost layer. Then, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final value.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2.

Multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits: 8 8 5 2 4?

So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the multiplication another way. 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 + 29524 = 59048\n\n59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...), which resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Maybe I can model it with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from the innermost as a_1 up to a_9. So, the innermost Layer 1 is a_1 = 4, Layer 2 is a_2 = 13, and so on, up to Layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches. a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. So, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach, I also arrive at the same result, which confirms that the earlier step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize that each layer is a term in a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). This is similar to the expansion of (3^n - 1)/2, which we saw earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time you add a layer, you're effectively scaling the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, after n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, with 9 layers, the value is (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways now, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation method led me to the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. \n\nTo solve this, we recognize that the expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$. By working from the innermost layer outward, we compute each layer step by step. \n\nWe define each layer as a sequence where each term is calculated as $a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1}$, starting with the innermost layer. Using the recurrence relation, we find that each term can be expressed as $a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$. \n\nFor the given expression with 9 layers, the outermost layer corresponds to $a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524$. Finally, we multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether this expression forms a geometric series or something similar. Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's reassuring. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let's see: 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without having to go through each layer. That's pretty cool. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern and using recurrence relations can simplify the problem. I guess the key takeaway here is that when faced with a nested expression like this, looking for a pattern or a recurrence can save a lot of time and reduce the chance of errors. But even if I didn't see the pattern initially, computing each layer step by step worked too, although it was a bit tedious. I'm glad I checked my work using the formula because it confirmed that my step-by-step computation was correct. It's always good to verify your answer using a different method if possible. So, in summary, by either computing each layer one by one or by recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I arrived at the same answer: 88,572. I think that's the correct solution. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods led me to the same place.

Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let me do that: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27. Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. But let me double-check the layers because maybe I made a mistake earlier in computing one of the layers. Let me go back step by step through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, each layer seems correct up to Layer 9. Then, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems to be the correct result. Wait, but let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of layers. The innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then, moving outward, each additional (1+3(...) adds another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) expressions. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1+3, and each time we move out, we add another 1+3*(...). Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested. Let's see:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3*(1+3)\n3. 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n...\nEach time we add another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3*(...). So, that would mean 9 layers? Wait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me write out the expression structure:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each (1 + 3*(...)) adds a new layer:\n\n- Layer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1))\n- Layer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2))\n- ...\n- Up to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8))\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Therefore, computing up to Layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a recursive sequence. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2.\n\nSo, we can compute L_1 to L_9 using this recurrence relation.\n\nLet me compute them again:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. The general form is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. That's the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways: step by step computation, using the recursive formula, and even deriving a closed-form expression using the linear recurrence solution method. All approaches lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This pattern continues up to the ninth layer, which results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer of 88572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

But wait, let me double-check my layers because the number seems quite large, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step, maybe using a different approach or simplifying the expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or formula here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches my earlier calculation. So, a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it once more:\n\n3 * 29524:\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nPutting it all together: 88572.\n\nYep, that's consistent. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3(...)) => Layer 1\n\nThen, moving out, each (1+3(...) is a layer, so total layers from the innermost to the outermost is 9. So, yes, a_9 is the outermost one, and then multiplied by 3. So, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed. So, yes, 88572 is the result.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the closed-form solution confirms the step-by-step computation. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiplying 29524 by 3: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 88,572 is correct. Wait, but that seems quite large for such a problem. Let me think again: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is tripling the previous layer and adding 1. That's a geometric progression, actually. Maybe there's a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me recall that for a geometric series, the sum can be calculated with a formula. But in this case, it's a bit different because each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Wait, actually, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Hmm, maybe I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation. The standard approach for such linear recurrences is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since there are 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result without having to compute each layer step by step. That's more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. It's good to recognize these patterns and apply the appropriate formulas to solve them. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this pattern, we can model it using a recurrence relation and find a closed-form solution. \n\nEach layer \\( a_n \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \\]\nwith the initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\nThe closed-form solution for this recurrence relation is:\n\\[ a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\]\n\nFor the innermost layer (n=1) to the outermost layer (n=9), the outermost layer \\( a_9 \\) is:\n\\[ a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So Layer 2: 1 + 12 = 13, Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40, Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121, Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or something, but given the way it's nested, working from the inside out seems the most straightforward method. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous term), so each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. So, in mathematical terms, if we denote a_n as the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is computed as such. So, the sequence goes: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, a4=121, a5=364, a6=1093, a7=3280, a8=9841, a9=29524. Then, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572. Yeah, that seems consistent. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the multiplication at the end checks out.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524. Let's compute this carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. That seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute 29524 * 3 in another way. Let's break it down digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4. So, starting from the right: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carry 0. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that's the same as before. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me just check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each time you go out, it's another 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on. So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...). Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each preceding one adds a layer. So, from the innermost, how many layers? Let's see: The innermost is (1+3). Then moving out, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the first layer is (1+3). The second layer is (1+3*(1+3)). The third layer is (1+3*(1+3*(1+3))), etc. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), and moving outward, each layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3(...): Let's break it down:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving out, the next is (1+3(1+3))\n3. Then, (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. Then, (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. Continuing this way, each time adding another layer.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many times does 1+3 appear as a separate term? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer. So, starting after the first 3, each \"(\" is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. The first \"(\" after 3 is the start of the innermost layer.\n2. Then each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"(\" in the expression. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first \"(\", which is after 3, then each subsequent \"(\" adds a new layer. Let's count:\n\n- After 3: \"(\", that's 1\n- Then inside that, another \"(\", that's 2\n- Then another \"(\", that's 3\n- And so on, until the last \"(\", which is before the final 1+3.\n\nWait, but actually, the expression is: 3 followed by a \"(\", then 1+3, then another \"(\", etc. So, each time you have a \"(\", it's a new layer. Let me count the number of \"(\" in the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet's see:\n\n1. The first \"(\" after 3: 1\n2. Then another \"(\": 2\n3. Then another \"(\": 3\n4. Then another \"(\": 4\n5. Then another \"(\": 5\n6. Then another \"(\": 6\n7. Then another \"(\": 7\n8. Then another \"(\": 8\n9. Then another \"(\": 9\n10. Then another \"(\": 10\n\nWait, but looking at the expression, I think I might have miscounted. Let me write it out:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n- After 3: 1\n- Then inside that, 1+3( : 2\n- Then inside that, 1+3( : 3\n- Then inside that, 1+3( : 4\n- Then inside that, 1+3( : 5\n- Then inside that, 1+3( : 6\n- Then inside that, 1+3( : 7\n- Then inside that, 1+3( : 8\n- Then inside that, 1+3( : 9\n- Then inside that, 1+3 : 10? Wait, no, because the last part is (1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, actually, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)). Wait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because I see nine sets of (1+3(...)). Let me check:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many times does 1+3 appear as a separate term? Let me count:\n\n1. The innermost: 1+3\n2. Then, moving out: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. Then: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nWait, but the original expression ends with )))))))) after the ninth layer. So, I think there are nine layers of 1+3(...). Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my method is correct. Let's say we have 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). How would that compute? Let's compute it step by step. Innermost layer: (1+3) = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, the entire expression is 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) = 3(1+3(1+3*4)) = 3(1+3(1+12)) = 3(1+3*13) = 3(1+39) = 3*40 = 120. That's correct. Now, let's compute another smaller version: 3(1+3(1+3)). Innermost: 1+3=4. Next layer: 1+3*4=13. Then, 3*13=39. Let me compute directly: 3(1+3(1+3))=3(1+3*4)=3(1+12)=3*13=39. Correct. So, my method works for smaller cases. Therefore, I can trust that computing each layer step by step and then multiplying by 3 at the end gives the correct result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me recalculate each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which seems like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can write a recurrence relation:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n... and so on, which matches what I did earlier.\n\nNow, to find a closed-form solution for a_n, we can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - r*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation would be k - r = 0, so k = r. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*r^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (c), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = c + r*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - r*B = c\n\nB*(1 - r) = c\n\nB = c / (1 - r)\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*r^n + c / (1 - r)\n\nNow, applying this to our specific recurrence:\n\nHere, c = 1, r = 3.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + 1/(1 - 3) = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works. So, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost layer is n=9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute a_9:\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but maybe I can use the closed-form solution to compute it directly without going through each layer. Since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nTherefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression, which gives the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, especially with such large exponents. Let me verify 3^11.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, 3^{11} is indeed 177147.\n\nThen, 177147 - 3 = 177144\n\n177144 divided by 2 is 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expressed as a geometric progression. But since I already have the closed-form solution, I think that's sufficient.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each time you have 1 + 3*(something), which is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3. So, each layer adds another term in the series. But since the series is finite (nine layers), the closed-form solution I derived earlier is appropriate.\n\nI think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572. I went through each layer step by step, double-checked with the closed-form solution, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the closed-form solution for the recurrence, we determine that the outermost layer is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 + 3 times the next nested term, repeated nine times.\n\n2. **Recurrence relation**: Each layer a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **Closed-form solution**: Solving the recurrence gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the outermost layer**: For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Let me check my multiplication again because 29524 * 3 should be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the layers. Let me verify each step again because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make an error. Let's go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute this carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me cross-verify this because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1+3(...)\" sections. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first, then each subsequent 1+3 wraps around the previous. Let me count the number of times I see \"1+3(\" in the expression. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each \"(\" after the first 3 is an opening for a new layer. Let me count the number of layers: The first layer is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each step out adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first ( after 3, each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's see: There are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, each corresponding to a layer. So, layers 1 through 9. So, I think I accounted for all 9 layers correctly. So, the computation seems correct, leading to 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formulaic way to compute this without expanding each layer, especially since this could get tedious for more layers. Let me think if there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Each layer seems to follow the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^{n} * (a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1), assuming c \u2260 1. In our case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (1)*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). But wait, our initial condition is a_1 = 4, not a_0. Let me adjust the indices. Let's define a_0 = 4, which would correspond to n=1 in the original problem. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches our earlier calculation. So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 4. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}, where A is a constant. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_0 = 4: 4 = A*3^{0} - 1/2 => 4 = A*1 - 1/2 => A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. Let's test this with n=0: a_0 = (9/2)*1 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n=1: a_1 = (9/2)*3 - 1/2 = (27/2) - (1/2) = 26/2 = 13, which matches. For n=2: a_2 = (9/2)*9 - 1/2 = (81/2) - (1/2) = 80/2 = 40, which is correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer n, the value is a_n = (9/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. So, a_9 = (9/2)*3^{9} - 1/2. Let's compute that. First, 3^9 is 19683. Then, (9/2)*19683 = (9 * 19683)/2. Let's compute 9 * 19683: 19683 * 9: 10000*9=90000, 9000*9=81000, 600*9=5400, 80*9=720, 3*9=27. Wait, that's not the right way. Actually, 19683 is 19,683. Let me compute 19,683 * 9: 19,683 * 9: 10,000 *9=90,000; 9,000*9=81,000; 600*9=5,400; 80*9=720; 3*9=27. Now, adding these together: 90,000 + 81,000 = 171,000; 171,000 + 5,400 = 176,400; 176,400 + 720 = 177,120; 177,120 + 27 = 177,147. So, (9/2)*19683 = 177,147 / 2 = 88,573.5. Now, subtracting 1/2: 88,573.5 - 0.5 = 88,573.0. Wait, but earlier, when I computed each layer step by step, I ended up with 29,524 at layer 9, which when multiplied by 3 gave me 88,572. But according to this formula, a_9 = 88,573. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. That suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check my calculations again. First, the closed-form solution: a_n = (9/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. For n=9, that's (9/2)*19683 - 1/2. Let's compute 19683 * 9 first. 19683 * 9: Let's compute 20,000 *9 = 180,000, but since it's 19683, which is 20,000 - 317, so 19683 *9 = 180,000 - (317*9). 317*9: 300*9=2700, 17*9=153, so 2700+153=2853. Therefore, 19683*9 = 180,000 - 2,853 = 177,147. So, (9/2)*19683 = 177,147 / 2 = 88,573.5. Then, subtracting 0.5 gives 88,573.0. But when I computed layer 9 step by step, I got 29,524, and 29,524 *3 =88,572. So, there's a difference of 1 between the two results. That suggests that I made a mistake in either the closed-form solution or in the step-by-step computation. Let me check the step-by-step computation again, focusing on layer 9. Let's recompute each layer carefully: Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4 Correct. Layer 2:1 + 3*4=1 +12=13 Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 Correct. Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180,4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 +1092=1093 Correct. Layer7:1 +3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000,90*3=270,3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 +3279=3280 Correct. Layer8:1 +3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then 1 +9840=9841 Correct. Layer9:1 +3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120,1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. So, Layer9=29524. Then, total expression is 3*29524=88572. So, according to step-by-step, it's 88572. According to the formula, it's 88,573. So, there's a discrepancy of 1. That suggests that either the formula is incorrect or I made a mistake in applying it. Let me check the formula again. The recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_0=4. The general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2. Applying a_0=4: 4 = A*3^0 -1/2 =>4 = A -1/2 => A=4 +1/2=9/2. So, a_n=(9/2)*3^{n} -1/2. For n=9: a_9=(9/2)*3^9 -1/2=(9/2)*19683 -1/2= (9*19683)/2 -0.5= 177,147/2 -0.5=88,573.5 -0.5=88,573. But in the step-by-step, I got 29,524 for a_9, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. So, the formula suggests a_9=88,573, but step-by-step suggests a_9=29,524. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me see: The formula gives a_n as the value at each layer, but in the problem, the total expression is 3*a_9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), which is 3*a_9. So, according to the formula, a_9=88,573, so the total expression is 3*a_9=3*88,573=265,719. But that's not matching with the step-by-step. Wait, that can't be. There's confusion here. Let me clarify: The formula gives a_n as the value of the nth layer, which is 1 +3*a_{n-1}. So, a_9=29,524 as per step-by-step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. But according to the formula, a_n is 88,573 when n=9, which would mean that 3*a_9=265,719, which is way off. Therefore, I must have misapplied the formula. Let me reconsider. Maybe I confused the indices. Let's re-examine the recurrence. If a_0=4, then a_1=1 +3*a_0=13, which is correct. a_2=1 +3*a_1=40, correct. a_3=1 +3*a_2=121, correct. So, for n=1, a_1=13; for n=2, a_2=40; n=3, a_3=121; and so on, up to n=9, a_9=29,524. Therefore, the formula a_n=(9/2)*3^{n} -1/2 gives a_n as the value at each layer. So, for n=1, a_1=(9/2)*3^1 -1/2= (27/2) -1/2=26/2=13, which is correct. For n=2, a_2=(9/2)*9 -1/2= (81/2) -1/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=3, a_3=(9/2)*27 -1/2= (243/2) -1/2=242/2=121, correct. So, the formula works for lower n. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(9/2)*3^9 -1/2= (9*19683)/2 -1/2= 177,147/2 -1/2=88,573.5 -0.5=88,573. But according to step-by-step, a_9=29,524. So, there's a contradiction. Therefore, I must have misapplied the formula. Wait a minute, perhaps the formula is giving me the value of the entire expression, not just the inner layers. Let me think again. The problem is 3*(layer9). So, if a_9=29,524, then the total is 3*29,524=88,572. But according to the formula, a_n is the value of the nth layer, which for n=9 is 29,524. Therefore, the formula a_n=(9/2)*3^{n} -1/2 is giving me a_n as 88,573 when n=9, which is incorrect because step-by-step shows a_9=29,524. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in setting up the recurrence relation. Let me re-examine the problem. The expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, each layer is 1 +3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, layer1=1+3=4. Layer2=1+3*4=13. Layer3=1+3*13=40. Layer4=1+3*40=121. Layer5=1+3*121=364. Layer6=1+3*364=1093. Layer7=1+3*1093=3280. Layer8=1+3*3280=9841. Layer9=1+3*9841=29524. Therefore, a_9=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=88572. So, the formula must be giving me a_n as 29524 when n=9, but according to the formula, a_n=(9/2)*3^{n} -1/2, which for n=9 gives 88,573, which is not matching. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-derive the formula. The recurrence is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Wait, no. Actually, a_0=4, a_1=13, etc. So, in the formula, a_n=(9/2)*3^{n} -1/2. For n=9, that's (9/2)*3^9 -1/2= (9*19683)/2 -1/2=177,147/2 -1/2=88,573.5 -0.5=88,573. But that's not equal to a_9=29,524. Therefore, the formula is not applicable here, or I misapplied it. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is for the total expression, not just the inner layers. Wait, no. The total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9=29,524. So, the total is 88,572. Therefore, perhaps the formula is not needed here, and the step-by-step computation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula because the initial condition was set incorrectly. Let me try again. The recurrence is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, n=1: a_1=4. n=2: a_2=1 +3*4=13. n=3: a_3=1 +3*13=40. So, the general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. Let's solve it again. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^{n}. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} -1/2 =>4=3A -0.5 =>3A=4.5 =>A=1.5=3/2. Therefore, the correct formula is a_n=(3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4, correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40, correct. Therefore, the correct formula is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Because (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10=59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2=59,048/2=29,524, which matches the step-by-step computation. Therefore, a_9=29,524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. So, earlier, I had a mistake in the formula because I incorrectly set A=9/2, but it should be A=3/2. Therefore, the correct formula is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers.

So, it seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented by a geometric series or some recursive formula. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Each subsequent layer is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recursive relation. The general formula for such a recursive sequence can be found. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Hmm, but let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me verify each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct.

Then, 3*29524: Let me compute this again more carefully. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. Wait, I think I'm making this more complicated. Alternatively, I can break it down as 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000. 87000 + 1500 is 88500. 88500 + 60 is 88560. 88560 + 12 is 88572. So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but that seems really large. Maybe I should check my layers again because each time I added 3 times the previous layer, and each time the numbers were growing exponentially. Let me see: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4: a_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let's see. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Since there are 9 layers, the innermost is 1 + 3. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps the expression can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to express E as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Let me expand it step by step. Let me consider that each layer adds a term. Let me think of it as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). There are 9 layers, so each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and this happens 9 times. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Wait, the expression is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but with a twist because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. Let me try to model it as a sum. Let me think recursively. Let me denote S(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So, S(n) = 3*(1 + S(n-1)), with S(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, that's the same recurrence as before. So, S(n) = 3*(1 + S(n-1)) with S(1)=4. So, as we saw earlier, S(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, S(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then E = 3*S(9) = 88572. So, that's another way to see it. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with 9 layers. So, each layer adds a 1 and multiplies by 3. So, the total expression can be expanded as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this expression without substituting each layer. Let me see how many 1's and 3's there are. Each time, we have a 1, and then a 3 multiplied by another term. So, expanding, we have:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me try to write it out step by step:\n\nFirst, the innermost part is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a base-3 number or something, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a geometric series. Let me consider that each time we add a 1 and multiply by 3, so the total sum can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see: The expression E is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). Let me expand this expression:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand each layer step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see a pattern in the numbers:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3 + 1\n\nLayer 2: 13 = 3*4 + 1 = 12 +1\n\nLayer 3: 40 = 3*13 +1 = 39 +1\n\nLayer 4: 121 = 3*40 +1 = 120 +1\n\nLayer 5: 364 = 3*121 +1 = 363 +1\n\nLayer 6: 1093 = 3*364 +1 = 1092 +1\n\nLayer 7: 3280 = 3*1093 +1 = 3279 +1\n\nLayer 8: 9841 = 3*3280 +1 = 9840 +1\n\nLayer 9: 29524 = 3*9841 +1 = 29523 +1\n\nSo, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, it's a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we found earlier. So, for n=9, it's (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can write out the entire expression as a sum. Let me try that. Each time, when we expand the expression, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the total expression can be represented as a sum of 1's multiplied by powers of 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. So, for example, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next 1 is multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1. Then, the total sum would be the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k, multiplied by 3, since the entire expression is 3 times that sum. Wait, let me think carefully.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each time, the 1 is added and then multiplied by 3. So, each 1 is at a different depth. Let me try to write it as a sum:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))).\n\nEach 1 is part of a term that's being multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me try to expand it:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count how many 1's there are. Each layer adds another 1, so there are 9 layers, meaning 9 ones. But actually, each layer adds a 1 and a 3, so maybe the number of 1's is equal to the number of layers. Let me see:\n\nWait, no, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, the number of 1's is equal to the number of layers. So, with 9 layers, there are 9 ones. Each of these ones is multiplied by 3 raised to the power corresponding to their depth. So, the innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1. Then, the entire expression inside the first 3 is the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k. Therefore, the sum inside is S = sum_{k=0}^8 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Wait, but that's just the sum inside. Then, the entire expression is 3*S = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that contradicts what I had earlier because Layer 9 was 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, so perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of terms is different. Let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each time, we have a 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, each 1 is at a different level. Let me try to model this as a sum.\n\nLet me denote the number of layers as n=9. Then, each 1 is multiplied by 3^{n-1}, 3^{n-2}, ..., 3^0. So, the sum inside is sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k = (3^n -1)/2. Then, the entire expression E is 3*(sum). So, E = 3*( (3^n -1)/2 ) = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. Let me test this with n=1: E = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. According to the formula, (3^{2} - 3)/2 = (9 -3)/2 = 6/2 = 3. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, let's take n=1: The expression is 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. According to the formula I just wrote, (3^{2} - 3)/2 = (9 -3)/2=3, which is incorrect. So, my formula is wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula. Let me try to model the expression correctly. Let me denote S(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So, S(n) = 3*(1 + S(n-1)), with S(1) = 4. As we saw earlier, S(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, S(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is E = 3*S(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me try to expand E:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))).\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, expanding all the parentheses, we get:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me try to write this as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\n= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nEach 1 is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Let me see how many times each 1 is multiplied. The innermost 1 is multiplied by 3 eight times (since there are 9 layers, so 8 multiplications by 3). The next 1 is multiplied by 3 seven times, and so on, until the outermost 1, which is not multiplied by 3 at all (since it's just 1). So, the sum inside the first 3 is:\n\n1*3^8 + 1*3^7 + 1*3^6 + ... + 1*3^0.\n\nThat's the sum from k=0 to k=8 of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is (3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841.\n\nSo, the sum inside is 9841, then E = 3*9841 = 29523. Wait, but that's different from what I had earlier. Wait, no, that can't be because earlier I had E = 3*(sum inside) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of terms. Let me think again. If there are 9 layers, each adding a 1, then the sum inside is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. Then, E = 3*9841 = 29523. But earlier, when I computed step by step, I got E = 88572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's check with n=1: If n=1, the expression is 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. According to the sum method, sum inside is sum_{k=0}^{0} 3^k = 1, so E = 3*1 = 3, which is wrong. So, the sum method is giving me the wrong result, which means I must be miscounting the number of terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of terms is different. Let me consider that each layer adds a 1, but each 1 is at a different depth. Let me try with n=2: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). So, innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, then 3*(4) = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13, then 3*13 = 39. So, E = 39. According to the sum method, sum inside is sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4, then E = 3*4 = 12, which is wrong because the actual result is 39. So, the sum method isn't working here. Therefore, my approach is incorrect. So, I must have made a mistake in modeling the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that each 1 is multiplied by 3^{n-1}, but the way the expression is nested, each 1 is at a different level. Let me try to model it correctly.\n\nWait, let me think of the expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))). So, with n layers, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, for n=1, it's 3*(1 + 3) = 12.\n\nFor n=2, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39.\n\nFor n=3, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, but according to the sum method, for n=3, the sum inside would be sum_{k=0}^{2} 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, then E = 3*13 = 39, which is correct for n=2, but for n=3, it's 3*(sum) = 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 3*13 = 39, which is incorrect because the actual value is 120. So, clearly, the sum method isn't capturing the correct value because each layer's 1 is being multiplied by a different power of 3 based on its depth.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that each 1 is multiplied by 3 raised to the number of layers above it. Let me try to model it correctly.\n\nLet me think of each 1 as being at a certain depth. The innermost 1 is at depth 8 (since there are 9 layers), so it's multiplied by 3^8. The next 1 is at depth 7, so multiplied by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is at depth 0, multiplied by 3^0=1. So, the sum inside is sum_{k=0}^{8} 3^k = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841. Then, E = 3*9841 = 29523. But when I computed step by step, I got E = 88572, which is 3*29524, where 29524 is the sum inside. So, perhaps the sum inside is actually sum_{k=0}^{9} 3^k, which would be (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for n layers, the sum inside would be sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, sum inside is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check with n=1: sum inside is sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k = 1 + 3 = 4, then E = 3*4 = 12, which is correct. For n=2: sum inside is sum_{k=0}^{2} 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, then E = 3*13 = 39, which is correct. For n=3: sum inside is sum_{k=0}^{3} 3^k = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, then E = 3*40 = 120, which is correct. So, yes, the sum inside is sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k, where n is the number of layers. So, for n=9, sum inside is (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then E = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572. I think I've verified it multiple ways now, so I'm confident that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe outermost expression is \\(3 \\times 29524\\).

    "text": " 3 * 4 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, then 1 + 3*40 = 121, 1 + 3*121 = 364, 1 + 3*364 = 1093, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gives 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's substitute into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} Let's plug in the general solution: C*3^n + D = 1 + 3*(C*3^{n-1} + D) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*C*3^{n-1} + 3*D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Now, equate both sides: C*3^n + D = 1 + C*3^n + 3D Subtract C*3^n from both sides: D = 1 + 3D Subtract 3D from both sides: -2D = 1 => D = -1/2 Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 + D = 3C - 1/2 = 4. So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2 = 81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, the innermost layer was a_1=4, which corresponds to n=1. Then, each subsequent layer is a_n where n increases by 1 each time. Wait, actually, in the problem, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost as a_1, then a_2, up to a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (previous layer). By iteratively computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4.

Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) (another term).

Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original problem has nine layers, each being 1 + 3(...), so a_9 is indeed the value inside the outermost parentheses, and then we multiply by 3.\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nIn this case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches our previous result.\n\nSo, using both methods, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, putting it together: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, but actually, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication and addition, so it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me check that. For n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1. But L_1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and has the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The standard solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^{n} + d, where d is the particular solution. To find d, set L_n = d, then d = a*d + b. Solving for d: d = (b)/(1 - a) = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, as we saw earlier. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same answer without computing each layer manually. That was a good exercise because it showed me that recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation can save time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for this problem, since there are only nine layers, computing step by step is manageable, though time-consuming. In any case, both methods lead me to the same final answer: 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two methods corroborate each other.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation. The general form is a linear recurrence, which might have a closed-form solution. Let me recall the formula for such a recurrence. If I have a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 (from Layer 1), then the closed-form solution can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation, but since it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence, perhaps I can find a pattern or use iteration. Let me try to write out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with an added constant each time. The general formula for such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's test it with n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I need to adjust the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a_n = 3^{n} + something. Let me see: Let's assume a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Let's plug into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, that's a_1. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, that's a_2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is a_9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 =88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I double-checked each layer, found a closed-form formula, and even computed it in two different ways to confirm. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made an error in adding or multiplying. Alternatively, I can compute 3 * 29524 directly. Let's do that: 29524 * 3.

Each layer builds on the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's a recursive-like pattern. Alternatively, I could recognize this as a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it might form a geometric progression. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Let's denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with eight layers inside. Wait, but actually, since the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3*(...), maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which would be the value inside the outermost 3*(...). Then, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, in this case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Then, E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that matches my earlier calculation. Alternatively, I can solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, E=3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula also leads me to the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

Hmm, that seems a bit large. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Maybe it's correct after all. Alternatively, I could approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1) Starting from Layer 1 = 4. This is a recursive relation, where each term depends on the previous one. In general, for such a recurrence relation, we can model it as a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for Layer n. The recurrence is: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1) This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is: Layer n - 3*(Layer n-1) = 0 The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Layer n^h = C*(3)^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say Layer n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = C*(3)^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n = 1, Layer 1 = 4. So: 4 = C*(3)^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*(3)^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: Layer 1 = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: Layer 2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: Layer 3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: Layer 4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: Layer 9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the final step is to multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, the final answer is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*((3^10 - 1)/2) = (3^11 - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11. 3^1 = 3 3^2 = 9 3^3 = 27 3^4 = 81 3^5 = 243 3^6 = 729 3^7 = 2187 3^8 = 6561 3^9 = 19683 3^10 = 59049 3^11 = 177147 Therefore, 3^11 - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, (177144)/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88,572 is correct. Just to recap, the key steps were recognizing the recursive structure of the problem, computing each layer from the inside out, and then using a formula derived from the recurrence relation to find the value more efficiently. It was a bit time-consuming, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. I was a bit worried about making an arithmetic mistake, especially with such large numbers, but double-checking each layer and then using the formula helped confirm that I didn't make any errors.

Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 Let me compute that again more carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's the expression inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3. So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, which might be time-consuming and error-prone. Let me think about whether there's a mathematical formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 and so on. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation to find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is 29524, and then we multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression using the formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^11 = 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the formula directly, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives us 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct.

So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of 3(...) terms. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: Each \"1+3(\" adds another layer. So starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The innermost is 1+3. Then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost as layer 1, the next is layer 2, and so on until the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" parts. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the first inner expression is 1+3(...), then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nWait, that's 9 layers? Or is it 8? Let me see. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first innermost is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences:\n\n- The innermost is 1+3\n- Then, moving out, each time we have 1+3(...), so let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first parenthesis after the first 3 is the innermost: 1+3\n- Then each subsequent parenthesis adds another layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression has 9 sets of \"1+3(...)\" starting from the innermost. Wait, no, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer.

Let me see: Each time I see a \"(\", it's a new layer. Let me count the number of \"(\" after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first \"(\" after 3 is the start of the first innermost expression. Then each subsequent \"(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of \"(\":\n\n1. After the first 3: (\n2. Then inside that: ( appears again: total 2\n3. And so on, until the last one.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers?\n\nWait, the problem is that each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, each time, we have a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1), and so on, up to layer 9, which is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so the innermost is 1+3, and each layer wraps around that. So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, and there are 9 of them.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had layers 1 through 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that seems correct. But just to make sure, let me check the number of layers again. Each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer, so up to layer 9.\n\nYes, that makes sense because the expression has 9 sets of \"1+3(\" after the initial 3. So, 9 layers in total.\n\nTherefore, my computation seems correct, and the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it another way to verify. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a linear recurrence relation is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + (a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) * b, where L_0 is the initial term.\n\nWait, in our case, L_1 = 4, so L_0 would be... Hmm, maybe it's better to adjust the formula.\n\nThe standard solution for L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is:\n\nL_n = a^{n} * (L_0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1)\n\nBut in our case, L_1 = 4, so maybe L_0 is undefined, or perhaps we can adjust the formula.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the recurrence starts at n=1 with L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, for n >=1, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1=4.\n\nWait, no, actually, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so it's L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the general solution for such a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = C * 3^{n} + (1)/(3 - 1) = C*3^{n} + 1/2\n\nWait, no, let me recall the method for solving such recursions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^{n}\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^p = K.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K + 1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1: L_1 = 4\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, which matches.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches.\n\nn=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 is correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have computed L_9 using the formula directly:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula instead of step by step.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify a particular method, either way is fine.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each time you go out a layer, the value increases significantly because you're multiplying by 3 each time. So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and finally multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression instead of computing each layer manually. Maybe it's a geometric series or something? Let me think. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The standard method to solve this is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer manually, which is much more efficient, especially if the number of layers increases. But since I only had nine layers, it wasn't too bad to compute step by step. It's also a good exercise to see how quickly these exponential functions grow. Each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, leading to exponential growth. So, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a formula, the result of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern that can be modeled with a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a specific formula. Applying this formula allows us to efficiently compute the result without manually calculating each layer. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but I just thought of something. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, but perhaps there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me recall the formula for such a recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Let me compute a_1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but a_1 is 4, so that's not matching. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me derive it properly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can use the method for linear recurrences. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to make sure. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = 4, correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 13, correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = 40, correct. n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = 121, correct. n=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = 364, correct. n=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = 1093, correct. n=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = 3280, correct. n=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841, correct. n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, correct. So, everything checks out. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

Yes, that's correct.\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*20 = 60\n\n3*4 = 12\n\nAdding these:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nBut when I compute 29524*3 directly, I get 87572. So which is correct? Let me use another method to verify. Let's compute 29524*3 using standard multiplication:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7    3\n\n--------\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nBut according to the addition method, it's 88572. So there's a mistake here. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I added incorrectly when breaking down. Let me add 60000 + 27000 again. 60000 + 27000 is indeed 87000.\n\nThen, 87000 + 1500 = 88500. Correct.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560. Correct.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572. So according to this, it's 88572.\n\nBut when I do the direct multiplication, I get 87572. There's a 1000 difference. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back to the layers and see if I made an error there.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364:\n\n364 \u00d7 3:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n6\u00d73=18 +1=19 \u2192 9, carryover 1.\n\n3\u00d73=9 +1=10 \u2192 0, carryover 1.\n\nSo, 364 \u00d7 3 = 1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093:\n\n1093 \u00d7 3:\n\n3\u00d73=9.\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u2192 7, carryover 2.\n\n0\u00d73=0 +2=2.\n\n1\u00d73=3.\n\nSo, 1093 \u00d73 = 3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280:\n\n3280 \u00d73:\n\n0\u00d73=0.\n\n8\u00d73=24 \u2192 4, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\n3\u00d73=9.\n\nSo, 3280 \u00d73=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841:\n\n9841 \u00d73:\n\n1\u00d73=3.\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n8\u00d73=24 +1=25 \u2192 5, carryover 2.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +2=29 \u2192 9, carryover 2.\n\nSo, 9841 \u00d73=29523. Layer 9: 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nNow, multiply by 3: 29524 \u00d73.\n\nWait, but when I did 29524 \u00d73 directly, I got 87572, but when I broke it down, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy of 1000. I must have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 \u00d73 again step by step:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nBut according to the breakdown, it's 88572. So, there's a mistake in the breakdown. Wait, 29524 \u00d73 is indeed 87572 because:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d73 as (30000 - 476) \u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's different. Wait, 29524 \u00d73 is 88572 because 29524 is 29524, so 29524 \u00d73 is indeed 88572, not 87572. So where did I go wrong in the direct multiplication?\n\nWait, in the direct multiplication, I think I misaligned the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n- Units place: 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n- Hundreds place: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n- Thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n- Ten-thousands place: 9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,7,7,8. So the number is 87572. But that contradicts the breakdown method which gave 88572. Wait, no, actually, 29524 \u00d73 is 88572 because 29524 \u00d73 is equal to (30000 - 476) \u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. So, I must have made a mistake in the direct multiplication. Let me check again:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the digits are 8 (from the hundred-thousands place), 7 (ten-thousands), 5 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 87572, but that's incorrect because 29524 \u00d73 is actually 88572. So, I must have miscounted the places. Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when multiplied by 3, it's a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the digits are: 8 (from the hundred-thousands place), 7 (ten-thousands), 5 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that's 87572. But that's wrong because 29524 \u00d73 should be 88572. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown method. Let me compute 29524 \u00d73 another way. Let's compute 29524 \u00d73 as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d73.\n\n20000\u00d73=60000\n\n9000\u00d73=27000\n\n500\u00d73=1500\n\n20\u00d73=60\n\n4\u00d73=12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nThis is correct. So, the direct multiplication must have an error. Let me check the direct multiplication again, perhaps I missed a carryover.\n\nWait, let's write it out properly:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n- Units place: 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n- Tens place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n- Hundreds place: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n- Thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n- Ten-thousands place: 9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n- Hundred-thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But according to the breakdown, it's 88572. There's a discrepancy. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me check the breakdown again.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d73 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 +27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. So, 88572 is correct. Therefore, the direct multiplication must have been done incorrectly. Let me try again, perhaps I miscounted the digits.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7    3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the digits are 8,7,5,7,2. Wait, that's 87572, but that's incorrect. So, perhaps the error is in the way I'm writing the digits. Let me write it properly, keeping track of each digit's place.\n\nWait, 29524 is:\n\n2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 units place: 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 tens place:7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 hundreds place:5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 thousands place:8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 ten thousands place:8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. When I multiplied the thousands place, I had 9\u00d73=27 +1=28, so I write down 8 and carryover 2. Then, the ten thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. That matches the breakdown method. So, my earlier direct multiplication was incorrect because I forgot to carryover properly when multiplying the thousands place. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any other mistakes in the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3 * 4 = 12 Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help confirm this result. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation here. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence relation: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n = 3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n = 4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n = 5: a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. For n = 6: a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. For n = 7: a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. For n = 8: a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. For n = 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the innermost layer a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer up to a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, my initial computation seems correct. Alternatively, I can also compute this using the formula. Since the expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer.

    "text": " 3 * 4 = 12 Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in multiplication or addition. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let me do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but let me check using another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think I did that correctly. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Each layer was computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then proceeding outward. Starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. Then, multiplying the last layer by 3 gives 88572. Yeah, that seems right. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

I guess another way to approach this might be to recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions, but since there are only nine layers, computing each one step by step seems manageable. If there were more layers, maybe I'd look for a recursive formula or something, but for nine layers, manual computation isn't too bad.
