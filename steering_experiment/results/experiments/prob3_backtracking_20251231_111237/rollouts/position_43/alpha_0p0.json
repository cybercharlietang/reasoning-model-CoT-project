Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's right. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe instead of computing each layer step by step, I can recognize a pattern or use a formula. Looking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I think my step-by-step calculation is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's find A and B. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, using both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems pretty big, but given the number of layers, it might make sense. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Finally, 3 * 29524: As I did earlier, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding them: 60000+27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. So, that seems correct. Let me just think if there's a smarter way to do this, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. It looks like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, each time, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can model this as a geometric series or something. Let me see. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, so each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. I remember that for such relations, the solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute that. First, compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer using the formula to see if it matches. Let's compute a_4 using the formula: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. So, the formula seems reliable. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By recognizing this as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute each layer efficiently. The nth layer is given by \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the outermost layer (n=9), we compute \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that matches. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error along the way. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a step, which would throw off all subsequent layers. Let me recompute each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). Okay, that seems consistent. So, I think my answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a function of the previous term. Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence relation is given by: L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. Wait, but in this case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula would be L_n = (L_1 - d)/(a - 1) * a^{n} + d, where d = b/(1 - a). Let me recall the standard solution for linear recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{hom} = C*a^n, and the particular solution is a constant if b is a constant. Let me try to find the particular solution. Assume L_p = K, a constant. Then, substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since our expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, using the formula, I could compute it directly without going through each layer. So, that's a good check. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, another thought: The original expression is 3*(...), so after computing Layer 9 as 29,524, we multiply by 3 to get 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Wait, actually, it's a recursive expression. Let me consider a general form. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the sequence is a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution will be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works. So, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think this is correct, but just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing a few more layers using the closed-form formula to see if it still holds. For example, a_4 should be 121. Using the formula: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Similarly, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, I can be confident that a_9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step manually might be simpler. However, if there were more layers, it would be useful to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be rewritten as a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c), which is a standard technique to solve such recursions. Let me try that. Let\u2019s assume that a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Expanding the right side: 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Then, a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. But from the original equation, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so substituting that in: (1 + 3*a_{n-1}) + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Simplify: 1 + 3*a_{n-1} + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c. Subtract 3*a_{n-1} from both sides: 1 + c = 3c. Then, 1 = 2c, so c = 1/2. Therefore, the sequence can be expressed as a_n + 1/2 = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1/2). This means that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1/2, but that might not be directly helpful here. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution. Let\u2019s try a constant particular solution a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the first few layers to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Perfect, the formula works. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.

Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Wait, 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 29523 + 1 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but I feel like that's a very large number. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have given me this result without computing each layer step by step. Maybe I can find a recursive formula or a closed-form expression. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers are there? Let me count again. Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) So, the first layer is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3: that's layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, the expression has 9 layers of 1+3(...). Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses: After the first 3, we have 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a new layer. So, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so a_n = (3^{9+1} -1)/2 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} directly: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3. Let me compute that again to verify: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the answer is 88,572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer approach and the recursive formula approach gave me the same result. Therefore, I think I'm done.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). We compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to see if there's a quicker way to compute it without calculating each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. This looks like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1 at the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write the recurrence relation as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The standard approach for such a linear recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches a_1. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, matches a_2. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct, matches a_3. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for the nth layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier when computing layer by layer. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88,572, as I calculated before. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, this gives me confidence that my answer is correct. I think I've got it then. The value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\). Solving this recurrence, we derive a general formula for the nth layer: \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the 9th layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct.

It looks similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula: 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. No mistakes noticed this time.

Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see, maybe it's easier to solve it as a linear recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have computed each layer step by step, as I did before, but using the formula is more efficient, especially for larger n. But since I only had to compute up to layer 9, it wasn't too bad either way. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value and then multiply the outermost result by 3. Using a recursive formula, we determine the final value is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), which resembles the formula for a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. Let me try to model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ... And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Now, looking at the recursion: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. That matches my earlier calculation. So, that's a good confirmation. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is building up a number in base 3 or something, but I think the recurrence approach is more straightforward here. Let me just confirm 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yep, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute that again: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3*(...), which can be solved by expanding from the innermost layer outward. Each layer follows a pattern that can be modeled with a recurrence relation, leading to a geometric progression which simplifies the computation. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern allows us to compute it step by step without having to model the entire recurrence, though the recurrence gives a more elegant mathematical solution. Either way, the result is the same.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication or in any of the layers. Let me recompute Layer 9: Layer 8 was 9841, so Layer 9 is 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9841 * 3. Let me compute that: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this gives 29524. Multiplying this by 3 yields the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recompute Layer 9 and the final multiplication to be sure. So, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) where Layer 7 was 3280. So, 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Then Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. So that part seems correct. Now, 3*29524: Let's compute it differently. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523.

Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that's consistent.

Hmm, that seems like a big number, but considering the multiple layers of multiplication, it might be correct. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used to compute this more efficiently without calculating each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on, up to a_9. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. At n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n is following a geometric progression, and thus, the closed-form formula would have saved time instead of computing each layer. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step without errors, both methods lead to the same result. I think this makes sense. Each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which causes the numbers to grow exponentially, hence the large final number. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, starting from Layer 1: a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4 a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined by a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4. Then, the problem is asking for 3*a\u2089. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a\u2099. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a\u2099 - 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081 = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3\u207f, where A is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a\u2099 = C. Substituting into the recurrence relation: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3\u00b9 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few terms. For n=1: a\u2081 = (3\u00b2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a\u2082 = (3\u00b3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a\u2083 = (3\u2074 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. Good, so the formula seems valid. Therefore, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2. Let me compute 3\u00b9\u2070. 3\u00b9=3, 3\u00b2=9, 3\u00b3=27, 3\u2074=81, 3\u2075=243, 3\u2076=729, 3\u2077=2187, 3\u2078=6561, 3\u2079=19683, 3\u00b9\u2070=59049. So, a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Let me explore that. Starting from the innermost layer: a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4. a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40. Wait, that's 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. So, each time, it's adding another power of 3. So, in general, a\u2099 = 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2 + 3\u00b3 + ... + 3\u207f. Wait, but that's a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series is S = (r\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/(r - 1). So, in this case, r=3, so S = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 -1)/2. Which is exactly the formula I derived earlier. So, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 -1)/2. Therefore, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a\u2089 = 88572. So, all methods point to the same answer. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct result. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result. 3. Derive a general formula using recurrence relations and verify it with the initial terms. 4. Alternatively, recognize the pattern as a geometric series and use the sum formula. 5. Confirm the result using multiple methods to ensure accuracy. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4.

After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 + 3 times the next nested term.

Then, Layer 5 is 1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 7: Layer 6 is 1093. So, 3*1093=3279. Then, Layer 7 is 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 9: Layer 8 is 9841. 3*9841=29523. Then, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, each layer seems to be correctly computed. Then, the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the previous term. If I can model this, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. Let me denote a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} So, A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B So, equating both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I computed earlier. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524 *3=88572. Correct.

So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's right. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since the innermost layer is a_1=4, and each subsequent layer is built outward, up to layer 9, which is the outermost before multiplying by 3. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer and verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this seems like it might be a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, starting from Layer 1 = 4, Layer 2 = 13, Layer 3 = 40, etc. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for Layer n. The recurrence is: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), with Layer 1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition, when n=1, Layer 1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could have used the formula from the start, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step without making a mistake, that also works. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression: \n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we can work from the innermost parentheses outward, computing each layer step by step.

Let me compute this again using another method to confirm. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 4*3=12, write down 12. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to compute it as 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000 9000*3=27000 500*3=1500 20*3=60 4*3=12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that's the same as before. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Hmm, but wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think I counted nine layers correctly. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let's count them: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each time we go out, another 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my calculation of nine layers seems correct. Therefore, the final result should indeed be 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote L_n as the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, and so on up to L_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, perhaps I can find a general formula for L_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. But L_n should also be equal to A*3^n + B. Therefore, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers: For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result again. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression E=3*L_9=3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11=177147. So, E=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recursive formula, or find a closed-form expression, I end up with the same answer: 88,572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1) with Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's denote Layer n as a_n, then:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. Let's write the recurrence in standard form:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as I computed earlier. So, that confirms the answer. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} =177147. Therefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or using a derived formula, the final result is found to be 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me check that again because 3*29524 might be better computed as 29524 * 3. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me verify the layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing one of them. Let me go through each layer again to make sure. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check once more to be sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's say we have an expression like x = 1 + 3x. Solving for x would give x = 1 + 3x => x - 3x = 1 => -2x = 1 => x = -1/2. But in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), so maybe the value converges if it's infinite, but since we have a finite number of layers, it's a bit different. Wait, but perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed earlier. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on up to a_9. So, since we have 9 layers, the outermost expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_1 to a_9 again to confirm. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a formula for a_n in such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it's a non-homogeneous one. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Let's plug n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm applying the formula correctly. Since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 =4, so the nth term is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\(3 \\times 29524\\).

So, yes, that checks out. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or something similar, but given that it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. However, if there were more layers, perhaps a formula would be more efficient. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula here. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1) with Layer 1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The recurrence is: Layer n = 3*Layer n-1 + 1, with Layer 1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method for such equations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving the equation: x = 3x, which gives x=0, but that's trivial. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say Layer n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: Layer 1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with our earlier results. For n=1: Layer 1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: Layer 2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: Layer3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, Layer9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the formula derived for such a recurrence relation, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, I think my calculations are correct. Alternatively, I could use another approach to verify. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to find a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I computed each layer up to Layer 9, which is correct. Then multiplying by 3 gives the final result. So, I think I did it correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equate both sides: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 =81 -1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, but since I was unsure at first, computing each layer step by step was a good approach to avoid mistakes.

But I feel like the number is a bit large, so maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here.

Maybe I should check with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds. Let's say, for example, if there was only one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nIf there are two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nThree layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nWait, but according to my earlier calculations, a_3 = 40, so 3*a_3 = 120. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, four layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) = 3*(1 + 3*40) = 3*121 = 363, which matches a_4 = 121, so 3*a_4 = 363.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, a_4 was 121, which is correct, and 3*a_4 is 363.

Let me write down the expression with numbering:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n...\nUp to the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps I have 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3(...). So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, ending at Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut let me verify the number of layers by counting the opening parentheses. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by a 3 and a parenthesis, so each layer adds another set.

Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 should be 4.\n\nPlugging in n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nUsing the formula: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nFormula: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for n layers, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, L_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using a recursive formula, we determine that the value of the ninth layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).
