    "text": " Wait, maybe it's better to just do 29524 * 3. Let me compute it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading from top, 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that seems off. Wait, let me do it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, no carryover.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo putting it together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and verify each step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. But wait, let me try another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series, but it's not exactly a standard geometric series because each term is 1 + 3 times the previous. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recurrence relation.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution would be found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence relation: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2=88572\n\nYes, that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute each layer again using the formula.\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9=88572\n\nAlternatively, I can compute each layer step by step again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's the same as before.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm pretty sure the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I should compute it directly: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.

So adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a geometric series perhaps? Let me think about that. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n starts at 1 for the innermost. So L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be expressed as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9:\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Okay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is a series of nested 1 + 3(...) expressions, nine layers deep, and then multiplied by 3. I computed each layer from the inside out, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, and then finally multiplied the result by 3 again.

So, adding up each part: 60000 + 27000=87000, 87000 +1500=88500, 88500 +60=88560, 88560 +12=88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, but that seems like a very large number. I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me try to represent this as a recurrence. Let\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can write a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches our earlier computation. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. That's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. We know that a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to look at it using the formula. I think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on that. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a formula to compute the value of each layer, leading to the final result after multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each term is 1 + 3*(next term).

The general term is found to be a\u2099 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n4. **Compute the Final Expression**: Multiply the ninth layer by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, each layer L_n is equal to (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. That's a useful formula. So, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 29524, which matches what I calculated earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*(29524) = 88572. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 ) = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 -3 =177144. Then, 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the inner layer by 3 and adding 1. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be calculated step by step. Using the formula for the nth layer, L_n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer follows this pattern. The outermost layer (Layer 9) is 29524, and multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let me recalculate each layer step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, same result. But wait, maybe I'm miscounting the layers. Let me count the number of layers again. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Starting from the first innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...): Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me write them out:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each adding another 3(...). So my earlier calculation of 9 layers is correct. So Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I'm miscounting the layers because the initial expression is 3*(...), so perhaps the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9, but when I compute Layer 9, that's already the innermost part. Wait, no, that can't be. Let me try to parse the expression correctly. Let me write it with more parentheses clarity:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen moving out: (1 + 3*4) = 13\n\nThen (1 + 3*13) = 40\n\nThen (1 + 3*40) = 121\n\nThen (1 + 3*121) = 364\n\nThen (1 + 3*364) = 1093\n\nThen (1 + 3*1093) = 3280\n\nThen (1 + 3*3280) = 9841\n\nThen (1 + 3*9841) = 29524\n\nThen the outermost is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinal step: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since it's only 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form solution.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard form is a_n + c1*a_{n-1} + ... = f(n). In this case, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers from the innermost to the outermost), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the result is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident in the answer. It's a large number, but given the repeated multiplications by 3, it makes sense that the result is quite big.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the value of the innermost expression to be 29,524. Finally, multiplying this by 3 gives the result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, plus another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3n, where n is the previous layer. So, each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation: a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the sequence would be a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Then, the final answer is 3*a_9=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me think about it. The recurrence relation is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence, so I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_k = C*3^{k} + D, where C and D are constants. Let me find D. If the recurrence is a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, then in steady state, a_k = a_{k-1} = a. So, a = 1 + 3a => a - 3a = 1 => -2a = 1 => a = -1/2. So, the homogeneous solution is a_k = C*3^k, and the particular solution is a constant a = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. k=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. k=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. So, for k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also compute this using the formula. Since a_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2, then the expression we're computing is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

So I must have added incorrectly earlier when I thought it was 88560. So the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the layers again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the layers:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1: 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I first did the multiplication, I thought it was 88560, but now it's 88572. I think the confusion came from how I broke down the multiplication earlier. Let me confirm once more:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 88500 + 60 = 88560\n\nWait, but that's 88560, but the digit-by-digit multiplication gave me 88572. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try that again:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So that's 88572.\n\nBut when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20, I got 88560. That suggests that I made an error in that breakdown. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? No, that's not correct. 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. So when I do 29524 * 3, it's (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\nSo, 20000*3=60000\n\n9000*3=27000 \u2192 60000+27000=87000\n\n500*3=1500 \u2192 87000+1500=88500\n\n20*3=60 \u2192 88500+60=88560\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 88560+12=88572\n\nAh, I see where I went wrong earlier. I stopped at 20*3=60, adding to 88560, but I forgot to add the last digit, which is 4*3=12. So the correct total is 88572.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nEach layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost.\n\nAfter computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final answer, which is 88572.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursion. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s say that each term is of the form T_n = 1 + 3*T_{n-1}, where T_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost term is T_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen T_2 = 1 + 3*T_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nT_3 = 1 + 3*T_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to T_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is T_n = a + r*T_{n-1}, where a = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is T_n = a*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1) + (T_0)*r^{n}, but I might be mixing up the formula. Alternatively, since it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation, we can solve it as follows.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is T_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant solution T_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is T_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition T_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is T_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSo T_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: T_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: T_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: T_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, it works. So, for Layer n, T_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9:\n\nT_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo T_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*T_9 =3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using the formula, we arrive at the same result, which confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern T_n = 1 + 3*T_{n-1}, starting with T_1 = 4. Using this recurrence relation, each subsequent layer is computed until the outermost layer (T_9) is reached. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3 to get the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Compute the innermost parentheses:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. **Proceed outward, computing each layer:**\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - Final Result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Okay, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me make sure that I correctly computed each layer because if I messed up any of the layers, the final answer would be wrong. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. In this case, a = 3, b = 1. So, the solution would be L_n = 3^{n} * C + (1)/(1 - 3) = 3^{n} * C - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = 3^{1} * C - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this works for n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula seems to work. Therefore, for layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, yes, the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, since the entire expression is 3*(L_9), and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. That confirms it again. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the different approaches all lead to the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 3 * 24 = 72 Wait, maybe breaking it down digit by digit would be better. Let me write 29524 as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Let me see what each a_n is: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 13 a_3 = 40 a_4 = 121 a_5 = 364 a_6 = 1093 a_7 = 3280 a_8 = 9841 a_9 = 29524 Looking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a recursive formula or a closed-form expression that could represent a_n. Let's see, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. The standard form for such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r and c are constants. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*r^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me apply that here. So, a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging in the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, we can plug the particular solution into the recurrence. Assuming a particular solution is B, then B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, that's a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I have: For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for a_9. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the general formula, I can compute it without having to compute each layer individually. That's a good time-saver and reduces the chance of making arithmetic errors. So, just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By recognizing the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, I was able to compute the value efficiently. Alternatively, computing each layer step by step also led me to the same answer, confirming its correctness. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...).

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L9 = (3^10 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 88572 as the final answer, but I feel like that's a big number. Let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the innermost: Each \"1+3\" is a layer. So from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each next layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3\" appears. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of 1+3 expressions. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's count the number of 1+3 terms:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then, moving out, each time we have 1+3(something). So the number of layers is 9, right? Because starting from the innermost, each time you have a 1+3(...) until you reach the outermost. So Layer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer 1)\n...\nLayer 9: 1+3(Layer 8)\n\nYes, that's correct.

So, a9=29524, and the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a formula for a_n without computing each term. Since it's a linear recurrence relation, maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C -1/2 =4\n\nSo, 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, after verifying with both iterative computation and a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 *3 = (29000 + 524)*3 = 29000*3 +524*3=87000 + 1572=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and use it to compute the next layer, continuing until we reach the outermost layer. Finally, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Maybe breaking it down differently: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier when adding up the parts. Let me correct that. 29524 * 3: Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 Correct. Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Correct. Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Correct. Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Correct. Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Correct. Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it that way to confirm. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, this method confirms the answer. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each layer's value. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check my multiplication again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3 is 88572. Hmm, I think I made a mistake in my earlier step-by-step addition. Let me correct that. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Then Layer 2: 1 +3*4=13. Layer 3:1 +3*13=40. Layer4:1 +3*40=121. Layer5:1 +3*121=364. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern in the layers. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found, but since the number of layers is finite (9 layers), computing each step is manageable. Let me check if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute it more efficiently. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me compute the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern. a1=4 a2=1 +3*4=13 a3=1 +3*13=40 a4=1 +3*40=121 a5=1 +3*121=364 a6=1 +3*364=1093 a7=1 +3*1093=3280 a8=1 +3*3280=9841 a9=1 +3*9841=29524 So, each term is indeed 1 + 3 times the previous term. Now, to find a general formula for a_n, I can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. Either way, the answer is 88572. I think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me add these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let's do that: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in breaking it down. Let me do it properly: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 write 7, carry 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 write 7, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7 8 7 5 7 2 4? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me write it out step by step:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\nUnits place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 units digit is 2, carryover is 1.\n\nTens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7 \u2192 tens digit is 7, carryover is 0.\n\nHundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds digit is 5, carryover is 1.\n\nThousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 thousands digit is 7, carryover is 0.\n\nTen-thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 \u2192 ten-thousands digit is 7, carryover is 2.\n\nHundred-thousands place: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 hundred-thousands digit is 7, carryover is 1.\n\nMillions place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 millions digit is 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I broke it down into parts, I got 88560, which is different. So, clearly, I made a mistake in that method. The correct way is to compute each digit as above, resulting in 88572.\n\nSo, to confirm, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my computations for each layer because if any of those layers was computed incorrectly, the final answer would be off.\n\nStarting over, let me compute each layer step by step again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent now.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again because 3*1093: 1093 * 3. Let's compute that:\n\n1000 * 3 = 3000\n\n90 * 3 = 270\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nAdding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. So, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280 * 3:\n\n3000 * 3 = 9000\n\n200 * 3 = 600\n\n80 * 3 = 240\n\n0 * 3 = 0\n\nAdding them up: 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840 + 0 = 9840. So, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841 * 3:\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n800 * 3 = 2400\n\n40 * 3 = 120\n\n1 * 3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original problem is 3 times the entire expression, which is up to Layer 9. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n ranges from 1 to 9.\n\nGiven that L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nAnd for each subsequent layer, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo, L_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, as we computed earlier.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, where a=1 and b=3.\n\nThe solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0, where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L_1 is the first term. Let me adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for L_n when L_n = a + b*L_{n-1} is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0.\n\nBut since L_1 = a + b*L_0, and if we consider L_0 as the base case, then L_1 = a + b*L_0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as starting from L_1.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the expression is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think this is correct. I've checked it multiple ways: step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer's value is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier when adding. Let me correct that. So, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make any errors in the intermediate steps. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093 is 3279, so 3279 + 1 = 3280. Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So 29523 +1=29524. Correct) Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. Hmm, I notice that each L_n seems to be following a pattern. Let me compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern or a formula. Let's compute L_1 to L_9:\n\nL_1 = 4\nL_2 = 13\nL_3 = 40\nL_4 = 121\nL_5 = 364\nL_6 = 1093\nL_7 = 3280\nL_8 = 9841\nL_9 = 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me think about the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => 0 = 1 + 2A => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, for the 9th layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the formula.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). This is a geometric series with ratio 3, but each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Wait, actually, when expanded, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try to express this as a sum.\n\nWait, let me consider the entire expression. Let me denote the entire expression as E.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me try to express E in terms of itself. But it's a bit tricky because each layer is similar but not exactly the same. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and we have 9 layers, maybe we can use the formula we derived earlier.\n\nBut since we've already computed it step by step and using the formula, I think we're confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top: 88572. Correct.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we confirm that the 9th layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Starting from the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 I think that's correct. Each step seems to follow logically, and the multiplication checks out. So I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Let me check my multiplication again because 3*29524 should be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Layer 9. Let me double-check each layer's computation to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading the numbers from bottom up: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So 88572.\n\nWait, that's what I got earlier. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but I feel like that's a big number, but considering the layers, maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way to be absolutely sure. Maybe I can compute the expression step by step, layer by layer, just to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524\n\nNow, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. So, if I expand the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))).\n\nIf I let S be the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But that seems recursive, which is similar to the recurrence relation I had before. Maybe that's why the closed-form worked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent this as a sum. Let me see:\n\nEach time we have a term 1 + 3*(...), so expanding each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))\n\nAnd so on. If I expand all the way, each layer adds a power of 3 multiplied by 1.\n\nWait, so maybe the entire expression can be represented as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's see: The innermost term is 1 +3, which is 4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 +3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWhich is the same recurrence as before.\n\nBut if I expand a_n, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 1 +3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to n terms.\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct because each layer is 1 +3*something, which isn't just adding another 3^k. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent a_n as a geometric series. Since a_n = 1 +3*a_{n-1}, and a_1=4, which is 1 +3.\n\nThen, a_2=1 +3*4=13=1 +3 +3^2\n\na_3=1 +3*13=40=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3\n\nWait, that's not matching because 1 +3 +9 +27=40, yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_4=1 +3*40=121=1 +3 +9 +27 +81=121\n\nYes, so it seems that a_n = 1 +3 +3^2 +3^3 +...+3^{n}\n\nWhich is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0=1 up to 3^{n}\n\nSo, the sum S = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} -1)/(3 -1) )= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nWhich matches the closed-form solution I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculations.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer step by step once more to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps.\n\nLayer 1:1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nMultiply by 3:29524*3=88572\n\nYes, all the layers check out, and the final multiplication is correct.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost outwards, we find each layer's value and then multiply the outermost layer by 3. Using a closed-form solution for the recurrence relation confirms that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, I must have miscounted the digits. Let me try again.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).

Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. I think I did this correctly. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the repetitive steps.\n\nLooking at the layers, each Layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nThe recursive formula is: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4.\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4.

Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1 =59,048. Divide by 2: 29,524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, Layer 9 is 29,524.

Yep, that's the same result.\n\nSo, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer: 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Let's break down 29524 into digits: 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here, perhaps recognizing that each layer is following a geometric progression or some recursive formula. Let me see if there's a formula for such nested expressions. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) with n layers. In this case, n=9. So, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested multiplication. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we can compute a_n recursively. Let me compute a few terms to see if there's a pattern: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Now, is there a closed-form formula for a_n? Let's try to derive it. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. The particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, that seems correct. But wait, let me check if I have the right number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of (1+3(...)) parts. Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then, each subsequent Layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Each time, it's 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then 1+3(1+3), then 1+3(1+3(1+3)), and so on. Each layer adds one more 1+3. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of 1+3 sections. Let me see: Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1+3, and each layer is one more. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then Layer 2: 1+3(1+3). Layer 3: 1+3(1+3(1+3)). And so on, until Layer 9: 1+3(1+3(...)) nine times. Wait, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, Layer 9 is the outermost parentheses, which is 1+3*(Layer 8). So, yes, there are nine layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, my computation from Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct, with each layer building on the previous one. Therefore, the final result after computing Layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, let me try to compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have a simpler version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Let's compute that step by step. Innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Then, 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Which matches my step-by-step computation. So, that works. Let's try another one with three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3*4) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in the two-layer example, I think I miscalculated. Wait, no, the three-layer example would be 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). So, innermost: 1+3=4. Then, 1+3*4=13. Then, 1+3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. So, yes, that's correct. So, my method works for smaller cases, so I can be confident it works for the larger problem. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4.\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4.\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9.\n\nWait, actually, in my initial approach, I labeled the innermost as layer 1, which corresponds to n=1, so a_1=4, which matches the formula: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Which matches what I computed earlier. Good.\n\nTherefore, the value at layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirmed the result I got by computing each layer step by step.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also try to see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, but since it's only nine layers, computing step by step is manageable. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation, and solving it might give a closed-form expression. Let me think about that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging in the initial condition: When n=1, a_1=4= A*3^1 + B=3A + B. Also, for the recurrence to hold, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Let me solve for A and B. Let's assume a particular solution is a constant B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Now, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition: a_1=4= A*3^1 -1/2= 3A -1/2. So, 3A=4 +1/2=9/2. Therefore, A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By systematically computing each layer, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. This expression is a form of a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the sequence is a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, and so on. Wait, but this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572.

Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could notice a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\na_2=1 +3*a_1=1 +12=13\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +39=40\n\na_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +120=121\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be expressed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the recurrence relation:\n\na_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nThen, a_{n} = A*3^{n} + B\n\nPlug into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B =1 +3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 +3*A*3^{n-1} +3*B =1 +A*3^{n} +3B\n\nSo, left side: A*3^{n} + B\n\nRight side: A*3^{n} +3B +1\n\nSet equal:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} +3B +1\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 3B +1\n\nThen, -2B =1 => B= -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B =3A + (-1/2)=4\n\nSo, 3A -1/2=4 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation allows us to find a closed-form solution, confirming the result through both iterative computation and formula application.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Define Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n represent the value of the nth layer, where:\n   - a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n   - a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1\n\n3. **Find the Closed-Form Solution**:\n   - The recurrence relation can be solved to find a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute for n=9**:\n   - a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**:\n   - The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"
