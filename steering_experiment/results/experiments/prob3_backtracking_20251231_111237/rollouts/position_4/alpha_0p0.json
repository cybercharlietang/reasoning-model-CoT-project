    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a recursive structure, where each layer is 3 times the next layer plus 1. So maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That seems like a logical approach because the innermost parentheses will be the simplest and easiest to compute first.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Let's denote each layer as follows:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd this continues until Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of layers to be sure. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, and I see that after the initial 3, there are 8 more sets of parentheses. So actually, there are 9 layers in total. Hmm, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). So let's see:\n\nThe innermost part is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that with another 1+3*(...). So starting from the inside:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are. Each time there's a closing parenthesis, that's the end of a layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then the next layer is (1+3*(1+3))\n- Then (1+3*(1+3*(1+3)))\n- And so on, until we have 9 layers.\n\nWait, actually, the original expression is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 8 more layers. So maybe it's 9 layers in total. Let me confirm by counting the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the first 3, then each time we have \"1+3(\" until the end. Let me count the number of \"1+3(\":\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nWait, that's 9 instances of \"1+3(\", so that means there are 9 layers. So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1+3), then Layer 2: (1+3*(Layer1)), up to Layer 9: (1+3*(Layer8)), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is (1+3*(Layer8)). So I need to compute Layer1 through Layer9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7\n\n5 *3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo 29524 *3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify:\n\n29524\n\n*        3\n\n---------\n\nLet's compute:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but wait a second, when I computed Layer9, I got 29524. Let me check that step again because that's where the multiplication by 3 happens, and then the final step is another multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, no, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me make sure that Layer9 is indeed 29524.\n\nLet me go back and recompute each layer step by step, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's correct. So Layer9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer9 again because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nLayer8 is 9841, so 3*9841=29523, then 1+29523=29524. That's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because when I saw the original expression, it's 3*(...), and the innermost is (1+3), which is 4, and then each layer is 1 +3*previous layer.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with 9 layers.\n\nI remember that expressions of the form a + b*(a + b*(a + b*(...))) can sometimes be expressed using a formula, especially if they're repeated multiple times. Let me think if there's a way to generalize this.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nWith L_1 = 1 + 3 =4\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}, where a is a constant and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, a=1 and r=3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a*(r^{n} -1)/(r -1) + (initial term). Wait, let me recall the formula correctly.\n\nActually, for a linear recurrence of the form L_n = a + r*L_{n-1}, the closed-form solution can be found by unfolding the recurrence.\n\nLet me try to compute L_n in terms of L_{n-1}, then L_{n-1} in terms of L_{n-2}, and so on.\n\nSo,\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nL_{n-1} = 1 + 3*L_{n-2}\n\nSubstituting back,\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this process,\n\nL_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L_{n-3}\n\nAnd so on, until we reach L_1.\n\nSince L_1 =4, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo, for L_n, the general form would be:\n\nL_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n * L_1\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, when we unfold L_n, each step adds a term of 3^k and multiplies the initial term by 3^{n-1}.\n\nWait, let me try to write it out more clearly.\n\nStarting from L_n:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nL_{n-1} = 1 + 3*L_{n-2}\n\nSo,\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_{n-2}\n\nSimilarly,\n\nL_{n-2} = 1 + 3*L_{n-3}\n\nSo,\n\nL_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*L_{n-3}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*L_{n-3}\n\nContinuing this pattern, after n-1 steps, we reach:\n\nL_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^{n} * L_1\n\nBut L_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3.\n\nWait, but L_1 is 1 +3, so L_1 =4.\n\nSo, substituting,\n\nL_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^{n} *4\n\nThe sum sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k is a geometric series with ratio 3, so it equals (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1) = (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore,\n\nL_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 + 4*3^{n}\n\nSimplify:\n\nL_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 + (8*3^{n})/2 = [3^{n} -1 +8*3^{n}]/2 = (9*3^{n} -1)/2\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, let's compute L_n again:\n\nL_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k + 3^{n}*L_1\n\nsum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k = (3^{n} -1)/2\n\nAnd L_1 =4, so:\n\nL_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 +4*3^{n}\n\nLet me combine these terms:\n\n= (3^{n} -1)/2 + (8*3^{n})/2\n\n= [3^{n} -1 +8*3^{n}]/2\n\n= [9*3^{n} -1]/2\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, L_n = (9*3^{n} -1)/2\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1.\n\nn=1: L_1 = (9*3^1 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. But wait, L_1 is supposed to be 4, not 13. Hmm, that's a problem. So my formula must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unfolding process.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me compute L_n step by step and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nWe have:\n\nL_1 =4\n\nL_2=1+3*4=13\n\nL_3=1+3*13=40\n\nL_4=1+3*40=121\n\nL_5=1+3*121=364\n\nL_6=1+3*364=1093\n\nL_7=1+3*1093=3280\n\nL_8=1+3*3280=9841\n\nL_9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nLooking at these numbers:4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524.\n\nI notice that each term is roughly 4 times the previous term, but let me check:\n\n13 /4 =3.25\n\n40 /13\u22483.077\n\n121 /40\u22483.025\n\n364 /121\u22483.008\n\n1093 /364\u22483.000\n\nSimilarly, 3280 /1093\u22483.000\n\n9841 /3280\u22483.000\n\n29524 /9841\u22483.000\n\nSo, as n increases, the ratio approaches 3, which makes sense because the recurrence is L_n=1+3*L_{n-1}.\n\nSo perhaps the closed-form formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} +1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test that.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} +1)/2=(9 +1)/2=10/2=5. But L_1 is 4, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe it's (3^{n} -1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3 -1)/2=1. No, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.\n\nLet me consider the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution satisfies L_n^{(h)} =3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)}=C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)}=A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA =1 +3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA -3A=1 => -2A=1 => A=-1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n= L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)}= C*3^{n} -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1=4.\n\nWhen n=1: L_1= C*3^{1} -1/2=3C -1/2=4\n\nSo, 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C=(9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n= (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\n(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works! So the closed-form formula is L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for Layer9, which is n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, L_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm using the formula.\n\nSince Layer9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to compute it, and it confirms the result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result:88572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Just to be thorough, let me check the multiplication again:29524*3.\n\n29524*3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2\n\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 30,000*3=90,000, and 29524 is 476 less than 30,000. So 29524*3=90,000 -476*3=90,000 -1,428=88,572. That also checks out.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost outwards. Each layer follows the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the ninth layer is reached. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the solution.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested parentheses, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). There are 9 layers in total.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Final Multiplication:** Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a chain, starting from the innermost part and working outwards. So, maybe the best way to tackle this is to start from the inside and work my way out. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nCounting the number of 3s, it seems like there are nine 3s multiplied in total, but I might be miscounting. Wait, actually, each opening parenthesis after the first one adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There's one after each 1, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and then each subsequent one adds another layer. Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. And so on, until the outermost layer.\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let me count each opening parenthesis after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each time we have a new layer. So, let's count:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like nine layers. So, each layer adds another 3 and another 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplied by the previous result.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outwards. That way, I can keep track of each value as I go.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but the original expression starts with 3*(...), so actually, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire expression inside. So, perhaps the layers go from 1 to 9, but the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). Let me check that.\n\nWait, let me parse the expression correctly. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on until Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that means after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply the result by 3.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, perhaps the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(Layer n-1) + 1, up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but when I count the layers, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), etc., up to Layer 9, and then the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, I have 9 layers inside, and then an outermost multiplication by 3. So, total of 10 layers? Wait, no, because the outermost is 3*(...), so the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and then the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). So, I have 9 layers inside, each defined as 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the outermost is 3 times the 9th layer.\n\nWait, let me confirm that by counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then the first (1+3(...)), then another (1+3(...)), etc. Let's see: after the initial 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, that would mean 9 layers inside, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the outermost 3*(Layer 9). So, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, to compute this, I can compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nLet me start computing each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524\n\nWell, 29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Wait, no, 29524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, no, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nWait, no, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24? Wait, no, 29,524 is 2*10,000 + 9*1,000 + 5*100 + 2*10 + 4*1.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7         3\n----------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 units digit is 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens digit is 7, no carryover\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands digit is 8, carryover 2\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten-thousands digit is 8\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20,000\u00d73 + 9,000\u00d73 + 500\u00d73 + 24\u00d73\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2192 Correct\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2192 Wait, earlier I wrote 1093, which is the same as 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2192 Correct\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2192 Correct\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2192 Correct\n\nThen, 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the manual computation.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7previous_layer. So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3\n\nL2 = 1 + 3\u00d7L1\n\nL3 = 1 + 3\u00d7L2\n\n...\n\nL9 = 1 + 3\u00d7L8\n\nAnd the total expression is 3\u00d7L9.\n\nThis looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Ln.\n\nLet me consider the recurrence relation:\n\nLn = 1 + 3\u00d7L(n-1), with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln - 3\u00d7L(n-1) = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A\u00d73^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3\u00d7C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nLn = A\u00d73^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1 = 4:\n\n4 = A\u00d73^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\nLn = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2\n\nSo, for L9, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^(10) - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2,187\n\n3^8 = 6,561\n\n3^9 = 19,683\n\n3^10 = 59,049\n\nSo, L9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524\n\nWhich matches the value I computed earlier. So, L9 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3\u00d7L9 = 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572, as before.\n\nSo, that confirms that the manual computation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following the formula Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2, so for n=9, L9 = (3^10 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524, and then 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572.\n\nThis seems like a solid approach, using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form solution, which avoids the need to compute each layer step by step. It's a good way to verify the result.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think about that.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each time we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, for example, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3 + 3^2.\n\nLayer 3 is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3.\n\nWait, so Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=n of 3^k, but that's not exactly correct because each layer is built by multiplying the previous sum by 3 and adding 1.\n\nWait, actually, the sum from k=0 to m of 3^k is (3^(m+1) - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula we found earlier for Ln. So, in this case, each layer Ln is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 1 is 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4, and that's equal to (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. So, yes, that works.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 2 is 13, which is (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nSo, indeed, each Layer n is equal to the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, up to 3^n.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 is (3^10 - 1)/2 = 59,049 - 1 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3\u00d729,524 = 88,572.\n\nThis approach using the geometric series formula is much more efficient and avoids the need to compute each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nIn summary, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula, or recognize the pattern as a geometric series, I arrive at the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the multiple methods all point to the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. We can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost part and working outwards.\n\nWe denote each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 1}\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 2}\\)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Layer 8}\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\).\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested series of terms, each starting with 1 plus 3 times something. It seems like a recursive structure where each layer depends on the one inside it. So, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. Starting from the inside:\n\nInnermost part: 1 + 3\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(previous result)\n\nAnd this pattern continues, so each time, I have 1 + 3*(something), and that something is the next layer out.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So:\n\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, let me check that again. 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is indeed 13. Okay, moving on.\n\n3. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13.\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). So, 1 + 3*40.\n\n3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4). So, 1 + 3*121.\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5). So, 1 + 3*364.\n\n3*364, let me compute that. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6). So, 1 + 3*1093.\n\n3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7). So, 1 + 3*3280.\n\n3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8). So, 1 + 3*9841.\n\nLet me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9). So, 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems quite large. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10. 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems each step checks out. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut wait a second, let me think if there's a more efficient way to compute this without manually computing each layer. Maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me denote each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say a\u2081 = 1 + 3, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081, a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082, and so on, up to a\u2089, since there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, we can model this as a recurrence relation where a\u2099 = 1 + 3a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a\u2099.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a\u2081=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3\u00b9 + B => 3A + B = 4.\n\nTo find another equation, let's compute a\u2082. a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the closed-form for n=2: a\u2082 = A*3\u00b2 + B = 9A + B.\n\nSo, 9A + B = 13.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. 3A + B = 4\n\n2. 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, plug A back into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2.\n\nSo, the closed-form is a\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. (3/2)*3\u207f = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2, so yes, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a\u2081 = (3\u00b2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=2: a\u2082 = (3\u00b3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nn=3: a\u2083 = (3\u2074 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, it matches.\n\nSo, for each layer, a\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the innermost is a\u2081, and the outermost is a\u2089. Then, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nSo, let's compute a\u2089 first.\n\na\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3\u00b9\u2070: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think this method is more efficient because it uses a formula instead of computing each layer manually. It's also a good way to verify the result without making arithmetic errors along the way.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations with the exponents, let me compute 3^10 again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, a\u2089 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000*3 = 60,000\n\n9000*3 = 27,000\n\n500*3 = 1,500\n\n24*3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYep, that's correct.\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same result, which makes me confident that the answer is indeed 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards.

It seems like a recursive structure, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier to handle.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nI count nine sets of parentheses here. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), and moving outwards. Let me assign each layer a number from 1 to 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, looking again, each layer is 3*(previous layer). Hmm, actually, let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with the innermost parenthesis:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no, looking at the structure, it's actually 3*(1 + ...). Wait, maybe I need to correct my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + the next layer). Let me try to parse this correctly.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) + 1? Wait, no. Wait, actually, looking at the structure, each layer is 3*(1 + the next layer). So, starting from Layer 1, which is (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me try to parse it correctly. Let me take the innermost expression first.\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3) at Layer 1. Then, moving out one layer, it's 3*(1 + Layer 1). So, Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, but let me check that. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). So, each layer is 3*(1 + the result of the inner layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nThen, the next layer out is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it as each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, let me compute each step:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm numbering the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count the number of 3s and parentheses.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the left, each 3 is followed by a (1 + ...). So, let's see:\n\nThe innermost is (1 + 3). Then each step out adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9, as each (1 + 3) is enclosed in another 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer 9, I got 36084. Let me verify that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in one of the layers. Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, the final result would be 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure I'm not missing anything. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, my approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me compute the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did before. So, the 9th term is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this recurrence relation. Let's see.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 3/2 = 3A - 3/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify this: (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = 11*3^{n}/6.\n\nAlternatively, 11*3^{n}/6 = (11/2)*3^{n-1}.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to leave it as is.\n\nSo, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\n11 * 19683 = Let's compute that:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nSo, total is 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nThen, divide by 6: 216,513 \u00f7 6.\n\n6*36,000 = 216,000, so 216,513 - 216,000 = 513.\n\n513 \u00f7 6 = 85.5\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 85.5 = 36,085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5.\n\n36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36,084, which matches the step-by-step computation earlier.\n\nTherefore, the result is 36,084.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in the formula approach.\n\nSo, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nAt n=9:\n\n(11/6)*3^9 = (11/6)*19683 = (11*19683)/6.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, 11*19683=216,513.\n\n216,513 \u00f7 6 = 36,085.5.\n\nThen, subtract 3/2: 36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see a pattern in the numbers I got:\n\na1=4, a2=15, a3=48, a4=147, a5=444, a6=1335, a7=4008, a8=12027, a9=36084.\n\nEach term is 3 times the previous term plus 3, which aligns with the recurrence.\n\nWait, another way to think about this is that each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, if I think of it as a geometric series, but with an additive constant each time.\n\nBut regardless, the step-by-step computation and the closed-form solution both give me 36,084, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1.

Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108,255.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each step, but since it's only 9 layers, step-by-step is manageable.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps this is a geometric series or follows a pattern.\n\nLooking at the f(n) values:\n\nf(1) = 4 = (3^1) + 1\n\nf(2) = 15 = (3^2) + 6\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to fit. Let me see:\n\nWait, f(1) = 4 = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nHmm, 147 is 3^4 + something? 3^4 is 81, so 81*1.8... Not quite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 3.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nf(1) = 4.\n\nf(2) = 3*4 + 3 = 15. Correct.\n\nf(3) = 3*15 + 3 = 48. Correct.\n\nf(4) = 3*48 + 3 = 147. Correct.\n\nf(5) = 3*147 + 3 = 444. Correct.\n\nYes, so the recurrence is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 3, with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nf(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 3.\n\nAssume f(n) = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, f(n-1) = A*3^{n-1} + B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 3.\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 3 = A*3^n + 3B + 3.\n\nSo, LHS: A*3^n + B.\n\nRHS: A*3^n + 3B + 3.\n\nSet equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 3.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 3.\n\nSimplify:\n\nB - 3B = 3 \u2192 -2B = 3 \u2192 B = -3/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition f(1) = 4.\n\nf(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 3/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 \u2192 A = 11/(2*3) = 11/6.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nf(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n})/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2.\n\nAlternatively, factoring 1/2:\n\nf(n) = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me check if this works with n=1:\n\nf(1) = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\nf(2) = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\nf(3) = (11*9 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4:\n\nf(4) = (11*27 - 3)/2 = (297 - 3)/2 = 294/2 = 147. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nNow, for n=9:\n\nf(9) = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561.\n\nSo, f(9) = (11*6561 - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 11*6561:\n\n6561 * 10 = 65,610.\n\n6561 * 1 = 6,561.\n\nSo, 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171.\n\nThen, subtract 3: 72,171 - 3 = 72,168.\n\nDivide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084.\n\nSo, f(9) = 36,084. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + f(9)) = 3*(1 + 36,084) = 3*36,085.\n\nCompute 36,085 * 3:\n\n36,000 * 3 = 108,000.\n\n85 * 3 = 255.\n\nSo, 108,000 + 255 = 108,255.\n\nThus, the final result is 108,255.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miscount the number of times to apply the formula.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) \u2192 1 layer.\n\nThen, 3*(1 + (1 + 3)) \u2192 2 layers.\n\nContinuing, each additional 3*(1 + ...) adds a layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*:\n\n1. (1 + 3) \u2192 1\n\n2. 3*(1 + ... ) \u2192 2\n\n3. 3*(1 + ... ) \u2192 3\n\n...\n\nContinuing until the 9th layer. So, yes, 9 layers, which means f(9) as computed.\n\nTherefore, the total expression is 3*(1 + f(9)) = 3*36,085 = 108,255.\n\nI think that's correct. To be thorough, I'll recompute each step once more:\n\nf(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108,255.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the closed-form formula:\n\nf(n) = (11*3^{n} - 3)/2, but wait, earlier I had f(n) = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\nf(1) = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\n(11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nSo, for n=9:\n\n(11*3^{8} - 3)/2 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72,171 - 3)/2 = 72,168/2 = 36,084.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36,084) = 3*36,085 = 108,255.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough to be confident that the answer is 108,255.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nWe start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward, recognizing a recursive pattern where each layer is of the form $3 \\times (1 + \\text{previous layer})$.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Level 1):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Level 2:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Level 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Level 4:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n\n5. **Level 5:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n\n6. **Level 6:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n\n7. **Level 7:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n\n8. **Level 8:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n\n9. **Level 9:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\nFinally, the entire expression is:\n\\[\n3 \\times (1 + 36084) = 3 \\times 36085 = 108255\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{108255}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested series of additions and multiplications by 3. It seems like each part is similar, so maybe I can solve it from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 = 12. Then, add 1 to that: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, each step involves computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, maybe I can work my way out step by step, computing each layer one by one.\n\nLet me try to outline each layer:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the outermost layer: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems quite large. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting again, maybe writing each layer more carefully:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then, subtract 476 * 3 = 1,428. So, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but 29,524 is 29,524, so 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought 3*29,524 is 88,572, which is correct. So, the final answer would be 88,572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the number of layers. The problem is written as:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3*(...), and inside that, there's 1 + 3*(...), and so on. Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me see:\n\nEach time, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 1 + 3*(1)\n3. 1 + 3*(2)\n4. 1 + 3*(3)\n5. 1 + 3*(4)\n6. 1 + 3*(5)\n7. 1 + 3*(6)\n8. 1 + 3*(7)\n9. 1 + 3*(8)\n10. 1 + 3*(9)\n\nWait, but the original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of closing parentheses after the innermost (1+3). It's 9 closing parentheses, so that would mean 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...). Wait, no, maybe it's 8 layers inside because the first 3 is multiplied by a 1+3*(...), which itself has 8 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent each step more clearly. Let me try to represent each layer step by step, maybe using variables.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1 = (1 + 3) = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 88,572. But let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, 3*29524: Let me compute this again.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses inside the outermost 3*(...). So, each layer after the outermost 3* is one more layer. So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers, so L1 to L9, each built upon the previous. So, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and its solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the initial condition: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + B => 3A + B = 4.\n\nNow, let's compute L_2 using the recurrence: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nUsing the general solution: L_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13.\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1) 3A + B = 4\n\n2) 9A + B = 13\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4\n\n6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2.\n\nNow, substitute A into equation 1:\n\n3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have L_9, because starting from L1 to L9, each layer is built upon the previous. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with both methods: step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute L_9 using the formula and then multiply by 3.\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n24 * 3 = 72\n\nAdd them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 72 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula lead me to the same answer. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Move to the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested set of terms, each starting with 1 plus 3 times something. It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe I can work from the innermost part outwards. That usually works with nested expressions because each step depends on the one inside it.\n\nLet me try to write down the expression more clearly, maybe starting from the innermost parentheses. The innermost part is (1+3). So let's compute that first.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another 1 plus 3 times that result. So the next layer is (1 + 3*(result from above)). Let me compute that.\n\n2. Next layer:\n   (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that right. So, the next layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result, which was 4. So 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, it's again 1 plus 3 times the previous result, which is 13. Let me compute that.\n\n3. Next layer:\n   (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That looks good.\n\nContinuing outward, the next layer is 1 plus 3 times 40. Let me calculate that.\n\n4. Next layer:\n   (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems a bit big, but okay.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 plus 3 times 121. Let me do that.\n\n5. Next layer:\n   (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. That's correct.\n\nNext layer again, it's 1 plus 3 times 364. Let me compute that.\n\n6. Next layer:\n   (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Okay, moving on.\n\nNext layer, 1 plus 3 times 1093. Let me calculate that.\n\n7. Next layer:\n   (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. That's a big number, but so far so good.\n\nMoving out another layer, it's 1 plus 3 times 3280. Let's do that.\n\n8. Next layer:\n   (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That seems correct.\n\nNow, going out another layer, it's 1 plus 3 times 9841. Let me compute that.\n\n9. Next layer:\n   (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, 3*9841. Let me check that multiplication. 9841 times 3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000+2400=29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then plus 1 is 29524. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer, it's 3 times the previous result. Wait, no, the entire expression is 3 times the sum, which is (1 + 3*(...)). So after computing all the inner layers, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by that last result, which is 29524.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the nested expression we just computed up to 29524. So the final step is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n10. Final step:\n    3 * 29524\n\nHmm, let me do that multiplication carefully. 29524 * 3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n- 20000 * 3 = 60000\n- 9000 * 3 = 27000\n- 500 * 3 = 1500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that can't be right because 29524*3. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute 29524*3 digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)=4\n2. (1+3*4)=13\n3. (1+3*13)=40\n4. (1+3*40)=121\n5. (1+3*121)=364\n6. (1+3*364)=1093\n7. (1+3*1093)=3280\n8. (1+3*3280)=9841\n9. (1+3*9841)=29524\n10. 3*29524=88572\n\nWait, but when I count the steps, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me check how many times the pattern repeats.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: It's 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, each layer is another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs.\n\nLet me see: Each opening parenthesis adds another layer. The original expression has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. Wait, let me count the number of 1+3 terms.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of layers.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each layer is a 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n... and so on.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3. Let me count the number of layers.\n\nEach time you have a 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nLooking at the original expression, the innermost is (1+3). Then each layer out adds another (1+3(...)). Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3) \u2192 1 layer\n- Then each time you go out, you add another layer, so total layers would be 9, since the expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)).\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had 9 layers leading to 29524, and then the outermost 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me check: the original expression is 3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3*(1+3))))))))) So the innermost is (1+3), then each step adds another (1+3*(...)), and the outermost is 3*(...).\n\nSo the number of layers is 9, each being 1+3*(previous layer). So that would mean 9 layers, each computed as 1 + 3*(result from previous layer). Then, after computing all 9 layers, the outermost operation is 3*(result of the 9th layer).\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I had 9 layers leading up to 29524, and then the 10th step was 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again: when I computed step 1, that was (1+3)=4.\n\nThen step 2: (1+3*4)=13\n\nStep 3: (1+3*13)=40\n\nStep 4: (1+3*40)=121\n\nStep 5: (1+3*121)=364\n\nStep 6: (1+3*364)=1093\n\nStep 7: (1+3*1093)=3280\n\nStep 8: (1+3*3280)=9841\n\nStep 9: (1+3*9841)=29524\n\nThen step 10: 3*29524=88572\n\nSo that's 9 layers inside, each being 1+3*(previous), and then the outermost 3 times that.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in any of the calculations.\n\nLet me verify each step again:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 \u2192 Correct.\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2192 Correct.\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2192 Correct.\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2192 Correct.\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2192 Correct.\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2192 Correct.\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2192 Correct.\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2192 Correct.\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2192 Correct.\n\n10. 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSo each step checks out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it using a different approach or check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous). Let's denote each layer as a sequence.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent with my earlier calculations. So, the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)}\\). By iteratively computing each layer, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Parentheses:**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Next Layer:**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3 \\times 9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Outermost Layer:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple layers of nested parentheses. Each layer seems to be of the form 1 + 3 times something. So maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see if I can spot a pattern or something. The innermost part is 1+3, right? Then the next layer is 1 + 3 times that result, and so on. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me see: starting from the innermost, 1+3, then 1+3(...), and so on. How many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression: the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. There's one after each 3, so let's see: starting from the left, the first part is 3(1 + ...). Then inside that, another 3(1 + ...). Hmm, maybe I should count the number of times 3 is multiplied by a parenthesis.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to start from the innermost and compute each layer step by step. Let's do that.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute 3*4 first, which is 12, then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). So 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4). So 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5). So 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is... let me compute that: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093.\n\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6). So 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280.\n\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7). So 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841.\n\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8). So 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524.\n\n10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9). So 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572.\n\nWait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check step 10 because that's the final step. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute it another way to verify. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n- 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n- 0*3=0, write down 0.\n- 0*3=0, write down 0.\n\nWait, that might not be the right way. Maybe I should compute it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, no carry.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, no carry.\nThe next digits are 0s beyond that, so we're done.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Okay, that matches my previous calculation. So step 10 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check step 9 again because I might have made a mistake there. Step 9 was 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841 again:\n\n9841 \u00d7 3:\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2\nBut wait, 9841 is a 4-digit number, so when I multiply by 3:\n\n9841\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carry over 2\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, write down 9, carry over 2\nNow, since there are no more digits, we write down the carry over 2.\n\nWait, that would make it 29523. Then step 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm step 8: 1 + 3*9841. Wait, no, step 8 was 1 + 3*(result from step 7). Step 7 was 3280, so 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nSo step 8: 9841, step 9: 29524, step 10: 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check step 7 again to make sure. Step 7 was 1 + 3*(result from step 6). Step 6 was 1093, so 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(result from step 5). Step 5 was 364, so 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(result from step 4). Step 4 was 121, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). Step 3 was 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). Step 2 was 13, so 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct.\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(result from step 1). Step 1 was 4, so 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Correct.\n\nStep 1: Innermost was 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo each step seems correct, so the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the number seems quite large, and sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the number of steps. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3=4\n2. 1+3*4=13\n3. 1+3*13=40\n4. 1+3*40=121\n5. 1+3*121=364\n6. 1+3*364=1093\n7. 1+3*1093=3280\n8. 1+3*3280=9841\n9. 1+3*9841=29524\n10. 3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that's 10 layers, which makes sense because each opening parenthesis adds a layer, and the expression has 9 opening parentheses inside the initial 3(...). Wait, let me check the original expression again.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after each 3: Let's see, starting from the innermost, each 1+3(...) is a layer. So the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) parts.\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost. So how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the initial 3(...). Let's see:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after a 3 adds a layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nLooking at the expression, the number of opening parentheses after each 3 is as follows:\n\n- The first layer after the initial 3 is 1+3(...), which has one opening parenthesis.\n- Then each subsequent layer adds another opening parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times 1+3 appears as a separate term. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) terms.\n\nInnermost: 1+3\nThen next: 1+3(1+3)\nThen next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, we add another layer. So how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen layer 2 is 1+3(layer1)\nLayer 3 is 1+3(layer2)\n...\nUp to layer 9, because the outermost is 3(1+3(...)), which is layer9.\n\nWait, no, because the initial 3 is multiplied by the first 1+3(...), which is layer1. So the total number of layers is 9, because the expression is 3*(layer9). So perhaps I overcounted earlier.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 layers inside.\n\nWait, so when I started counting from 1 to 10, I included the initial 3 as step 10, but actually, the initial 3 is the multiplier outside the first layer.\n\nSo perhaps the correct number of layers is 9, and step 10 is the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, that might mean I made a mistake in counting the steps.\n\nWait, let's recount.\n\nLet me parse the expression correctly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but according to the expression, the initial 3 is only multiplying the first layer, which is 1 + 3*(...). So the number of layers inside is 9, each adding another 1+3*(...). So the innermost is layer1, and the outermost before the initial 3 is layer9.\n\nSo when I compute step 1 to step 9, I get up to 29524, and then step 10 is multiplying by 3, giving 88572.\n\nWait, but the expression has 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:\n\nStarting from the innermost, each 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, except the last one. So how many opening parentheses are there?\n\nLet me write the expression with numbers:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo the number of opening parentheses after each 3 is 9. So that means there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So when I compute up to step 9, I get 29524, and then step 10 is the initial 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nBut wait, when I count the layers, each layer corresponds to one step. So if there are 9 layers inside, then the computation from step 1 to step 9 gives me the value inside the initial 3(...), which is 29524. Then step 10 is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial 3 is step 1, but that might complicate things. No, I think the way I did it before is correct: starting from the innermost, compute each layer step by step, and the final step is multiplying by 3.\n\nBut to make sure, let me try a smaller version of the problem to see if my approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this manually.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nAlternatively, using my step-by-step approach:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 3*40 = 120\n\nSo with 3 layers inside, I have 4 steps. Wait, that's 3 layers inside, but 4 steps. Hmm, perhaps the number of steps is equal to the number of layers plus one? Or maybe not. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the small example, there are 3 layers inside the initial 3(...). So the innermost is layer1, then layer2, then layer3. Then the initial 3 is multiplied by layer3. So in my step-by-step, I had 4 steps: 1, 2, 3, and 4. So step4 is the initial 3*result.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, there are 9 layers inside, so steps 1 to 9 compute up to the value inside, and step10 is the initial 3*result. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the small example, the number of layers inside is 3, and I had 4 steps. So in the original problem, 9 layers inside would result in 10 steps, which is what I did. So that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try another small example to confirm.\n\nLet's take 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Compute this.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nUsing my step-by-step:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 3*13 = 39\n\nSo 3 layers: 1 innermost, 1 middle, and the outermost. Wait, no, in this case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), so the innermost is 1+3, then the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) =13, then the outermost is 3*13=39. So steps: 1, 2, 3. So number of layers inside is 2, steps are 3.\n\nWait, so in the small example with two layers inside, I had 3 steps. So in the original problem, with 9 layers inside, I should have 10 steps, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, I think my approach is correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try another small example. Let's say 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Compute this.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nSo that's 3 layers inside, and steps 1 to 4. So 3 layers inside, 4 steps.\n\nThus, in the original problem, 9 layers inside, 10 steps, which gives 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each step involves multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is obtained by multiplying the last inner result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n10. Outermost layer: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{88572}$."

It seems like a recursive structure, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute the innermost (1 + 3):\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n2. The next layer is 3*(result from step 1) + 1. Wait, no, let me check. The structure is 3*(1 + ...). So actually, it's 3*(1 + something). So, the next layer out is 3*(1 + previous result). Hmm, maybe I should represent each step as a separate computation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me number the layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, layer 1 is the innermost, and layer 9 is the outermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous value). So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but let me check. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each time starting with 3*(1 + ...). So, if I have 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1 inside, the final result should be 36084.\n\nBut let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Let me compute 1336 * 3: 1300*3=3900, 36*3=108, so total 3900+108=4008. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let me compute 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so total 12000+27=12027. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute that. 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so total 36000+84=36084. Correct.\n\nSo, each step seems to check out. Therefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is written as:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nSo, counting the number of 3(...) parts, it's 9, right? Each time starting with 3*(1 + ...). So, 9 layers. So, Layer 9 is the outermost, which we computed as 36084.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), where a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence as:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 3\n\n-2*C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) = 3A - 3/2\n\nSo,\n\n3A - 3/2 = 4\n\n3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2\n\nA = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can factor out 3/2:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - (9/6) = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nCompute a_9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nTotal = 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (216,513 - 9)/6 = 216,504 / 6\n\nDivide 216,504 by 6:\n\n6*36,000 = 216,000\n\n216,504 - 216,000 = 504\n\n504 / 6 = 84\n\nSo total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches our earlier step-by-step computation. So, the answer is indeed 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me check: when I used the recursive approach, I had Layer 1 as (1+3)=4, which is a_1=4, and then each subsequent layer up to Layer 9. So, in the formula, n=9 corresponds to the outermost layer, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nI think that's solid. Both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed step by step. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence allows us to derive a closed-form formula, confirming the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 3*(1 + previous term). There are 9 such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n   - Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n   - Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n   - Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n   - Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n   - Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n   - Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n   - Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n   - Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n3. **Alternative Verification Using Recurrence Relation:**\n   - The recurrence is a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n   - Solving the recurrence gives a closed-form: a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6.\n   - For n=9, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = 36084.\n\n**Answer:** The value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}."

Let me see, starting from the inside, each time it's 1 plus 3 times another expression. I think there are nine layers here because each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, and I can count nine sets of (1+3... So maybe I need to compute this from the innermost 1+3 up to the outermost one.\n\nWait, let me check. Let's count the number of times 3 is used inside the parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then that's multiplied by 3 and added 1: 1 + 3*(result of step 1)\n3. Then that's multiplied by 3 and added 1 again, and so on.\n\nSo, there are nine layers of this. That means I need to compute this expression nine times, each time substituting the inner result into the outer expression.\n\nLet me try to compute this step by step. I'll start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out.\n\nLet's define each step as S1, S2, up to S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost.\n\nStarting with S1:\n\nS1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen S2: 1 + 3*(S1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me check. If S1 is 4, then S2 would be 1 + 3*(S1), which is 1 + 3*4 = 13. That seems correct.\n\nMoving on to S3: 1 + 3*(S2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4: 1 + 3*(S3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5: 1 + 3*(S4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6: 1 + 3*(S5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7: 1 + 3*(S6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8: 1 + 3*(S7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9: 1 + 3*(S8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3*(all that). So after computing S9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So the outermost operation is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So after computing the innermost parentheses, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So when I get to S9, that's the value inside the outermost parentheses, so I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but in my steps above, S9 was 29524, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses, so the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo 29524*3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 7\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover 1\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but in my earlier steps, I thought S9 was 29524, so 3\u00d729524 is 88572.

Let's count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then 1 + 3*(...)\n4. Continuing outward, each time adding another layer.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each time, except the innermost, it's 1 + 3*(...). So the innermost is (1 + 3), which is S1=4.\n\nThen each subsequent S2 to S9 is 1 + 3*(previous S). So yes, nine layers, so S9 is the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is then multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using a formula for such recursive expressions.\n\nI remember that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using a geometric series or a formula. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nIn this case, each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). So it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}.\n\nIf I have n layers, then S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it step by step.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: S_n - 3*S_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, no, the equation is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}.\n\nSo the homogeneous part is S_n - 3*S_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution S_n = A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution S_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is S_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition S_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, S_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo for n=9, S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo S_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. So S_9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have recognized that the expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, so using the formula S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for the innermost part, then multiplying by 3.\n\nBut in any case, whether I compute step by step or use the formula, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute S_9 using the formula and then multiply by 3.\n\nS_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with eight layers. But since I've already computed S_9 as the innermost part, I think my approach is correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each step \\( S_i \\) where \\( S_1 \\) is the innermost and \\( S_9 \\) is the outermost.\n\n1. \\( S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( S_2 = 1 + 3 \\times S_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n3. \\( S_3 = 1 + 3 \\times S_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n4. \\( S_4 = 1 + 3 \\times S_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n5. \\( S_5 = 1 + 3 \\times S_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n6. \\( S_6 = 1 + 3 \\times S_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n7. \\( S_7 = 1 + 3 \\times S_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n8. \\( S_8 = 1 + 3 \\times S_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n9. \\( S_9 = 1 + 3 \\times S_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe outermost expression is \\( 3 \\times S_9 \\):\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive kind of structure, where each layer depends on the one inside it. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier to handle. That usually works with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses, I see there are nine of them, so the innermost part is $1 + 3$. Let me start there.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute $1 + 3$:\n   - That's straightforward. $1 + 3 = 4$.\n\n2. Now, moving one layer out, we have $1 + 3(\\text{result from step 1})$:\n   - So, it's $1 + 3(4)$.\n   - Compute $3(4) = 12$.\n   - Then add 1: $1 + 12 = 13$.\n\n3. Next layer out is $1 + 3(\\text{result from step 2})$:\n   - So, $1 + 3(13)$.\n   - Compute $3(13) = 39$.\n   - Then add 1: $1 + 39 = 40$.\n\n4. Next layer: $1 + 3(\\text{result from step 3})$:\n   - $1 + 3(40)$.\n   - $3(40) = 120$.\n   - $1 + 120 = 121$.\n\n5. Continuing outward: $1 + 3(\\text{result from step 4})$:\n   - $1 + 3(121)$.\n   - $3(121) = 363$.\n   - $1 + 363 = 364$.\n\n6. Next layer: $1 + 3(\\text{result from step 5})$:\n   - $1 + 3(364)$.\n   - $3(364) = 1092$.\n   - $1 + 1092 = 1093$.\n\n7. Moving out another layer: $1 + 3(\\text{result from step 6})$:\n   - $1 + 3(1093)$.\n   - $3(1093) = 3279$.\n   - $1 + 3279 = 3280$.\n\n8. Next layer: $1 + 3(\\text{result from step 7})$:\n   - $1 + 3(3280)$.\n   - $3(3280) = 9840$.\n   - $1 + 9840 = 9841$.\n\n9. Finally, the outermost layer: $1 + 3(\\text{result from step 8})$:\n   - $1 + 3(9841)$.\n   - $3(9841) = 29523$.\n   - $1 + 29523 = 29524$.\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is multiplied by 3 at the very beginning. So, after computing the entire inner part, which gives us 29524, we need to multiply that by 3 as well. Let me make sure I didn't miss that.\n\nLooking back at the original problem: $3(1 + 3(...))$. So yes, the entire result of the inner expression is multiplied by 3. So, the final step is to compute $3 \\times 29524$.\n\n10. Compute $3 \\times 29524$:\n    - Let's calculate that. 29524 multiplied by 3.\n    - 29524 \u00d7 3:\n      - 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n      - 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n      - 5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n      - 9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n      - 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n      - There are no more digits, so we're done.\n      - So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication to be sure. It's easy to make a mistake with large numbers.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n- 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n- 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n- 20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, hold on, let me double-check each step because sometimes when you go through so many layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the intermediate steps, which would throw off the entire result.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n2. 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n3. 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n4. 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n5. 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n6. 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n7. 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n8. 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n9. 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n10. 3\u00d729524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nOkay, each step seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula that could simplify the calculation. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking at the structure, each time we have 1 + 3 times the next layer. Let me denote each layer as a term in a sequence.\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built as follows:\n- Let a\u2081 = 1 + 3\n- Then, a\u2082 = 1 + 3a\u2081\n- a\u2083 = 1 + 3a\u2082\n- And so on, up to a\u2089, since there are nine layers.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of layers again. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is a\u2081 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, actually, there are nine layers, so a\u2089 would be the innermost, and we go up to a\u2080, which is the outermost.\n\nWait, maybe I should index them differently. Let me think.\n\nActually, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, let's say a\u2089 = 1 + 3, then a\u2088 = 1 + 3a\u2089, and so on, until a\u2080 = 3a\u2081, where a\u2081 is the result of the innermost expression.\n\nWait, no, actually, the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, perhaps it's better to index from the inside out.\n\nLet me try this:\n\nLet\u2019s define each nested expression as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote E\u2099 as the expression starting from the nth layer.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nE\u2081 = 1 + 3\n\nE\u2082 = 1 + 3E\u2081\n\nE\u2083 = 1 + 3E\u2082\n\n...\n\nE\u2089 = 1 + 3E\u2088\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3E\u2089.\n\nSo, with E\u2081 through E\u2089 defined as above, we can compute each E\u1d62 step by step.\n\nSo, E\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE\u2082 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n\nE\u2083 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n\nE\u2084 = 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n\nE\u2085 = 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n\nE\u2086 = 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n\nE\u2087 = 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n\nE\u2088 = 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n\nE\u2089 = 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d7E\u2089 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nSo, same result as before. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for E\u2099 in terms of n. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nE\u2081 = 4\n\nE\u2082 = 13\n\nE\u2083 = 40\n\nE\u2084 = 121\n\nE\u2085 = 364\n\nE\u2086 = 1093\n\nE\u2087 = 3280\n\nE\u2088 = 9841\n\nE\u2089 = 29524\n\nI can try to see if each E\u2099 relates to a geometric progression or something similar.\n\nLooking at E\u2081 = 4\n\nE\u2082 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n\nE\u2083 = 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n\nE\u2084 = 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n\nHmm, each E\u2099 = 1 + 3E\u2099\u208b\u2081\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for E\u2099.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is E\u2099 = aE\u2099\u208b\u2081 + b, where a = 3 and b = 1 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is E\u2099 = C\u00d7a\u207f + d, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions, and d is the particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the particular solution. Assume E\u2099 = d. Then, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nd = 3d + 1\n\nSolving for d:\n\nd - 3d = 1\n\n-2d = 1\n\nd = -1/2\n\nHmm, so the particular solution is E\u2099 = -1/2.\n\nThen, the general solution is E\u2099 = C\u00d73\u207f - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n = 1, E\u2081 = 4.\n\nSo, E\u2081 = C\u00d73\u00b9 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is E\u2099 = (3/2)\u00d73\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nE\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n = 1, E\u2081 = (3\u00b2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n = 2, E\u2082 = (3\u00b3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which also matches.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each E\u2099, we can compute it as (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3\u00b9\u2070:\n\n3\u00b9 = 3\n\n3\u00b2 = 9\n\n3\u00b3 = 27\n\n3\u2074 = 81\n\n3\u2075 = 243\n\n3\u2076 = 729\n\n3\u2077 = 2187\n\n3\u2078 = 6561\n\n3\u2079 = 19683\n\n3\u00b9\u2070 = 59049\n\nTherefore, E\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier calculation. So, E\u2089 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d7E\u2089 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572\n\nSo, using both iterative step-by-step computation and a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series.\n\nEach time, we have E\u2099 = 1 + 3E\u2099\u208b\u2081, which can be expanded as:\n\nE\u2099 = 1 + 3(1 + 3E\u2099\u208b\u2082) = 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2E\u2099\u208b\u2082\n\nContinuing this way, after n steps, we get:\n\nE\u2099 = 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2 + 3\u00b3 + ... + 3\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + 3\u207fE\u2080\n\nBut in our case, E\u2080 is 1, since we start with E\u2081 = 1 + 3. Wait, maybe not exactly, let me think.\n\nActually, if we unroll the recurrence all the way, for E\u2099, we get:\n\nE\u2099 = 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... + 3(1))...))\n\nWhich is a finite geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1 and having n terms, but each term is multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, actually, the sum inside would be 1 + 3 + 3\u00b2 + ... + 3\u207f\u207b\u00b9, but multiplied by 3 each time.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as E\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2, which we already have.\n\nSo, given that, since we have E\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2, and the entire expression is 3\u00d7E\u2089, which is 3\u00d7(59049 - 1)/2 = 3\u00d759048/2 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after computing step by step, verifying through a recurrence relation, and even attempting a different approach with geometric series and closed-form expressions, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \\]\n\n2. Move one layer out:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \\]\n\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\]\n\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[ 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

So, maybe I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me try to parse it step by step.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Layer 9, since there are 9 layers after the initial 3.\n\nWait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...), and each of those is multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 occurs.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 instances of \"1 + 3(...)\" nested inside. So, there are 9 layers to compute, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let me compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet's define L1, L2, ..., L9, where each L represents the value of that layer.\n\nStarting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4\n\nCompute that: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute that: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40\n\nCompute that: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121\n\nCompute that: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364\n\nCompute that: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute that: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute that: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute that: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9), because the outermost layer is 3*(...), where ... is the entire nested part.\n\nSo, compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\nThen, 500 * 3 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\nThen, 24 * 3 = 72, so 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572.\n\nSo, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing L1 to L9.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it in a more general way to confirm.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P\n\nSolving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 4\n\nThus, 3C - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nTherefore, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I checked each layer step by step, and then also used a general formula for the recurrence relation to confirm. Both methods gave the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost layer and work our way out. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like a recursive or iterative process. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards, it'll be easier to handle.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is $1 + 3$. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: $1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have another 1 plus 3 times the result we just got. Wait, no, actually, each level is 1 plus 3 times the next level. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote each level as Level 1 to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost.\n\nLevel 1: $1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nLevel 2: $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{Level 1}) = 1 + 3 \\times 4$.\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I should number them from the inside out. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, starting from the left, I see nine opening parentheses, so there are nine levels. Let me confirm:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nYes, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times another expression, and this repeats nine times. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth level, and working our way up to the first level.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let's define each level as follows:\n\nLevel 1: $1 + 3$\n\nLevel 2: $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{Level 1})$\n\nLevel 3: $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{Level 2})$\n\nAnd so on, up to Level 9, which is the outermost expression before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, but looking at the original expression, the outermost is 3 times (something). So, actually, Level 9 is the innermost, and the outermost is 3 times Level 9.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to reverse the numbering. Let me try again.\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\nInnermost: $1 + 3 = 4$ (this is the first innermost part, let's call this Level 1).\n\nThen, moving out one level: $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{Level 1}) = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13$ (Level 2).\n\nNext level out: $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{Level 2}) = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40$ (Level 3).\n\nContinuing this way, each time taking the previous level's result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and moving up a level.\n\nSo, let me tabulate this step by step.\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3 * 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3 * 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3 * 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3 * 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3 * 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3 * 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3 * 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3 * 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, but the original expression has nine levels of parentheses, right? Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)) parts.\n\nStarting from the first 3(1+3(...)), each time it's another 3(1+3(...)). Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. 3(1+3(...))\n3. 3(1+3(...))\n4. 3(1+3(...))\n5. 3(1+3(...))\n6. 3(1+3(...))\n7. 3(1+3(...))\n8. 3(1+3(...))\n9. 3(1+3(...))\n\nYes, nine levels. So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth level, and moving outwards.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Level 9, which resulted in 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that Level 9 result.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me clarify. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is the last (1 + 3), which is Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out, Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is 3 times (Level 9). So, the total expression is 3 * 29524.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had Level 9 as 29524, which is 1 + 3*(Level 8). So, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, 3*29524.\n\nBut let me confirm: the original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested parentheses. So, yes, after computing the innermost to the outermost, which is Level 9 as 29524, then the total is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had Level 1 to Level 9, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous level). So, Level 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the original problem, is the outermost 3 multiplying the entire nested expression, which is Level 9? Yes.\n\nSo, the total value is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the total value is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels. Let me recount the levels:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nThis looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think.\n\nEach level is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let's test this formula with our earlier calculations.\n\nFor Level 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: n=4, a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: n=5, a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: n=6, a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: n=7, a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: n=8, a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Level n is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Level 9 is a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the entire expression as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, to recap, by breaking down the nested expression step by step, computing each level from the innermost outwards, and then applying the final multiplication by 3, I arrived at the result of 88,572. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation formula, I confirmed that the result is indeed 88,572.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with each level, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each level is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous level. By calculating each level step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost value is 4. Each subsequent level is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine levels, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth level. Using the formula for the nth level, we find the ninth level equals 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each layer seems to follow the pattern of 3 times (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part and working my way out might be the best approach. That way, I can compute each layer step by step without getting confused.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 3 times (1 plus the result of the previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost, I can compute each one sequentially.\n\nLet's define L1 as the innermost expression: L1 = 1 + 3. Then, L2 would be 3*(1 + L1), L3 would be 3*(1 + L2), and so on, until I reach the outermost layer, which is 3*(1 + L8). Wait, let me count how many layers there are.

So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result).\n\nSo, let's start computing:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nWait, but let me check: the original expression has 8 layers of 3*(1+...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied: starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, starting from (1+3), that's layer 1, then each 3*(1 + ...) adds a layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of closing parentheses after the first 3. Each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the first innermost, then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so the total number of layers is 8, because after the first 3, there are 8 sets of parentheses. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(...)), which is 8 layers deep. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous), so we have 8 layers. So, layer 1 is (1+3)=4, layer 2 is 3*(1+4)=15, layer3=3*(1+15)=48, layer4=3*(1+48)=147, layer5=3*(1+147)=444, layer6=3*(1+444)=1335, layer7=3*(1+1335)=4008, layer8=3*(1+4008)=12027.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the first 3, there are 8 layers, so the total expression is 3*(1 + layer8). Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so the outermost is 3*(1 + layer7), because layer8 would be the innermost. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression correctly. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the number of layers is 8, because after the first 3, there are 8 sets of parentheses.\n\nSo, let me list them:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + Layer8). So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer8). Wait, no, because Layer8 is the innermost. Wait, no, let me see.\n\nWait, no, actually, Layer1 is the innermost, and Layer8 is the outermost. So, the entire expression is Layer8, which is 12027. Wait, no, because the outermost is 3*(1 + Layer7), which is 3*(1 + 4008)=12027. So, the entire expression is 12027.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3)=4.\n\nThen, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, the layers are:\n\nLayer1: 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4)=15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15)=48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48)=147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147)=444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444)=1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335)=4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008)=12027\n\nSo, the entire expression is Layer8, which is 12027. Therefore, the answer is 12027.\n\nWait, but let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct.\n\nYes, each step seems to be correct. So, the final result is 12027.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or look for a pattern, but since the numbers are manageable, step-by-step computation seems straightforward.\n\nWait, another approach: each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nSo, again, a_8 is 12027, which is the value of the entire expression.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12027.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and each step follows logically from the previous one. So, I'm confident that 12027 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 3 times (1 plus the previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 15\\)\n3. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 48\\)\n4. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 147\\)\n5. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 444\\)\n6. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 1335\\)\n7. Next layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 4008\\)\n8. Outermost layer: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 12027\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{12027}\\)."

    "text": " Let me try to parse this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with a 1 and then a 3 multiplied by something. It seems like each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). So maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually makes sense with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write it out step by step, starting from the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1+3), right? So let's compute that first.\n\n1 + 3 = 4.\n\nOkay, so now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result. Wait, no, let me see. The structure is 3(1 + ...). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So the innermost part is (1 + 3), which is 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4). Let me confirm that.\n\nWait, maybe I should number the layers to keep track. Let's see, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that. Wait, if each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), then each time, the value is tripling and adding 3. Hmm, maybe I can find a pattern here.\n\nBut let's just proceed step by step to be sure.\n\nSo Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count the number of 3s. Starting from the left, the first 3 is outside, then each subsequent 3 is inside. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each time we have a (1 + 3(...)). Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. The inner 3(...) is another 3(1 + 3(...))\n3. So each time we have a new layer. Let's count the number of times we have 3(1 + 3(...)).\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, there are 9 layers because each 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...)), and the innermost is (1+3). So that's 9 layers. Wait, but when I was counting earlier, I went up to Layer 9 as 36084. But maybe I made a mistake in the counting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each layer step by step, making sure I don't skip any.\n\nLet me try again, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(1 + Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = ?\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the ... goes up to Layer 9. So after computing Layer 9 as 36084, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084). So that would be 3*(36085) = ?\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me compute that.\n\n3*36085: Let's compute 36085 * 3.\n\nFirst, 36000 * 3 = 108000\n\nThen 85 * 3 = 255\n\nSo total is 108000 + 255 = 108255.\n\nWait, so is the final answer 108255? Hmm, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1+4)=15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1+15)=48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1+48)=147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1+147)=444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1+444)=1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1+1335)=4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1+4008)=12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1+12027)=36084\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me see how many layers there are in the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer. Let's count the number of 3s after the initial 3. Each 3 corresponds to a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of 3s in the expression:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. So the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the first 3, the number of layers is 9 because each time you have a 3 followed by (1+3(...)), and the innermost is (1+3). So that's 9 layers, which I computed up to Layer 9 as 36084. Then, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nWait, but let me check that the count is correct. Let's count the number of times \"3(\" appears in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a 3 followed by a (, so:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nWait, no, actually, the first 3 is the outermost, then each subsequent 3 is inside. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the next 3 is inside, so:\n\nThe expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of 3s after the first one is 8, because each time you have a 3 inside another set of parentheses. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of each layer as a step, starting from the innermost. Let me try to write the layers as L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nL3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nL4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nL5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nL6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nL7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nL8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nL9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(1 + L9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that there are 9 layers. The original expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)), right? Let me count the number of closing parentheses to see how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), which is one layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have (1+3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) in the expression:\n\n1. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2013 that's the innermost, which is 1+3(...). So each time we have a (1+3(...)), that's a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the number of \"1+3(\" is 9, because each time you have 1+3 followed by another (.\n\nWait, but the first \"1+3(\" is at the second character, then each subsequent one is inside. So, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. After the first 3, we have (1+3(...\n\n2. Then inside that, another (1+3(...)\n\n3. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nSo, from the expression, it's 3 followed by 8 more \"1+3(\" because each time you go deeper, you add another \"1+3(\".\n\nWait, but let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1+3( adds an opening parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nFirst, after the first 3, we have:\n\n(1+3(...\n\nThen inside that, another (1+3(...), and so on until the innermost (1+3).\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 8, meaning there are 8 layers inside the first 3. So, the total number of layers would be 9, including the first 3's parentheses.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think that each \"3(\" adds a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each 3 inside adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1+3(...), then inside that, another 3, and so on. Let me count the number of 3s after the first one.\n\n1. After the first 3, the next 3 is inside the first parentheses: 3(1+3(...)\n\n2. Then inside that, another 3: 3(1+3(...)\n\n3. Continuing until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many 3s are there after the first one? Let me count:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have 8 more 3s, because each time you have a 3 followed by (1+3(...). So, total layers would be 9, including the first one.\n\nWait, perhaps that's where I went wrong earlier. Maybe the number of layers is 9, so when I computed up to Layer 9 as 36084, that's the innermost, and then the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nBut let me confirm by computing each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the calculations.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085.\n\nNow, computing 3*36085:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n36085 * 3:\n\n30000 * 3 = 90000\n\n6000 * 3 = 18000\n\n80 * 3 = 240\n\n5 * 3 = 15\n\nAdding them up: 90000 + 18000 = 108000\n\n108000 + 240 = 108240\n\n108240 + 15 = 108255\n\nSo, 3*36085 = 108255.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought there were 9 layers, but now I'm thinking maybe I have 9 layers inside the first 3, so the total expression is 3*(1 + L9), which is 108255.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try a different approach. Let me write the entire expression step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNext layer out: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nNext: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer should be 108255.\n\nBut let me check with a different approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recursive relation where each term is 3 times (1 plus the previous term).\n\nSo, starting with a_1 = 4 (from the innermost layer), then:\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9, which is 36084.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recursive relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a linear recurrence. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C\n\nWhich is 11/2 = 3C => C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 - 3/2\n\nSimplify further:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6\n\nNow, for n = 9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nSo, 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nThen, 216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n216,504 / 6 = ?\n\n6 * 36,000 = 216,000\n\n216,504 - 216,000 = 504\n\n504 / 6 = 84\n\nSo, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation of Layer 9 as 36,084.\n\nThen, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36,084) = 3*36,085 = 108,255.\n\nSo, this confirms that the final answer is 108,255.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36,084) = 108,255.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 108,255.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nFinally, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255.\n\n$\\boxed{108255}$"

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with a 1 plus 3 times something. It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe there's a pattern or a way to simplify it without having to compute each part separately. Hmm, let's see.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3 times the previous expression. There are nine sets of parentheses here, so it's like a nested structure with nine levels. That's a lot, but maybe I can compute it step by step, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me define each level as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the innermost expression as Level 1, then each subsequent layer as Level 2, Level 3, and so on, up to Level 9. Then, the entire expression would be 3 times Level 9.\n\nSo, Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2)\n\nAnd so on, until Level 9.\n\nThis seems manageable. So, let's compute each level step by step.\n\nStarting with Level 1:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nAlright, Level 2 is 13.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 3 is 40.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 4 is 121.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 5 is 364.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364\n\nLet me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092.\n\nSo, Level 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 6 is 1093.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093\n\nCompute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279\n\nThus, Level 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 7 is 3280.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280\n\nCompute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 8 is 9841.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841\n\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down.\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*800 = 2400\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n3*1 = 3\n\nSo, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523\n\nThus, Level 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLevel 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9), which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n3*29524:\n\n3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000\n\n3*500 = 1500\n\n3*24 = 72\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nStarting from Level 1:\n\n1: 4\n\n2: 13\n\n3: 40\n\n4: 121\n\n5: 364\n\n6: 1093\n\n7: 3280\n\n8: 9841\n\n9: 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, seems correct. Each level is computed by multiplying the previous level by 3 and adding 1. So, each Level n is 1 + 3*(Level n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series, perhaps? Let's see.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the expression starting from Level 1 as a1 = 4\n\nThen, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by unfolding the recurrence.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard solution method is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1\n\n-2C = 1\n\nC = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. So, Level 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as above. So, the original expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIf a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and also derived a general formula which gave the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down step by step from the innermost parentheses.\n\nWe define each level as follows, starting from the innermost expression:\n\n- Level 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Level 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 1} = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Level 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 2} = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Level 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 3} = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Level 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 4} = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Level 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 5} = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Level 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 6} = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Level 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 7} = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Level 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{Level 8} = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is then \\(3 \\times \\text{Level 9}\\):\n\n- \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Each level's result is plugged into the next, and the multiplication by 3 and addition of 1 is done correctly each time. So I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without going through each level, but since it's only nine levels, step-by-step computation is manageable. But just for curiosity, let me see if I can find a pattern.\n\nLooking at the results of each level:\n\nLevel 1: 4\n\nLevel 2: 13\n\nLevel 3: 40\n\nLevel 4: 121\n\nLevel 5: 364\n\nLevel 6: 1093\n\nLevel 7: 3280\n\nLevel 8: 9841\n\nLevel 9: 29524\n\nHmm, these numbers look familiar. They seem similar to the sequence of numbers where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. Let me check:\n\nStarting from 4:\n\n4\n\n3*4 +1 =13\n\n3*13 +1=40\n\n3*40 +1=121\n\nYes, that's exactly the pattern. So each level is 3*(previous level) +1.\n\nSo, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis kind of recurrence can be solved using the formula for linear recurrences. The general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nGiven a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3*K +1\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K =1\n\n-2K=1\n\nK= -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApply initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3C\n\n9/2 = 3C\n\nC= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo for level n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check for n=1:\n\n(3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2:\n\n(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3:\n\n(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nSo, in our problem, the innermost level is level 1: a_1=4.\n\nThen each subsequent level is a_2, a_3, up to a_9.\n\nSo the outermost expression is 3*(a_9).\n\nGiven that a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572.\n\nJust to ensure there's no mistake, I can compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nYep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully working through the problem step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards.

Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Next level: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8.

    "text": " Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 times something. It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually makes sense with nested expressions, right? So, let's start by identifying the innermost part.\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost part is the last one before all the closing parentheses. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time there's a \"1+3(...)\", so let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, each time it's multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and each of those has their own (1 + 3(...)). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Then, moving outward, each layer adds another (1+3(...)), so let's see:\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should write down each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try to parse the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nSo, (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from above)).\n\nSo, let's compute each layer one by one.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., up to L9, since I see nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, let me check again. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nLayer 1 (L1): (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, Layer 2 (L2) is (1 + 3*(L1)). So, 1 + 3*4.\n\nCompute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3 (L3): (1 + 3*(L2)) = 1 + 3*13.\n\nCompute that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4 (L4): (1 + 3*(L3)) = 1 + 3*40.\n\nCompute that: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5 (L5): (1 + 3*(L4)) = 1 + 3*121.\n\nCompute that: 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6 (L6): (1 + 3*(L5)) = 1 + 3*364.\n\nCompute that: 3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7 (L7): (1 + 3*(L6)) = 1 + 3*1093.\n\nCompute that: 3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8 (L8): (1 + 3*(L7)) = 1 + 3*3280.\n\nCompute that: 3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9 (L9): (1 + 3*(L8)) = 1 + 3*9841.\n\nCompute that: 3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nNow, finally, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, 3*29524.\n\nCompute that: 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3.\n\nWait, maybe I should do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me check with another method.\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3.\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000.\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000.\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500.\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems quite a large number. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.\n\nWait, let me go back and check each layer step by step, because 88572 seems high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check L9 again. 3\u00d79841: 9841 \u00d7 3.\n\nLet me compute 9841 \u00d7 3:\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000.\n\n800 \u00d7 3 = 2400.\n\n40 \u00d7 3 = 120.\n\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3.\n\nAdding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nYes, so 3\u00d79841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524: Let's compute 29524 \u00d7 3.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3: 20000\u00d73=60000, 9000\u00d73=27000, 500\u00d73=1500, 20\u00d73=60, 4\u00d73=12.\n\nAdding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again because I might have miscounted.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the first one:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(1 + 3))\n3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer, which would be the outermost one before the final 3(...).\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to L9 as (1 + 3*(...)), which would be the ninth layer, and then multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, but let me check: the expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is (1 + 3*(L8)), and so on.\n\nWait, but let me see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, we have 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\". So, L1 to L9.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to L9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that's correct.\n\nBut let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a smaller version, say:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nNext layer: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier method, that would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Wait, no, that's not matching.\n\nWait, no, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))).\n\nWait, so innermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\nThen, (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, I thought it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39, but that's incorrect because the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the ... is (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))).\n\nWait, no, let me write it correctly.\n\nLet me parse it step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outward, we have (1 + 3*(4)) = 13.\n\nThen, moving outward, we have (1 + 3*(13)) = 40.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(40) = 120.\n\nSo, the result is 120.\n\nBut according to my initial method, if I had L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, then the total is 3*L3=120, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in my original problem, I had 9 layers, each time adding 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, in the small example, 3 layers inside the 3*(), resulting in 120.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, with 9 layers, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another small example to make sure.\n\nTake 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). As above, it's 120.\n\nAnother example: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\nInnermost: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*4)=13.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*13)=40.\n\nNext: (1 + 3*40)=121.\n\nThen, 3*121=363.\n\nSo, the result would be 363.\n\nWait, but according to my method, L1=4, L2=13, L3=40, L4=121, then 3*121=363.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, going back, in the original problem, with 9 layers, I computed up to L9=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nHmm, seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" sections.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to the ninth layer.\n\nYes, so 9 layers inside the initial 3*(...).\n\nTherefore, the computation is correct, leading to 88572.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step.\n\nL1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nL2: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nL3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nL4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nL5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nL6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nL7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nL8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nL9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can notice a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define L_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^{n}.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (L1):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer L2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer L3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer L4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer L5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer L6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer L7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer L8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer L9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It looks like a recursive structure, where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write this down step by step. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving outward, each layer adds another 1 and multiplies by 3. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time I go out, there's another 3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: (1+3)\n2. Next: (1+3(...))\n3. Then another, and so on.\n\nWait, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis. Let me count them. After the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each followed by 1+3(...). So, that means there are 9 layers of nesting. So, starting from the innermost, I need to compute each layer step by step.\n\nWait, no, actually, the first 3 is multiplied by (1+3(...)), and each subsequent layer is another (1+3(...)). So, perhaps it's 9 layers inside the first 3. Let me check:\n\nThe structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))\n\nYes, so starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step adds another layer. So, let's compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and work our way out. So, let me define the innermost as L1, then each layer above it as L2, L3, etc., up to L9, since there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...).\n\nWait, no, perhaps L1 is the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then L2 is 3*(1 + L1), then L3 is 3*(1 + L2), and so on, up to L9, which would be the outermost expression. Hmm, maybe that's a good approach.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(...), so perhaps the outermost is 3*(L9), where L9 is (1 + L8). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but wait a second, in the problem, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, Layer2 is 3*(1 + Layer1), which is 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nThen, Layer3 would be 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check: Is Layer2 3*(1 + Layer1), and Layer3 is 3*(1 + Layer2), and so on? That seems right.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so each time, it's 3*(1 + next layer). So, each Layer n is 3*(1 + Layer (n-1)), starting from Layer1 being (1 + 3).\n\nWait, but in the problem, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer above adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps I should compute each step as follows:\n\nLet me list each layer step by step.\n\nLet me define L1 as the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, L2 is 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nL3 is 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nL4 is 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nL5 is 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nL6 is 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nL7 is 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nL8 is 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nL9 is 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but the problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), so the outermost is 3*(...), where the inner part is 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps I've counted correctly up to L9 as 36084, but let me check how many layers there are.\n\nWait, in the problem, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times 3*(1 + ... appears.\n\nLooking at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, we have a new opening parenthesis. Let me count them:\n\n1. (1+3(...)\n2. (1+3(...)\n3. (1+3(...)\n4. (1+3(...)\n5. (1+3(...)\n6. (1+3(...)\n7. (1+3(...)\n8. (1+3(...)\n9. (1+3(...))\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, meaning 9 layers. So, my earlier calculation up to L9 as 36084 seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me verify each step again, because it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, according to this, the entire expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did each multiplication correctly.\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4, correct.\n\nLayer2: 3*(1+4)=3*5=15, correct.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1+15)=3*16=48, correct.\n\nLayer4: 3*(1+48)=3*49=147, correct.\n\nLayer5: 3*(1+147)=3*148=444, correct.\n\nLayer6: 3*(1+444)=3*445=1335, correct.\n\nLayer7: 3*(1+1335)=3*1336=4008, correct.\n\nLayer8: 3*(1+4008)=3*4009=12027, correct.\n\nLayer9: 3*(1+12027)=3*12028=36084, correct.\n\nHmm, so that seems consistent. Therefore, the value of the expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute this using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula.\n\nWait, looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from L1=4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + L(n-1)).\n\nSo, if I denote L(n) as 3*(1 + L(n-1)), then L(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nWait, that's a linear recurrence relation. Let me write that down:\n\nL(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nWith L(1) = 4\n\nHmm, so this is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 3\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p.\n\nAssume L_p is a constant. Then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nL_p = 3 + 3*L_p\n\nSolving for L_p:\n\nL_p - 3*L_p = 3\n\n-2*L_p = 3\n\nL_p = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL(n) = C*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L(1)=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3C - 3/2\n\nAdding 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3C\n\nWhich is 11/2 = 3C\n\nSo, C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\nL(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nAlternatively, we can factor 3^n:\n\nL(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWait, let me compute L(1) using this formula:\n\nL(1) = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute L(2):\n\nL(2) = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - (9/6) = (90/6) = 15, which matches.\n\nL(3) = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - (9/6) = (288/6) = 48, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L(9) = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683\n\nSo, L(9) = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\nFirst, 19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5\n\nThen, 3280.5 * 11 = Let's compute:\n\n3280 * 11 = 36080\n\n0.5 * 11 = 5.5\n\nSo, total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5\n\nNow, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5:\n\n36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084\n\nSo, L(9) = 36084, which matches our earlier step-by-step calculation.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute this using a different approach, maybe expanding the expression as a sum.\n\nWait, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, expanding each term, perhaps it's a geometric series.\n\nWait, considering the recurrence L(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4.\n\nThis can be rewritten as L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 3.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution we found earlier is correct, but perhaps we can also express it in terms of a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to expand L(n):\n\nL(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1)\n\n= 3 + 3*(3 + 3*L(n-2))\n\n= 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*L(n-2)\n\n= 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*L(n-2)\n\nContinuing this way, until we reach L(1):\n\n= 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*3 + 3^2*3*L(n-3)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express L(n) as:\n\nL(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1)\n\n= 3 + 3*(3 + 3*L(n-2))\n\n= 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*L(n-2)\n\n= 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*(3 + 3*L(n-3))\n\n= 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^3*L(n-3)\n\nContinuing this way, we see that L(n) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n + 3^n*L(1)\n\nWait, but L(1)=4, so L(n) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n + 3^n*4\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check with n=2:\n\nFrom earlier, L(2)=15.\n\nUsing the formula: 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*4 = 3 + 9 + 9*4 = 3 + 9 + 36 = 48, which is incorrect because L(2)=15. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the recurrence relation more carefully. Let me write out the terms:\n\nL(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nSo, L(n) = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*L(n-2)) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*L(n-2)\n\nSimilarly, L(n) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*(3 + 3*L(n-3)) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^3*L(n-3)\n\nContinuing this, until we reach L(1)=4.\n\nSo, for n layers, L(n) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n + 3^n*L(1)\n\nWait, that seems more accurate.\n\nSo, L(n) = sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k + 3^n*L(1)\n\nGiven that L(1)=4, then:\n\nL(n) = sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k + 3^n*4\n\nThe sum sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k is a geometric series with first term 3 and ratio 3, so the sum is 3*(3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 + 4*3^n\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (3^{n+1} - 3 + 8*3^n)/2\n\nBut 3^{n+1} = 3*3^n, so:\n\n= (3*3^n - 3 + 8*3^n)/2\n\n= (11*3^n - 3)/2\n\nWhich is the same as the solution we found earlier: L(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n(11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nWait, but in the previous approach, we had L(n) = (11*3^n - 3)/2\n\nWait, that doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nFrom the sum approach:\n\nsum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2\n\nThen, L(n) = sum + 4*3^n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 + 4*3^n\n\nLet me write 4*3^n as (8*3^n)/2 to have a common denominator:\n\n= (3^{n+1} - 3 + 8*3^n)/2\n\nNow, 3^{n+1} is 3*3^n, so:\n\n= (3*3^n + 8*3^n - 3)/2\n\n= (11*3^n - 3)/2\n\nSo, L(n) = (11*3^n - 3)/2\n\nWait, but earlier, using the recurrence solution, we had L(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2, which is equivalent to (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nWait, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute for n=1:\n\nUsing (11*3^1 - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15, which is incorrect because L(1)=4.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum approach.\n\nWait, no, let's see: when n=1, the sum is 3^1=3, then L(1) = sum + 4*3^1 = 3 + 4*3 = 3 + 12 = 15, but we know L(1)=4, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, that suggests that the sum approach is incorrect. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the expansion. Let me try again.\n\nFrom the recurrence, L(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nWe can write this as L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 3\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it using the method of finding homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume L_p(n) = A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 3\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 3\n\n-2A = 3\n\nA = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nApplying initial condition L(1)=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1.5\n\nAdding 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3C\n\nC = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nThus, L(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nL(n) = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2\n\nWhich is the same as (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\n(11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4, correct.\n\nFor n=2:\n\n(11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15, correct.\n\nFor n=3:\n\n(11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48, correct.\n\nSo, the correct formula is L(n) = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nWait, but earlier, using the sum approach, I got L(n) = (11*3^n - 3)/2, which is different. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum approach.\n\nWait, let's try to compute L(n) using the expansion method again.\n\nFrom the recurrence:\n\nL(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nSo, expanding:\n\nL(n) = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*L(n-2)) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*L(n-2)\n\nSimilarly, L(n) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*(3 + 3*L(n-3)) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^3*L(n-3)\n\nContinuing this, until we reach L(1):\n\nL(n) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n + 3^n*L(1)\n\nSince L(1)=4, we have:\n\nL(n) = sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k + 4*3^n\n\nNow, sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k is a geometric series with sum S = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2\n\nSo, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 + 4*3^n\n\nLet me combine these terms:\n\n= (3^{n+1} - 3 + 8*3^n)/2\n\nBut 3^{n+1} = 3*3^n, so:\n\n= (3*3^n + 8*3^n - 3)/2\n\n= (11*3^n - 3)/2\n\nWait, but this conflicts with the earlier result from the recurrence solution, which was L(n) = (11*3^n - 9)/6\n\nWait, let's compute both expressions for n=1:\n\nFrom sum approach: (11*3 - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15, which is incorrect because L(1)=4.\n\nFrom recurrence solution: (11*3 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4, correct.\n\nSo, the sum approach must be wrong. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the expansion. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the expansion, L(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1)\n\nBut L(n-1) = 3 + 3*L(n-2), so substituting:\n\nL(n) = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*L(n-2)) = 3 + 9 + 9*L(n-2)\n\nSimilarly, L(n) = 3 + 9 + 9*(3 + 3*L(n-3)) = 3 + 9 + 27 + 27*L(n-3)\n\nContinuing this way, we see that L(n) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n + 3^n*L(1)\n\nWait, but when n=1, L(1)=4, so:\n\nL(1) = 3 + 3^1*4 = 3 + 12 = 15, which is wrong because L(1)=4. So, the expansion is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the expansion only applies for n >=2, not n=1.\n\nWait, let's try n=2:\n\nFrom expansion, L(2)=3 + 3^2 + 3^2*L(1) = 3 + 9 + 9*4 = 3 + 9 + 36 = 48, but L(2)=15, which is wrong.\n\nWait, that can't be. So, perhaps the expansion approach is incorrect because I'm including L(1) in the sum, but L(1) is a base case, not part of the expansion beyond n=1.\n\nWait, maybe I should model L(n) as starting from n=0, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the sum approach isn't the right way to model this.\n\nGiven that the recurrence solution gives the correct result, and the sum approach seems to lead to inconsistencies, perhaps I should stick with the recurrence solution.\n\nTherefore, using L(n) = (11*3^n - 9)/6, we can compute L(9):\n\nCompute 3^9=19683\n\nSo, L(9) = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683*10=196830\n\n19683*1=19683\n\nSo, total is 196830 + 19683 = 216513\n\nThen, subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504\n\nDivide by 6: 216504 / 6\n\nWell, 6*36084 = 216504, so L(9)=36084, which matches our earlier calculations.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 36084.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I considered both step-by-step computation and a recurrence relation approach, checked for consistency, and arrived at the same answer both ways. So, I'm confident that 36084 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer's value and find that the entire expression evaluates to 36084.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a series of nested terms, each being 3 multiplied by (1 + next nested term).\n\n2. **Compute Innermost Layer:**\n   - Innermost term: (1 + 3) = 4\n\n3. **Compute Each Subsequent Layer:**\n   - Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n   - Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n   - Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n   - Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n   - Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n   - Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n   - Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n   - Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\n4. **Final Result:** The outermost layer evaluates to 36084.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{36084}"

So that's 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure. The expression is 3 times (1 + something). So the next level up would be 3 times (1 + the result from step 2). Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's take it step by step. Let me number each layer from the inside out.\n\nThe innermost parentheses is the 9th layer:\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nThen, moving outwards, Layer 8 is 3*(1 + Layer 9). So that's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that again. Let me write out each layer with their respective computations.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression only has 9 layers, right? Let me check how many times 3 is multiplied. Starting from the innermost, each step is a layer. So from the innermost (1+3), that's the first layer, and each subsequent multiplication by 3 adds another layer. So in total, the expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So the final result would be Layer 9, which is 36084.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Maybe I can compute each layer step by step again.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer's value again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which might save me time and reduce the chance of error.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4.\n\nLayer 2: 15.\n\nLayer 3: 48.\n\nLayer 4: 147.\n\nLayer 5: 444.\n\nLayer 6: 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 36084.\n\nWait, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous result). So each layer is 3*(1 + previous).\n\nSo, let's see if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series, but let me check.\n\nWait, if we denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, then a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}).\n\nSo, a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3 => C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nBut let's check if this works for n=1:\n\na_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - (3/2) = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nNow, let's compute a_9 using this formula.\n\na_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2.\n\nCompute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.\n\nSo, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2.\n\nCompute (11/6)*19683:\n\n19683 \u00f7 6 = 3280.5.\n\n3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36080, and 0.5 * 11 = 5.5, so total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5.\n\nNow, subtract 3/2 from that: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084.\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the recurrence relation approach, let me check another layer, say a_2.\n\nUsing the formula: a_2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15. Which matches our earlier calculation. Good.\n\nSimilarly, a_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 1.5 = 49.5 - 1.5 = 48. Correct again.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, I can be confident that the final result is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each layer step by step again to double-check.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nYep, same result each time. So I think that's solid.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute Layer 9 again just to be absolutely sure.\n\nLayer 8: 12027.\n\nSo, Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*(12028) = ?\n\nCompute 12028 * 3:\n\n12000*3 = 36000.\n\n28*3 = 84.\n\nSo, total is 36000 + 84 = 36084.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlright, so after all these steps and double-checking, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 36084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1.

    "text": " Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like each layer is of the form $3(1 + ... )$. Since there are multiple layers, maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions.\n\nLet me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, which is just $1+3$, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me check:\n\n1. Innermost: $1 + 3$\n2. Next layer: $1 + 3(1 + 3)$\n3. Then: $1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))$\n4. Continuing this way, it seems like there are nine layers in total because each time we add another set of parentheses, and the outermost multiplication by 3 is at the end.\n\nWait, let me count again to be sure. Each opening parenthesis adds a new layer, and the problem has nine sets of parentheses starting from the innermost. So, yes, there are nine layers of nesting before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nMaybe I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the inside and moving outward. That way, each time I compute a layer, I can substitute it into the next one. Let me try that.\n\nLet's define each layer as follows:\n\n- Let\u2019s denote $A_1 = 1 + 3$\n- Then, $A_2 = 1 + 3A_1$\n- Then, $A_3 = 1 + 3A_2$\n- And so on, up to $A_9 = 1 + 3A_8$\n\nAfter computing $A_9$, the entire expression would be $3A_9$.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, it's $3(1 + 3(...))$, so actually, the outermost operation is 3 times the sum. So, yes, after computing all the inner layers up to $A_9$, we multiply by 3.\n\nLet me start computing each $A_i$ step by step.\n\nStarting with $A_1$:\n\n$A_1 = 1 + 3 = 4$\n\nOkay, that's straightforward.\n\nNow, moving to $A_2$:\n\n$A_2 = 1 + 3A_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13$\n\nGot it. So $A_2$ is 13.\n\nNext, $A_3$:\n\n$A_3 = 1 + 3A_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40$\n\nHmm, 40. So far, so good.\n\nNow, $A_4$:\n\n$A_4 = 1 + 3A_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121$\n\n121. Okay, that's a three-digit number now.\n\nProceeding to $A_5$:\n\n$A_5 = 1 + 3A_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364$\n\n364. Hmm, each time it's tripling the previous result and adding 1.\n\nMoving on to $A_6$:\n\n$A_6 = 1 + 3A_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093$\n\n1093. That's a four-digit number now.\n\nNext, $A_7$:\n\n$A_7 = 1 + 3A_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280$\n\n3280. Wow, it's growing quickly.\n\nNow, $A_8$:\n\n$A_8 = 1 + 3A_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841$\n\n9841. Okay, now that's a four-digit number as well, but much larger.\n\nFinally, $A_9$:\n\n$A_9 = 1 + 3A_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524$\n\nSo, $A_9$ is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times $A_9$, so:\n\n$3A_9 = 3*29524$\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication because it's easy to make a mistake with so many digits.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each $A_i$. It's easy to miscalculate one of the steps, which would throw off the entire result.\n\nLet me go through each step again quickly:\n\n- $A_1 = 1 + 3 = 4$ \u2705\n- $A_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13$ \u2705\n- $A_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40$ \u2705\n- $A_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121$ \u2705\n- $A_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364$ \u2705\n- $A_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093$ \u2705\n- $A_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280$ \u2705\n- $A_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841$ \u2705\n- $A_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524$ \u2705\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, each step seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each step manually. Since each layer is of the form $A_{n} = 1 + 3A_{n-1}$, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is $A_n = aA_{n-1} + b$, where in this case, a = 3 and b = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by:\n\n$A_n = a^n A_0 + \\frac{b(a^n - 1)}{a - 1}$\n\nWhere $A_0$ is the initial term. In our case, $A_1 = 4$, so if I consider $A_0$ as the term before $A_1$, which would be when n=0, but in our case, we start at n=1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to index it starting from n=0. Let me adjust that.\n\nLet\u2019s say n starts at 0, with $A_0 = 1 + 3 = 4$? Wait, no, because the innermost term is $1 + 3$, which is 4, so that's $A_1$. So perhaps $A_n$ is defined for n from 1 to 9, where $A_1 = 4$, and each subsequent $A_n = 1 + 3A_{n-1}$.\n\nIn that case, the general solution for a linear recurrence like $A_n = aA_{n-1} + b$ is:\n\n$A_n = a^{n} A_0 + \\frac{b(a^{n} - 1)}{a - 1}$\n\nBut in our case, the recurrence starts at n=1 with $A_1 = 4$, so perhaps $A_0$ is not defined here. Alternatively, we can adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nWait, let's see. The homogeneous solution is $A_n^{(h)} = C \\cdot 3^n$, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution $A_n^{(p)} = K$. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\n$K = 3K + 1$\n\nSolving for K:\n\n$K - 3K = 1$\n\n$-2K = 1$\n\n$K = -\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSo the general solution is:\n\n$A_n = C \\cdot 3^n - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's take n=1, where $A_1 = 4$:\n\n$4 = C \\cdot 3^1 - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$4 = 3C - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nAdding $\\frac{1}{2}$ to both sides:\n\n$4 + \\frac{1}{2} = 3C$\n\n$\\frac{9}{2} = 3C$\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n$C = \\frac{9}{2} / 3 = \\frac{3}{2}$\n\nSo the general formula is:\n\n$A_n = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 3^n - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$\n\nTherefore, $A_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}$\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\n$A_1 = \\frac{3^{2} - 1}{2} = \\frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4$ \u2705\n\nn=2:\n\n$A_2 = \\frac{3^3 - 1}{2} = \\frac{27 - 1}{2} = 13$ \u2705\n\nn=3:\n\n$A_3 = \\frac{3^4 - 1}{2} = \\frac{81 - 1}{2} = 40$ \u2705\n\nGreat, so the formula works. So for n=9, which is our $A_9$, we have:\n\n$A_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2}$\n\nCompute $3^{10}$:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, $A_9 = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \\frac{59048}{2} = 29524$ \u2705\n\nWhich matches the value we computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 times $A_9$, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each step manually or use the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form $3(1 + \\text{previous layer})$. By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series with nine layers, each of the form $3(1 + \\text{previous layer})$.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - $A_1 = 1 + 3 = 4$\n   - $A_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n   - $A_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n   - $A_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n   - $A_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$\n   - $A_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$\n   - $A_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$\n   - $A_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$\n   - $A_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost 3**: The entire expression is $3 \\times A_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572$.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, maybe I should just start evaluating from the inside and see.\n\nLet me start by evaluating the innermost parentheses first:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(result from innermost) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13\n\nOkay, so the next layer out is 13.\n\nNow, moving out another layer, we have:\n\n1 + 3*(result from previous layer) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCompute that:\n\n3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAlright, so now we have 40.\n\nNext layer out:\n\n1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nWait, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\nProceeding further out:\n\n1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\nNext layer:\n\n1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\nContinuing out:\n\n1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so 3000+279=3279. Plus 1 is 3280.\n\nNext layer:\n\n1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841.\n\nMoving out another layer:\n\n1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so 27000+2523=29523. Plus 1 is 29524.\n\nNext layer out:\n\n1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\n3*29524: 20000*3=60000, 9524*3=28572, so 60000+28572=88572. Plus 1 is 88573.\n\nProceeding to the next layer:\n\n1 + 3*(88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n\n3*88573: 80000*3=240000, 8573*3=25719, so 240000+25719=265719. Plus 1 is 265720.\n\nNow, moving out to the outermost layer:\n\n1 + 3*(265720) = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n\n3*265720: 200000*3=600000, 65720*3=197160, so 600000+197160=797160. Plus 1 is 797161.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3:\n\n3*(result from outermost layer) = 3*797161\n\nLet me compute that. 700000*3=2100000, 97161*3: 90000*3=270000, 7161*3=21483, so 270000+21483=291483. So total is 2100000 + 291483 = 2391483.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 797161 * 3:\n\n700000*3=2,100,000\n\n90,000*3=270,000\n\n7,000*3=21,000\n\n100*3=300\n\n60*3=180\n\n1*3=3\n\nWait, maybe I broke it down incorrectly before. Let me try another way:\n\n797,161\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n700,000 + 90,000 + 7,000 + 100 + 60 + 1\n\nMultiply each by 3:\n\n700,000*3=2,100,000\n\n90,000*3=270,000\n\n7,000*3=21,000\n\n100*3=300\n\n60*3=180\n\n1*3=3\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n2,100,000 + 270,000 = 2,370,000\n\n2,370,000 + 21,000 = 2,391,000\n\n2,391,000 + 300 = 2,391,300\n\n2,391,300 + 180 = 2,391,480\n\n2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483\n\nSo, 3*797,161 = 2,391,483\n\nTherefore, the final result is 2,391,483.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. It's easy to miscount the layers or miscalculate a multiplication. Let me go through the layers again step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on, earlier I thought there were nine layers, but in my initial computation, I went up to 265,720 and then multiplied by 3 to get 797,161. But according to this count, there are nine layers, so after the ninth layer, we have 29,524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29,524), which would be 88,572, and then perhaps another layer? Wait, maybe I miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of parentheses. Let's look at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. So starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n\n2. Then each time we go out, we add another 1 + 3*(...). So how many times does this happen?\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3(, there are eight more 3( inside. Wait, maybe not. Let me count the number of 3(:\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3( is at the beginning, then each subsequent 3( is nested inside. Let me count the number of 3(:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 3(\n3. 3(\n4. 3(\n5. 3(\n6. 3(\n7. 3(\n8. 3(\n9. 3(\n\nSo, there are nine 3(, meaning nine layers. Therefore, the innermost is the ninth layer, which is 1 + 3. Then each layer outwards is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after nine layers, the result is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is multiplied by 3, so 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went beyond that, which might have been a mistake. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me write each layer step by step with their results:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, the result is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had more layers. So perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" inside:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n\nThen, each time we have \"1 + 3(\", so let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3(, there are eight more 3( before the innermost. Wait, no, actually, the innermost is the ninth layer because each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each \"1 + 3(\" represents a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1 + 3(\" expressions. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression:\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time I see \"1 + 3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nWait, actually, the last one is 1 + 3, without a closing parenthesis yet. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, and each preceding \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have nine layers, each time adding a new \"1 + 3*(...)\".\n\nTherefore, after nine layers, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, and each layer outwards is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, as I calculated before, after nine layers, the result is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went beyond that, which suggests I might have miscounted the layers. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers because I included the outermost 3( as a separate layer. Let me try to visualize the expression with layers:\n\nThe outermost is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...). So, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, each \"1 + 3*(...)\" is a new layer. So, let's list them:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after nine layers, we reach 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I had more layers, which suggests I might have included the outermost 3*(...) as an additional layer, but actually, the outermost is just the multiplication by 3, not another \"1 + 3*(...)\" layer.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by considering the outermost 3*(...) as another layer, which it isn't. Therefore, after nine layers, we have 29,524, and then the final result is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again to make sure. The original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3*( layer1 )\n\nwhere layer1 = 1 + 3*( layer2 )\n\nlayer2 = 1 + 3*( layer3 )\n\n...\n\nup to layer9 = 1 + 3\n\nSo, yes, nine layers, each time evaluating 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after nine layers, the result is 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the final result was 2,391,483, which is way larger. So, I must have made a mistake in counting the layers.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" after the first 3( adds a new layer. So, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer.\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" after the first 3(:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3\n\nSo, that's nine \"1 + 3(\" expressions, meaning nine layers. Therefore, after nine layers, we have 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went beyond that, which suggests I must have miscounted. Alternatively, perhaps the outermost 3*(...) is also a layer, making it ten layers. Let me check.\n\nWait, the outermost is 3*(...), where the ... is layer1. So, layer1 is the first \"1 + 3*(...)\", which is layer1 = 1 + 3*(layer2), and so on until layer9 = 1 + 3. So, the outermost is just 3*(layer1), which is not another layer but the final multiplication.\n\nTherefore, the total number of layers is nine, each being a \"1 + 3*(...)\" expression, starting from the innermost. So, after nine layers, we have 29,524, and then the final result is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but that seems too small, considering that each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me test with a smaller number of layers to see if my approach is correct.\n\nFor example, let's take a smaller version: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute this step by step.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nOutermost: 3*40 = 120\n\nSo, with three layers inside, the result is 120. Let me compute it directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)), that's two layers inside.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nOutermost: 3*13 = 39\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, in the original problem, with nine layers inside, each time adding 1 + 3*(previous), leading to 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went further, which suggests I might have included the outermost multiplication as another layer, which it's not. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the outermost 3*(...) as another layer, which it isn't. Therefore, the correct result should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check with another smaller example to be sure.\n\nTake 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\nThat's four layers inside.\n\nCompute step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nOutermost: 3*121 = 363\n\nCompute directly:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n\n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)))\n\n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)))\n\n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*13))\n\n= 3(1 + 3(1 + 39))\n\n= 3(1 + 3*40)\n\n= 3(1 + 120)\n\n= 3*121 = 363\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, applying this to the original problem, which has nine layers inside, the result after nine layers is 29,524, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial mistake was including the outermost multiplication as another layer, which it's not. So, the correct answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again by computing step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*29,524 again to be sure.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed step by step, and the final result is obtained by multiplying the innermost result by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Substitute back into the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   - 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n4. Multiply the result by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. It seems like a recursive or repetitive structure. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, we have 3 multiplied by that result. So the next step is:\n\n3 * (1 + 3) = 3 * 4 = 12\n\nWait, no, actually, let me check. The structure is 3(1 + 3(...)). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next level). So starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, hold on, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but let me count the layers again to make sure I didn't miscount. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + ...)\n3. 3*(1 + ...)\n...\nUp to nine layers. So, yes, Layer 9 would be the outermost one.\n\nBut let me verify each step to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nHmm, that seems consistent each time. Each layer is 3 times (1 plus the previous layer). So starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous). So that's a geometric progression perhaps?\n\nWait, let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this without computing each layer step by step. Maybe I can find a general formula for such nested expressions.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, the recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nWith the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, solving this recurrence relation might give me a formula to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer.\n\nLet's try to solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be written as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3\n\nWait, no, actually, it's a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 3\n\nC - 3C = 3\n\n-2C = 3\n\nC = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-3/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)\n\n4 = 3A - 3/2\n\nAdd 3/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 3/2 = 3A\n\nConvert 4 to 8/2:\n\n8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3A\n\nSo, A = (11/2) / 3 = 11/6\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^n)/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2\n\nSo, a_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nTherefore, for n=9:\n\na_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^8:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\nSo, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2\n\nCompute 11*6561:\n\n11*6000 = 66000\n\n11*561 = 6171\n\nSo, total is 66000 + 6171 = 72171\n\nThen, subtract 3: 72171 - 3 = 72168\n\nDivide by 2: 72168 / 2 = 36084\n\nSo, a_9 = 36084, which matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier. That's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is 36084.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the recurrence relation approach, let me cross-verify with the step-by-step computation.\n\nEarlier, I computed each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 15\n\nLayer 3: 48\n\nLayer 4: 147\n\nLayer 5: 444\n\nLayer 6: 1335\n\nLayer 7: 4008\n\nLayer 8: 12027\n\nLayer 9: 36084\n\nYes, that's consistent with the formula result. So, I think 36084 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, so perhaps it's similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nBut in this case, the expression is more like a nested multiplication, so the recurrence approach seems appropriate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), which can be expanded as 3 + 3*previous layer. So, each term is 3 more than three times the previous term. That's why the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and solving it, we find that the value at layer 9 is 36084.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation method give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 3 times (1 plus the previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 36084.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: (1 + 3) = 4.\n2. Each subsequent layer is computed as 3*(1 + previous layer).\n3. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: 4\n   - Layer 2: 15\n   - Layer 3: 48\n   - Layer 4: 147\n   - Layer 5: 444\n   - Layer 6: 1335\n   - Layer 7: 4008\n   - Layer 8: 12027\n   - Layer 9: 36084\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{36084}"

    "text": " Let me try to visualize it better.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. So, let me rewrite the expression to make sure I have it right:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nOkay, so starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is (1 + 3( result from above )). Wait, let me make sure. The next level out would be (1 + 3*(previous result)). Hmm, but let me count how many levels there are. Let me see, each time I have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + something). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see: starting from the innermost, each step adds another layer. Let me count how many times 3 is multiplied.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step, computing each layer one by one. So, let's start from the innermost and move outward.\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost parentheses:\n(1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving out one level, we have:\n(1 + 3*(result from step 1)) = (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nWait, let me check that. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the innermost was 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Okay, that's correct.\n\nStep 2: Next layer out is (1 + 3*13). Let's compute that:\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, hold on, no. Let me make sure. Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after step 1, we had 4. Then step 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then step 3 would be 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm counting the steps correctly. Each time I compute a layer, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, step 1: 4, step 2: 13, step 3: 40, etc.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me try to write down each step clearly.\n\nLet me assign each layer a number from inside out, starting at layer 1 as the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*(Layer 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*(Layer 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*(Layer 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*(Layer 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*(Layer 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), so let's count the number of times this occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. (1 + 3(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, I think. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times we have a 3 followed by a (1 + ...). Let me see:\n\n- The innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer out adds another 3(1 + ...). So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(...):\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is a (1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is 9. Wait, because from the innermost (1 + 3) up to the 9th layer, each time we have a 3 multiplied by a (1 + ...). So, perhaps there are 9 layers. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + ...), so up to layer 9.\n\nSo, I think I have 9 layers to compute, each time computing (1 + 3*(previous result)), starting from 4.\n\nWait, but when I did the layers earlier, I got up to layer 9 as 29524, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me go through each layer step by step, carefully.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nLayer 2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nOkay, so Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nSo, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step? Maybe a geometric series or something.\n\nLooking at each layer, each time we have a term that's 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if we denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me try to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2.\n\nBut in this case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm once again with the step-by-step computation, because I don't want to make any mistakes.\n\nSo, layers:\n\n1:4\n\n2:13\n\n3:40\n\n4:121\n\n5:364\n\n6:1093\n\n7:3280\n\n8:9841\n\n9:29524\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Innermost layer: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. Next layer: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n4. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121$\n5. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364$\n6. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093$\n7. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280$\n8. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841$\n9. Next: $1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524$\n\nFinally, multiplying the outermost 3:\n\n$3 \\times 29524 = 88572$\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each multiplied by 3. It seems like each level is of the form 3*(1 + something). Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, let me write down the expression more clearly, maybe even label each part to keep track. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost part:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1)\n3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until I reach the outermost layer.\n\nWait, so there are multiple layers here. Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer, so let me see:\n\nStarting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI think there are 9 layers here because each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and I can see 9 sets of parentheses. Let me check:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3\n2. Then the next is 1 + 3*(1+3)\n3. Then 1 + 3*(previous result)\n4. Continuing this way, up to 9 layers.\n\nHmm, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see 8 more, so maybe it's 9 layers in total. Let me confirm by writing them out:\n\n- Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- ...\n- Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So I'll need to compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply the result by 3 as the outermost operation.\n\nAlright, let's start computing each layer one by one.\n\n**Layer 1: 1 + 3**\nThat's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\n**Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)**\nSo, Layer 1 is 4. Plugging that in: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n**Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)**\nLayer 2 is 13. So, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n**Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)**\nLayer 3 is 40. So, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n**Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)**\nLayer 4 is 121. So, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n**Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)**\nLayer 5 is 364. So, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n**Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)**\nLayer 6 is 1093. So, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n**Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)**\nLayer 7 is 3280. So, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n**Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)**\nLayer 8 is 9841. So, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me verify these calculations because some of these numbers are getting quite large, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication or addition.\n\nStarting again:\n\n**Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4** \u2013 that's correct.\n\n**Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13** \u2013 correct.\n\n**Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40** \u2013 correct.\n\n**Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121** \u2013 correct.\n\n**Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364** \u2013 correct.\n\n**Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093** \u2013 correct.\n\n**Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280** \u2013 correct.\n\n**Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841** \u2013 correct.\n\n**Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524** \u2013 correct.\n\nOkay, so each step seems accurate. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is:\n\n**Final result: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524**\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 multiplied by 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000\n\nNext, 500 * 3 = 1500\n\nThen, 20 * 3 = 60\n\nAnd 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding these up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems high, but let me check 29524 * 3 another way.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify once more because 9 layers each multiplying by 3 and adding 1, so is there a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step?\n\nHmm, this expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolving for C:\n\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, so for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods agree. Therefore, I'm confident the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2. 243*243: 200*200=40,000, but actually, 243*243 is 59,049. So, yes, 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 is 59,048/2=29,524. Correct.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

It seems like each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). So, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nCounting the number of 3s, I see there are nine 3s multiplied, each corresponding to a layer. So, the innermost part is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 and multiplies by 3. Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(result from step 1) = 3*4 = 12\n3. Next: 1 + 12 = 13\n4. Then: 3*13 = 39\n5. Next: 1 + 39 = 40\n6. Then: 3*40 = 120\n7. Next: 1 + 120 = 121\n8.

Next: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n16. Then: 3*9841 = 29523\n17. Next: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n18. Then: 3*29524 = 88572\n19. Next: 1 + 88572 = 88573\n20. Then: 3*88573 = 265719\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine 3s, so the innermost is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplication. So, starting from the innermost, each step should be:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 3*(4) = 12\n3. 1 + 12 = 13\n4. 3*(13) = 39\n5. 1 + 39 = 40\n6. 3*(40) = 120\n7. 1 + 120 = 121\n8. 3*(121) = 363\n9. 1 + 363 = 364\n10. 3*(364) = 1092\n11. 1 + 1092 = 1093\n12. 3*(1093) = 3279\n13. 1 + 3279 = 3280\n14. 3*(3280) = 9840\n15. 1 + 9840 = 9841\n16. 3*(9841) = 29523\n17. 1 + 29523 = 29524\n18. 3*(29524) = 88572\n19. 1 + 88572 = 88573\n20. 3*(88573) = 265719\n\nHmm, that seems like 20 steps, but I think I might have miscounted because each layer corresponds to a 3, and there are nine 3s. Let me try again, perhaps writing each layer as a separate step.\n\nLet me denote each layer from the innermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nWait, but the original expression has nine 3s, so perhaps Layer 9 is 3*(Layer 8). Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nStarting from the first 3, the structure is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, there's a 3 followed by (1 + ...). Let's count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3 is outside.\n2. Then, inside, we have 3(...), so that's another 3.\n3. Then, inside that, another 3(...), and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of 3s is 9, each corresponding to a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 3 multiplication.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nLet me define each layer as follows, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: Multiply by 3: 3 * 4 = 12\n\nStep 3: Add 1: 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 4: Multiply by 3: 3 * 13 = 39\n\nStep 5: Add 1: 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 6: Multiply by 3: 3 * 40 = 120\n\nStep 7: Add 1: 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 8: Multiply by 3: 3 * 121 = 363\n\nStep 9: Add 1: 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 10: Multiply by 3: 3 * 364 = 1092\n\nStep 11: Add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 12: Multiply by 3: 3 * 1093 = 3279\n\nStep 13: Add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 14: Multiply by 3: 3 * 3280 = 9840\n\nStep 15: Add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 16: Multiply by 3: 3 * 9841 = 29523\n\nStep 17: Add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nStep 18: Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nStep 19: Add 1: 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nStep 20: Multiply by 3: 3 * 88573 = 265719\n\nWait, that seems like 20 steps, but I think I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try again, perhaps using a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to represent each layer as a function. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Each layer is 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(1) = 1 + 3.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s say:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12\n\nLayer 3: 1 + Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39\n\nLayer 5: 1 + Layer 4 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120\n\nLayer 7: 1 + Layer 6 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363\n\nLayer 9: 1 + Layer 8 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 10: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nLayer 11: 1 + Layer 10 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 12: 3*(Layer 11) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nLayer 13: 1 + Layer 12 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 14: 3*(Layer 13) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nLayer 15: 1 + Layer 14 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 16: 3*(Layer 15) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nLayer 17: 1 + Layer 16 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nLayer 18: 3*(Layer 17) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nLayer 19: 1 + Layer 18 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nLayer 20: 3*(Layer 19) = 3*88573 = 265719\n\nWait, but the original expression only has nine 3s, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by going to 20 layers. Let me recount the expression.\n\nLooking back at the original problem:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nEach time, after the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), so the number of 3s is 9, meaning there are 9 layers. Let me try to count the number of 3s.\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) adds another 3. So, the structure is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let me try to compute each layer step by step, only up to 9 layers.\n\nWait, but when I tried earlier, I ended up with 265719, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recursive function.\n\nLet me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Each layer is f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, so f(1) = 4\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nWait, but that doesn't match my earlier calculation. Wait, perhaps I'm misdefining the function.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then the next is 1 + 15 = 16, then 3*(1 + 16) = 51, and so on.\n\nWait, but that seems different from my initial approach. Let me try that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier by alternately adding 1 and multiplying by 3, but maybe it's actually 3*(1 + previous layer), so each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, let's try that.\n\nSo, f(1) = 4 (since 1 + 3 = 4)\n\nf(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nf(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nf(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nf(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nf(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nf(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nf(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nf(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but that's only 9 layers, and f(9) = 36084. But when I computed earlier step by step, I ended up with 265719, which is much larger. So, I must be making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps my function definition is wrong. Let me look back at the original expression.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). But in my function above, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting with f(1)=4.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, after the innermost 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" after the first 3 represents a new layer, so let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 3(1 + 3(\n3. 3(1 + 3(\n4. 3(1 + 3(\n5. 3(1 + 3(\n6. 3(1 + 3(\n7. 3(1 + 3(\n8. 3(1 + 3(\n9. 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, that's 9 layers after the first 3, making it 10 layers in total? Or perhaps 9 layers in total because the first 3 is outside.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 instances of 3*. So, the number of layers is 9.\n\nSo, perhaps f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4, as I did before, but then f(9) would be 36084, but earlier when I computed step by step, I got 265719, which is way larger.\n\nI think I must have made a mistake in my initial step-by-step computation because I alternated between adding 1 and multiplying by 3 incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), so starting with f(1) = 4, then f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, f(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, f(4)=3*(1+48)=147, f(5)=3*(1+147)=444, f(6)=3*(1+444)=1335, f(7)=3*(1+1335)=4008, f(8)=3*(1+4008)=12027, f(9)=3*(1+12027)=36084.\n\nSo, according to this, the result should be 36084.\n\nBut earlier, when I did the step-by-step, I ended up with 265719, which is much larger. So, I must have messed up the order of operations.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), so after computing each layer, you have to add 1 before multiplying by 3 in the next layer.\n\nWait, but in my function f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1)=4, that seems to fit the structure.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outwards, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\nThen, next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\nThen: 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\nThen: 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\nThen: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\nThen: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\nThen: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\nThen: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but when I did the step-by-step earlier, I ended up with 265719, which is way off. So, perhaps I made a mistake in that approach by not correctly applying the operations.\n\nWait, let me try to compute it again, more carefully.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nSo, after 9 layers, the result is 36084.\n\nWait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond 9 layers, which was incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers. So, I think 36084 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by computing it another way. Maybe using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or a formula.\n\nLet me consider that each layer is f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Let's try to find a closed-form formula.\n\nThe recursive relation is f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)).\n\nLet me expand it:\n\nf(n) = 3 + 3*f(n-1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution f_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A:\n\nA - 3A = 3\n\n-2A = 3 => A = -3/2\n\nSo, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 3/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition f(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3C - 1.5\n\n3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5\n\nC = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nSo, f(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6\n\nSo, f(n) = (11*3^{n}) / 6 - 3/2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nf(n) = (11*3^{n} - 9) / 6\n\nNow, let's compute f(9):\n\nf(9) = (11*3^9 - 9) / 6\n\nCompute 3^9:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\nSo, f(9) = (11*19683 - 9)/6\n\nCompute 11*19683:\n\n19683 * 10 = 196830\n\n19683 * 1 = 19683\n\nTotal = 196830 + 19683 = 216,513\n\nThen subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504\n\nNow, divide by 6: 216,504 / 6 = 36,084\n\nSo, f(9) = 36,084\n\nThat matches the earlier computation. So, the answer should be 36,084.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the step-by-step, I went beyond 9 layers and got 265,719, which is wrong. So, I must have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nWait, perhaps the original expression has 9 layers, so the correct answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, let me check the original expression again to ensure I have 9 layers.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"3(\" after the first 3, I see there are 9 of them, each corresponding to a layer. So, yes, 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it manually again, step by step, to make sure.\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Next: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\n9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that's 9 steps, and the result is 36,084.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 36,084.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{36084}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

    "text": " Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3. It seems like each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards, it'll be easier to handle. That makes sense because parentheses dictate the order of operations, so innermost ones should be calculated first.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\n\nHmm, let's count how many times this nesting happens. Each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps that with 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It looks like there are nine sets of parentheses, each adding another layer. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let\u2019s say:\n\n- Let\u2019s start with the innermost expression: a\u2081 = 1 + 3\n- Then, the next layer out would be a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081\n- Then, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082\n- And so on, until a\u2089, and then the entire expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the original problem, the outermost multiplication by 3 is outside the first set of parentheses. So maybe I should adjust my indices accordingly. Let me think.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the first innermost is (1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on, until the ninth layer, and then the entire expression is 3*(the ninth layer).\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of layers correctly. Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then each (1 + 3(...)) is a layer. So:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3*(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nLet me count how many times 1 + 3*(...) occurs. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections.\n\n1. The first one is 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n2. Then inside that, another (1 + 3*(...))\n3. Continuing this way, how many times does this happen?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think that each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and another addition of 1. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have n layers, each layer is defined as a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nBut how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each (1 + 3(...) is an opening parenthesis, so let's see:\n\n- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each (1 + 3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections:\n\n1. The innermost is (1 + 3)\n2. Then moving out, each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each (1 + 3(...) is nested 9 times. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each step out adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: a\u2081 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen layer 2: a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081\n\nLayer 3: a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082\n\nAnd so on, until layer 9: a\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...). So, if I have 9 layers inside, then the total expression is 3*a\u2089, where a\u2089 is the 9th layer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should index starting from a\u2080. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me try to index each layer properly. Let me consider the innermost as a\u2081 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, moving outwards:\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nYes, that seems correct because each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, I can compute each a_i step by step, starting from a\u2081, then a\u2082, up to a\u2089, and then multiply the result by 3.\n\nLet me write down each step:\n\nFirst, a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, a\u2084 = 1 + 3*a\u2083 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*a\u2084 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*a\u2085 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*a\u2086 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*a\u2087 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*a\u2088 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\n\n3*9000 = 27000 \u2192 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n3*500 = 1500 \u2192 87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n3*24 = 72 \u2192 88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with a\u2081:\n\na\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\na\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without calculating each step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can recognize that each a_i follows the recurrence relation a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_i.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_i = A*3^{i} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve it.\n\nGiven a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{i}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_i = A*3^{i} - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a\u2081 = 4:\n\na\u2081 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^{i} - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2\n\nThus, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor i = 1: a\u2081 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor i = 2: a\u2082 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor i = 3: a\u2083 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor i = 4: a\u2084 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor i = 5: a\u2085 = (3^{6} - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor i = 6: a\u2086 = (3^{7} - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor i = 7: a\u2087 = (3^{8} - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor i = 8: a\u2088 = (3^{9} - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor i = 9: a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works. So, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a\u2089 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a\u2089 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThus, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's another way to compute it using the closed-form formula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify the final multiplication:\n\n3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 7 7 5 7 2.\n\nWait, let me do it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext: 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits together: 8 7 7 5 7 2, which is 877572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572, not 877572. Wait, perhaps I misaligned the digits.\n\nWait, perhaps I should write it as:\n\n29524\n\n\u00d7      3\n\n--------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9\u00d73=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 877572? Wait, that can't be because 29524 \u00d73 is definitely less than 90000\u00d73=270000, but 877572 is way larger. So, I must have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, no, 29524 \u00d73 is actually:\n\nLet me compute it correctly:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext: 5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\nNext: 9\u00d73=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so the multiplication should be:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nCompute digit by digit:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 877572? But that's 6 digits, which is correct because 29524 is 5 digits, times 3 is up to 6 digits.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 3*29524=88572, but that's only 5 digits, which is impossible because 29524 is 5 digits, so 3*29524 must be 5 or 6 digits. Wait, 29524 \u00d73:\n\nLet me compute it correctly using another method.\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d73:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d73 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d73 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d73 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d73 = 60\n\n4 \u00d73 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12= 88572\n\nAh, there we go. So, 29524 \u00d73 = 88572.\n\nI must have miscounted the digits earlier. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me use another method to compute 3*29524.\n\nCompute 29524 \u00d73:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9\u00d73=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from top to bottom: 8 7 7 5 7 2, which is 877572. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous correct method.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. There must be a mistake in the way I'm writing the digits.\n\nWait, when I do the multiplication:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext: 9\u00d73=27 \u2192 write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,7,7,8.\n\nWait, that's 877572, but that's incorrect because we know it should be 88572.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused with the digit positions.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\nNext: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8.\n\nWait, but that's 5 digits, but 29524 \u00d73 should be 6 digits because 29524 is just under 30000, and 30000\u00d73=90000, which is 5 digits, but 29524\u00d73 is 88572, which is 5 digits. Wait, but 29524 is 5 digits, 3\u00d729524 is 5 digits as well because 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, so when I write the digits, I should have:\n\nAfter multiplying:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8.\n\nWait, that's 5 digits: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nI must have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 877572. Probably, I misaligned the digits.\n\nSo, to clarify, the correct multiplication is:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7, carryover 0.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8, carryover 0.\n\nSo, the result is 88572, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, all steps check out, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression is (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each step, verifying each layer, and cross-checking with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one.

    "text": " Let me try to parse this.\n\nFirst, I notice that it's a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. Each layer seems to follow a pattern: starting from the innermost part, it's 1 plus 3 times something. So, maybe I can work from the inside out, solving each innermost parentheses first and then moving outward. That seems like a logical approach.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1+3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, I can think of this as a recursive or iterative process where each step depends on the previous one.\n\nLet me denote each layer as follows:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n...\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9, since I count nine sets of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of layers properly. The expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1+3), each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*something. Let me count the number of innermost expressions. Each time I see a 1+3, that's a starting point.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have a 1+3 before the outermost 3. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(result of step 1)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(result of step 2)\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nLet me try to count how many layers there are. Each time we have a 1+3, that's a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(result of step 1)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(result of step 2)\n4. Then, 1 + 3*(result of step 3)\n5. Then, 1 + 3*(result of step 4)\n6. Then, 1 + 3*(result of step 5)\n7. Then, 1 + 3*(result of step 6)\n8. Then, 1 + 3*(result of step 7)\n9. Then, 1 + 3*(result of step 8)\n10. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(result of step 9)\n\nWait, so that's 10 layers? Let me check. Each time, we have a 1+3, so starting from the innermost, each layer is a new 1+3. So, counting from the innermost to the outermost, it's 9 layers before the outermost 3. So, total layers including the outermost 3 would be 10. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3)\nStep 2: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(Step 1)\nStep 3: Compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(Step 2)\n...\nContinue until all layers are computed, and finally multiply by 3.\n\nYes, that seems manageable. Let me start computing each step.\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(Step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(Step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(Step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(Step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(Step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(Step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nStep 10: Finally, multiply by 3: 3*(Step 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check. The initial expression is 3*(...), so after computing Step 9, which is the innermost layer, we have to compute up to Step 9, and then multiply by 3 for the outermost layer. Wait, but in my earlier counting, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount.\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds one more 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of innermost (1 + 3) expressions.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. Then, 1 + 3*(1)\n3. Then, 1 + 3*(2)\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to see how many times we have a 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3*\" appears before the outermost 3.\n\nLet me parse it:\n\n- The first layer after the outermost 3 is: 1 + 3*(...)\n- Inside that, the next layer is: 1 + 3*(...)\n- And so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3).\n\nSo, how many times does \"1 + 3*\" occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*(.\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first ( after 3*, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first one:\n\nAfter the first (, we have 1 + 3*(...), which itself contains another (, and so on. So, how many ( are there?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3*(1 + 3*(...\n2. Then, inside, 1 + 3*(...\n3. Then, another 1 + 3*(...\n4. Another one...\n5. Another one...\n6. Another one...\n7. Another one...\n8. Another one...\n9. Another one...\n10. Finally, (1 + 3)\n\nSo, from the outermost 3*, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), each nested inside the previous one, with the innermost being (1 + 3). Therefore, the total number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost.\n\nWait, so that means I have 9 layers to compute, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer up to the 9th layer, and then the outermost 3*(...). Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the count. Let me try to index them properly.\n\nLet me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost as Layer 1 to Layer 9, and then the outermost multiplication by 3 would be Layer 10.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think that each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), that's a new layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, let me try to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost.\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so:\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 30000 * 3 = 90000\n\nBut 29524 is 30000 - 476.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n---------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miss any.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the computations look consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous term.\n\nLet me define the recurrence relation:\n\nLet a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but actually, a_1 is (1 + 3) = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, which might have saved time instead of computing each layer.\n\nThe general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find A and B.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nFor n=2:\n\na_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches.\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the 9th layer, which is a_9, would be:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1 =3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, using the closed-form solution of the recurrence relation, which might have been more efficient, especially for larger n.\n\nBut since the problem only had 9 layers, computing step by step was manageable. However, knowing the formula can save time in case of more layers.\n\nIn any case, both methods lead to the same result: 88,572.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check the multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series of operations that can be evaluated step by step starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

So, it's like a chain of operations, each one inside the other. Maybe the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each one starts with a 1, then adds 3 times another expression. So, it's like a repeated pattern. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part.\n\nLet me label each layer from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. That might help me keep track.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: The innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, let's compute that.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nWait, that's Layer 2. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Let me compute that.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nHmm, okay, moving on to Layer 4.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. That seems like a lot, but let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 gives me 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nLet me do that: 3*29524. Let me compute 29524*3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because the numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with Layer 1 through Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer is computed correctly, and the multiplication at the end is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or perhaps recognize a pattern.\n\nWait, let me think about it differently. Each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from the innermost, each term is built as 1 + 3 times the term before it. So, it's a recursive sequence.\n\nLet me denote the terms as a1, a2, ..., a9, where a1 is the innermost term.\n\na1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before. It seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, is there a formula for such a recursive sequence? Let me think.\n\nEach term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c)\n\nWhich leads to c = 3c, so c=0, which doesn't help. Alternatively, solving the recurrence:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition a1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nThus, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the recurrence relation, which confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.\n\n1.

    "text": " Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested series of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times something. It looks like a recursive kind of structure, where each inner expression is similar to the outer ones. So maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That seems like a logical approach because each step depends on the result of the previous one.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nI can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each one is of the form 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost one, which is 1 + 3, let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me compute that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so that gives me 13. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. Let me compute that:\n\nNext level: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, so it's 40 now. Continuing this pattern, the next level is:\n\n1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, that's a big jump. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. So each time, I take the result from the innermost expression and plug it into the next level. So far, I've done three levels, right? Let me count the number of times I've done this.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, that's nine levels, each time computing 1 + 3 times the previous result. So the innermost is level 1, and the outermost is level 9. So after computing all nine levels, the result is 29524.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is 3 times that expression. So the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So I need to compute 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n3 * 29524. Let's break it down:\n\n3 * 29,000 = 87,000\n3 * 524 = 1,572\nAdding them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me verify the multiplication step by step to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n3 * 3 = 9 + 2 = 11, write down 11.\n\nSo putting it all together: 88,572. That matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because sometimes when I'm doing mental math, I might make an error. So let's go through each level again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n9. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 +3=29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nSo after computing all nine levels, the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this value, which is 3 * 29,524.\n\nLet me compute 3 * 29,524 again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7.\n5 * 3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3=6 +1=7.\n9 * 3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n3 * 3=9 +2=11, write down 11.\n\nSo the result is 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because sometimes when dealing with larger numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - (476 * 3).\n\nCompute 476 * 3: 400*3=1,200; 70*3=210; 6*3=18. So 1,200 + 210 = 1,410 +18=1,428.\n\nThen, 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, but let me just check if I counted the number of levels correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each of the form (1 + 3(...)). So starting from the innermost, each step is one level. So I did nine levels, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, the entire expression is 3 times that ninth level result.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each level step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach level seems to follow the recurrence relation:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWith a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let me see. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1). So let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n=> K - 3K = 1\n=> -2K = 1\n=> K = -1/2\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n=> C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n levels, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have nine levels, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by computing step by step. So that's reassuring.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times a_9, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula for a_n, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the answer.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3 times the nested terms, which is 3*a_9, and a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that all adds up.\n\nSo, after verifying through multiple methods\u2014computing step by step, using the recurrence relation, and applying a closed-form formula\u2014I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and all methods converge to the same answer. So I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous result). By computing each level step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find the value inside the outermost parentheses to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, after computing the innermost, each step adds a layer.\n\nBut wait, the very first term is 3*(...), so after computing all the inner layers up to 29524, the outermost operation is 3*(29524), which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss a layer. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is another layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... So, the first 3 is followed by 1 + 3(...). Then, each time, another 3(1 + ...).\n\nWait, perhaps there are eight layers inside the first 3. Let me see:\n\nThe structure is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is L1.\n\nThen, each layer adds a 3*(...). So, the first layer inside is L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me count the number of layers again. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach '3(' adds a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the innermost is 1+3, then each '3(' adds a new layer. Let me count the number of '3(' after the initial 3:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...), so that's layer 1: 1 + 3(...)\n\n- Then, inside that, another 3(...), which is layer 2.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of '3(' after the first 3:\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach '3(' is a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1 + 3(...\n\n2. Inside that: 3(...\n\n3. Inside that: 3(...\n\n4. Inside that: 3(...\n\n5. Inside that: 3(...\n\n6. Inside that: 3(...\n\n7. Inside that: 3(...\n\n8. Inside that: 3(...\n\n9. Inside that: 3(...\n\nWait, but the innermost is 1 + 3, so the number of '3(' after the first is eight, making nine layers in total, including the first one.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then each layer outside adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1)\n\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2)\n\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3)\n\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4)\n\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5)\n\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6)\n\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7)\n\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8)\n\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nThen, the outermost operation is 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check the structure again to make sure. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, there are nine layers in total, each adding a 3*(...). So, after computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, the outermost operation is 3*29524, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me try again, perhaps by writing each step down.\n\nLet me define each layer as follows:\n\n- Let\u2019s start from the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. That's the base case.\n\n- Then, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\nSo, starting with:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each layer is built upon the previous one, and after nine layers, we get to 29524, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nBut let me verify the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the final step: 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n\n2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n\n9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n\n2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, perhaps I can compute it another way. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It seems like each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's more like a linear recurrence.\n\nIn general, for such expressions, the value can be calculated using the formula for a geometric series, but let me check.\n\nThe expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) n times.\n\nIn this case, n is 9 layers, so the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after n layers, the value would be (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test that formula.\n\nLet me see, for n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches Layer 3.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches Layer 4.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f, Layer 5.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f, Layer 6.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f, Layer 7.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f, Layer 8.\n\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, Layer 9.\n\nSo, the formula holds for each layer. Therefore, the value after 9 layers is 29524, and then the outermost operation is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the total expression can be represented as 3*( (3^10 -1)/2 ) = (3^11 -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. That confirms that the result is indeed 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, used two different methods (iterative layer-by-layer computation and the geometric series formula) to arrive at the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Use this result to compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. Finally, multiply the result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with a 1 plus 3 times something. It seems like a recursive kind of structure, where each part depends on the result of the next. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll be easier.\n\nSo, the innermost part is $1+3$. Let me compute that first. $1 + 3$ is 4. Okay, so that part is straightforward. Now, moving one level out, the next part is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$. The something here would be the result of the innermost part, which is 4. So, that becomes $1 + 3(4)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, now I have 13.\n\nMoving out another level, the next expression is $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, where the something is now 13. So, that's $1 + 3(13)$. Calculating that: 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, now I have 40.\n\nContinuing this pattern, the next part is again $1 + 3(\\text{something})$, with the something being 40. So, that's $1 + 3(40)$. Let's compute: 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, now we're at 121.\n\nNext level out, it's $1 + 3(121)$. Calculating: 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, 364 is the result here.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have $1 + 3(364)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, now we're at 1093.\n\nContinuing outward, the next expression is $1 + 3(1093)$. Calculating that: 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, 3280 is the result here.\n\nNext, we have $1 + 3(3280)$. Let me figure that out: 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, now it's 9841.\n\nMoving out another level, the expression is $1 + 3(9841)$. Let me compute: 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, 29524 is the result here.\n\nNow, the next part is $1 + 3(29524)$. Let's calculate that: 3 times 29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. So, now we're at 88573.\n\nContinuing outward, the expression is $1 + 3(88573)$. Calculating: 3 times 88573 is 265719, plus 1 is 265720. So, 265720 is the result here.\n\nNext, we have $1 + 3(265720)$. Let me compute that: 3 times 265720 is 797160, plus 1 is 797161. So, now it's 797161.\n\nMoving out to the outermost layer, the expression is $1 + 3(797161)$. Let me figure that out: 3 times 797161 is 2391483, plus 1 is 2391484. So, 2391484 is the result here.\n\nFinally, the entire original expression is 3 times this result. So, we have 3 times 2391484. Let me compute that: 3 times 2,000,000 is 6,000,000. 3 times 391,484 is... Wait, maybe it's easier to just multiply 2391484 by 3 directly.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n2391484\n\u00d7        3\n----------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24, plus 1 is 25, write down 5, carry over 2.\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, plus 2 is 14, write down 4, carry over 1.\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3, plus 1 is 4, write down 4.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9, plus 2 is 11, write down 1, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 7,174,452.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits.\n\nWait, 2391484 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n2,000,000 \u00d7 3 = 6,000,000\n391,484 \u00d7 3 = ?\n\nWait, maybe I should do it step by step:\n\n2,391,484 \u00d7 3:\n\n2,000,000 \u00d7 3 = 6,000,000\n300,000 \u00d7 3 = 900,000\n90,000 \u00d7 3 = 270,000\n1,000 \u00d7 3 = 3,000\n400 \u00d7 3 = 1,200\n80 \u00d7 3 = 240\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together:\n\n6,000,000\n+ 900,000 = 6,900,000\n+ 270,000 = 7,170,000\n+ 3,000 = 7,173,000\n+ 1,200 = 7,174,200\n+ 240 = 7,174,440\n+ 12 = 7,174,452\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 3 times 2,391,484 is 7,174,452.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was multiplying step by step, I think I made a mistake in the placement. Let me try again:\n\n2391484 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24, plus 1 is 25. Write down 5, carry over 2.\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, plus 2 is 14. Write down 4, carry over 1.\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3, plus 1 is 4. Write down 4, carry over 0.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9, plus 2 is 11. Write down 1, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 7,174,452. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo, the final result is 7,174,452.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because when I was computing the innermost parts, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me recount the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, how many layers are there? Let's count the opening parentheses: each \"1+\" starts a new layer. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nEach time, another layer. Let me see, how many times does \"1+3\" appear? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nFrom the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...):\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, each time, we compute from the innermost out, 9 times.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I only went through 9 layers and ended up with 2,391,484, which when multiplied by 3 gives 7,174,452.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Let me recount each step:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720\n12. Next: 1 + 3*265720 = 1 + 797160 = 797161\n13. Next: 1 + 3*797161 = 1 + 2391483 = 2391484\n\nWait, hold on, I think I miscounted the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is one layer, and each subsequent layer wraps another 1+3 around it.\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nSo, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). Therefore, when I computed up to 2391484, that was after 9 layers, and then I multiplied by 3 to get the final result.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 13 steps, which might have been incorrect because I was counting each multiplication as a step, but actually, each layer is a step.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nEach \"1+3(...)\" is one layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, that's only 9 layers, so after layer 9, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this result, so 3*29524.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier calculation where I had 2391484. So, I must have miscounted the layers earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-express the original problem:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I had a much larger number. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers.\n\nWait, let me count the number of \"1+\" in the expression. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+\"s:\n\nStarting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n3. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n4. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n5. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n6. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n7. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n8. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n9. Inside that: 1+3(...))\n\nWait, so from the outermost 3(1+3(...)), each \"1+\" is one layer, and there are 9 \"1+\"s, meaning 9 layers inside. So, when I compute 9 layers, I get 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut in my initial calculation, I went further, up to 2391484, which seems incorrect because I had 9 layers, not more.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me check the expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first \"3(\":\n\nEach \"1+\" is followed by an opening parenthesis, except the last one.\n\nWait, let me write it out:\n\n3(\n1+\n3(\n1+\n3(\n1+\n3(\n1+\n3(\n1+\n3(\n1+\n3(\n1+\n3(\n1+\n3(\n1+\n3\n))))\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to count the number of \"1+\" expressions.\n\nEach \"1+\" is at a deeper level. So, starting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then, inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n3. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n4. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n5. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n6. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n7. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n8. Inside that: 1+3(1+3(...))\n9. Inside that: 1+3(...))\n\nSo, there are 9 instances of \"1+3(...)\", each nested inside the previous one.\n\nSo, each time, we compute from the innermost out, 9 times.\n\nSo, let's compute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 layers, we get 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times this result: 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 29524*3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from bottom to top: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carry 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed up to 2391484, I must have miscounted the layers. It seems that the correct number of layers is 9, leading to 88572 as the final result.\n\nWait, let me confirm this by another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.\n\nI recall that expressions of the form $a + b(a + b(a + b(...)))$ can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas.\n\nIn this case, each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}$. So, if I denote each layer as $L_n$, where $n$ is the layer number, starting from the innermost as $L_1$, then:\n\n$L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4$\n\n$L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n\n$L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40$\n\nAnd so on, up to $L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 = 29524$\n\nThen, the total expression is 3 \u00d7 $L_9$ = 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me see.\n\nThe general form is $L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}$, with $L_1 = 4$.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving $L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 1$.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous part is $L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0$, which has the characteristic equation $r - 3 = 0$, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is $C \\times 3^n$.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say $L_p = A$.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: $A - 3A = 1$ \u2192 $-2A = 1$ \u2192 $A = -1/2$.\n\nThus, the general solution is $L_n = C \\times 3^n - 1/2$.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, $L_1 = 4$.\n\nSo, $4 = C \\times 3^1 - 1/2$ \u2192 $4 = 3C - 1/2$ \u2192 $3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2$ \u2192 $C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2$.\n\nThus, the solution is $L_n = (3/2) \\times 3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2$.\n\nTherefore, $L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2$.\n\nSo, for n=9, $L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524$, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3 \u00d7 $L_9$ = 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms that the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I had a much larger number, 7,174,452, but that must have been a miscalculation due to miscounting the layers.\n\nSo, to ensure clarity, the correct result is 88572.\n\nBut let me just go through the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the step-by-step computation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think earlier when I thought I had 7,174,452, I must have miscounted the layers and continued beyond the 9th layer, which was incorrect. So, sticking to the correct number of layers, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula I derived, $L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2$, for n=9, we get 29524, and then 3 times that is 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{previous layer}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost part outward, we find that after 9 layers, the value is 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Use this result in the next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer up to the ninth layer, resulting in 29,524.\n4. Multiply the ninth layer's result by 3: \\(3 \\times 29,524 = 88,572\\).\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3. It seems like a recursive kind of problem, where each inner expression is used in the outer one. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually makes sense with parentheses.\n\nSo, let's write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nI count how many times the pattern repeats. Let me see: starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then that's multiplied by 3 and added to 1, and so on. Hmm, maybe I can represent this as a sequence of operations.\n\nLet me try to denote each part as a step. Let's say:\n\nStart with the innermost: Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, Step 2: 1 + 3*(Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, but let me check: Each step is 1 + 3*(previous step). So, each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and then that becomes the next step.\n\nBut wait, the original problem has 9 sets of parentheses. Let me count them. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...))\n3. Then another, and so on until the 9th one.\n\nWait, actually, let me count how many times the innermost 1+3 occurs. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...)) where the ... is the first step\n3. Then another layer, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9? Let me check:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, after the initial 3, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first layer. Then, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, after the first 3, it's 1 + 3(...). So, the first layer is the innermost (1 + 3). Then each layer wraps around that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers? Because I see 9 sets of parentheses starting from the innermost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 8 layers. Let me see: Each time you go in, you have a new set of parentheses. So, the innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me try to write it down step by step.\n\nLet me start from the innermost and work my way out.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*(Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(Step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(Step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(Step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(Step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(Step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(Step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(...), so after computing the innermost part up to Step 9, we then multiply by 3.\n\nWait, no, actually, each step is part of the expression. Wait, maybe I miscounted the steps. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the first innermost parentheses.\n\nThen, each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so how many layers do we have?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs. From the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" before the first closing parenthesis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see that each time you have a new layer, you add another (1 + 3(...)), so the number of layers is equal to the number of times you have to go in before the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nWait, perhaps the expression has 9 layers? Because I see that the innermost is (1 + 3), and each time you go out, you add another layer.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time after the 3, it's (1 + 3(...)). Let me count how many times this happens.\n\nStarting from the initial 3, the first (1 + 3(...)) is the first layer, then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), etc., until the innermost (1 + 3).\n\nSo, the number of layers is equal to the number of times you have (1 + 3(...)) inside each other. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nEach time, the pattern is 3(1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another 3(...). Let me see:\n\nFrom the expression, after the initial 3, we have:\n\n(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, inside the first (1 + 3(...)), there's another (1 + 3(...)), and so on, 8 more times.\n\nWait, so starting from the initial 3, the first (1 + 3(...)) is the first layer, then inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), so how many layers in total?\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, you have 9 layers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just compute each step step by step.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me define each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost.\n\nS1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nS3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nS4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nS5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nS6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nS7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nS8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nS9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(...), so after computing S9, which is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*S9.\n\nWait, no, because S9 is the innermost, and each step is building up the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and so on, until the outermost layer is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, if I compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, then each step is the next layer out.\n\nSo, let me try that again.\n\nLet me define the innermost as step 1:\n\nStep 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, step 2: 1 + 3*(Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*(Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*(Step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*(Step 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*(Step 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*(Step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*(Step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*(Step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nWait, so after step 9, we have 29524, which is the value inside the outermost parentheses. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that.\n\nSo, the final result is 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3 * 29524.\n\nWell, 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, 29,524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7, carryover 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the number is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify with another method:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps. Let me recount the steps.\n\nWait, I had 9 steps, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous step). So, step 1 to step 9, each time the result is 1 + 3*previous.\n\nThen, after step 9, we have 29,524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many layers?\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" occurs.\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3). Then, each time we go out, it's another (1 + 3(...)). So, the number of layers is the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)).\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the initial 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which itself contains another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nEach time, the pattern is 3(1 + 3(...)), so each layer adds another 3(...).\n\nSo, how many times does \"3(\" occur after the initial 3?\n\nLet me count:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. ...3(1 + 3(...\n3. ...3(1 + 3(...\n4. ...3(1 + 3(...\n5. ...3(1 + 3(...\n6. ...3(1 + 3(...\n7. ...3(1 + 3(...\n8. ...3(1 + 3(...\n9. ...3(1 + 3)))\n\nSo, I think there are 8 layers where \"3(\" occurs after the initial 3, meaning that the innermost is the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each \"3(\" corresponds to a step. So, the initial 3 is the outermost, then each \"3(\" inside is a new step.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just stick with my initial calculation where I had 9 steps, each time computing 1 + 3*previous, leading to step 9 being 29,524, then multiplying by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again to make sure.\n\nLet me recompute each step:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this, so 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check that again: 29,524 * 3.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of expression.\n\nI notice that each step is of the form S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for S_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is S_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nThe recurrence is S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: S_n - 3*S_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is S_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume S_n^p = K, a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u2192 K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is S_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApply the initial condition S_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is S_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: S_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: S_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: S_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nGood, the formula works.\n\nSo, for step n, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 steps, so n=9:\n\nS_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, S_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step follows logically, and the formula using the recurrence relation confirms the result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves computing the innermost expression and using that result in the next outer layer. By applying the recurrence relation and verifying with a closed-form formula, we find the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous term})\\), starting from the innermost \\(1 + 3\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1 (Innermost):** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{(result from Layer 9)}\\), so:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me see if I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a repeated pattern, so maybe I can work from the inside out. That usually works with nested expressions. Let me start from the innermost part and work my way outwards.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, each subsequent layer wraps another (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, it's like a chain of operations where each step depends on the previous one. Let me try to parse it layer by layer.\n\nStarting from the inside:\n\n1. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. So, 1 + 3 equals 4.\n\n2. Next layer out is (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). Since step 1 gave me 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13.\n\n3. Moving one layer out, the next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). So, that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40.\n\n4. Next, the following layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 3)). So, 1 + 3*40. Let me do that: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121.\n\n5. Then, the next one is (1 + 3*(result from step 4)). That would be 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364.\n\n6. Moving outward, the next layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 5)). So, 1 + 3*364. Let's compute that: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.\n\n7. Next, the expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 6)). That's 1 + 3*1093. Calculating that: 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280.\n\n8. The next layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 7)). So, 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute that: 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841.\n\n9. Then, the following layer is (1 + 3*(result from step 8)). That's 1 + 3*9841. Let's see: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524.\n\n10. Moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from step 9)). So, 1 + 3*29524. Calculating that: 3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573.\n\n11. The next expression is (1 + 3*(result from step 10)). That would be 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573: 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*73 is 219. Adding those up: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 219 is 265719. Then, adding 1 gives 265720.\n\n12. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(result from step 11). So, 3*265720. Let me compute that: 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. Adding them up: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to slip up with large numbers.\n\nStarting again from the inside:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\n10. (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573.\n\n11. (1 + 3*88573) = 1 + 265719 = 265720.\n\n12. Finally, 3*265720 = 797160.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Each step, I multiplied by 3 and added 1, working from the innermost parentheses outwards. So, each time, the number grows quite rapidly because of the multiplication by 3.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form (1 + 3*(previous)), it resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define each step as a term in a sequence. Let's say a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a\u2082 = 1 + 3*a\u2081 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nSimilarly, a\u2083 = 1 + 3*a\u2082 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to a\u2089, since there are nine layers of parentheses.\n\nWait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3) is the first layer.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)), so counting each opening parenthesis: there are nine opening parentheses before the final closing one. So, it's nine layers deep. So, a\u2081 to a\u2089.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089.\n\nSo, if I can find a formula for a\u2099, where a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, with a\u2081 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a\u2099 = A*3\u207f + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nUsing the recurrence relation:\n\na\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\nLet me substitute the general solution into the recurrence:\n\nA*3\u207f + B = 1 + 3*(A*3\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + B).\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3\u207f\u207b\u00b9 + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3\u207f + 3B.\n\nNow, set both sides equal:\n\nA*3\u207f + B = 1 + A*3\u207f + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3\u207f from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1.\n\nSo, B = -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a\u2081=4.\n\nSo, a\u2081 = A*3\u00b9 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolve for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na\u2099 = (3/2)*3\u207f - 1/2 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9)/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u2099 = (3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a\u2089 = (3\u00b9\u2070 - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3\u00b9\u2070: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a\u2089 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed step by step, a\u2089 was 29524, which matches. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, hold on, that's conflicting with my previous step-by-step calculation where I ended up with 797160. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n\n2. (1+3(...))\n\nEach time, there's an opening parenthesis before 1+3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the final closing one.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nCounting the opening parentheses after the initial 3(:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n\nSo, the first ( is for the innermost (1+3).\n\nThen, each layer adds another ( before 1+3.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 9 layers because each \"1+3(\" adds a layer.\n\nWait, let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n- After the first 3(, there's \"1+3(\", which is the first layer.\n\nThen, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer.\n\nLet me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2. 3(1+3(1+3(\n3. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n4. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n5. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n6. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n7. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n8. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n9. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers of \"1+3(\".\n\nBut when I computed step by step earlier, I went up to step 12, which included 11 layers, but perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, let's clarify: the original expression is 3 multiplied by a sum that has 9 layers of (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, in my initial step-by-step computation, I computed 9 layers, ending up with a\u2089=29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut when I did the step-by-step before, I went all the way to step 12, which actually would be 11 layers, which is incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers.\n\nWait, let me recount the layers properly.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me write it out:\n\nLayer 1: (1+3)\n\nLayer 2: (1+3(Layer1))\n\nLayer 3: (1+3(Layer2))\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: (1+3(Layer8))\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9).\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside the final multiplication by 3.\n\nTherefore, in my step-by-step earlier, I computed up to step 12, which was actually 11 layers, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify again.\n\nWait, no, the original expression is 3 multiplied by a sum that has 9 layers of (1+3(...)). So, the innermost is layer 1: (1+3). Then, each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so layer 2 is (1+3*(layer1)), and so on, up to layer9.\n\nTherefore, the total number of layers inside the final 3*(...) is 9.\n\nSo, when I computed step-by-step earlier, I went up to step 12, but that was incorrect because the expression only has 9 layers inside the final 3*(...).\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4.\n\n2. (1 + 3*4) = 13.\n\n3. (1 + 3*13) = 40.\n\n4. (1 + 3*40) = 121.\n\n5. (1 + 3*121) = 364.\n\n6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093.\n\n7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280.\n\n8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841.\n\n9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's 9 layers inside the final 3*(...), which is correct. So, my initial step-by-step computation was correct up to step 9, giving me a\u2089=29524, and then the final step is 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut earlier, I continued to step 12, which was incorrect because the original expression doesn't have that many layers. So, I think I made a mistake in the initial step-by-step by going beyond 9 layers.\n\nTherefore, the correct value is 88572.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I used the formula, I got a\u2089=(3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nBut in my initial step-by-step, I went up to step 12, which was 3*265720=797160, which was incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers. So, I think I confused the number of layers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify this again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n(1+3)=4.\n\nThen, each layer is (1 + 3*previous).\n\nSo, layer1:4\n\nlayer2:1 + 3*4=13\n\nlayer3:1 + 3*13=40\n\nlayer4:1 + 3*40=121\n\nlayer5:1 + 3*121=364\n\nlayer6:1 + 3*364=1093\n\nlayer7:1 + 3*1093=3280\n\nlayer8:1 + 3*3280=9841\n\nlayer9:1 + 3*9841=29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think earlier I miscounted the layers and went beyond, leading to confusion. So, the correct approach is to compute 9 layers inside the final 3*(...), giving 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a\u2099=(3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 -1)/2, so a\u2089=(3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check with n=9.\n\nYes, because the innermost is (1+3)=4, which is a\u2081=4, then a\u2082=13, up to a\u2089=29524.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*a\u2089=88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think earlier, when I did the step-by-step up to step 12, I was mistakenly adding more layers than actually present in the original problem.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- The expression has 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)) inside the final multiplication by 3.\n\n- Each layer is computed as a\u2099 = 1 + 3*a\u2099\u208b\u2081, starting from a\u2081=4.\n\n- After computing up to a\u2089=29524, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it step by step again, this time only going up to 9 layers.\n\n1. a\u2081 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. a\u2082 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\n3. a\u2083 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\n4. a\u2084 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\n5. a\u2085 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\n6. a\u2086 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\n7. a\u2087 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\n8. a\u2088 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\n9. a\u2089 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a\u2089 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers, but now I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is a term in a geometric series. The formula I derived earlier, a\u2099=(3\u207f\u207a\u00b9 -1)/2, gives the nth term, which for n=9 is (3\u00b9\u2070 -1)/2=29524. Multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression with ratio 3, starting from 4, and each subsequent term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But since I already have the formula, I can rely on that.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Start with the innermost expression: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Each subsequent layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(result from the previous layer)}\\).\n3. After computing all nine layers, the result is \\(29,524\\).\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n2. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n3. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n4. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n5. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n6. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n7. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n8. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n9. Next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n10. Finally, multiply by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me see how I can tackle this.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3. It seems like each layer is of the form 3*(1 + something). So maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another 3 multiplied by that result. So the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So let me clarify:\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So after the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, the next layer would be 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that.\n\nSecond layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, but let me count the number of layers to make sure I didn't miss any or add extra. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1+3. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n3. 3*(1 + 3*(...))\n...\nUp to 9 layers.\n\nSo I think I have 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So let me recount each layer step by step, writing down each result to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me list each layer from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9):\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nWait, so according to this, the final result is 36,084. Hmm, that seems pretty large, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Wait, 1 + 147 is 148, and 3*148 is 444. Yes, that's correct. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 1 + 444 is 445, and 3*445 is 1335. Correct. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. 1 + 1335 is 1336, and 3*1336 is 4008. Correct. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 1 + 4008 is 4009, and 3*4009 is 12027. Correct. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. 1 + 12027 is 12028, and 3*12028 is 36084. Correct. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo each step checks out. Therefore, the final result should be 36,084. Hmm, that seems right, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the expression: Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so it's like a repeated multiplication. If I denote each layer as a term, I can see if there's a pattern or formula to compute it without expanding each layer.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n represents the value after n layers. So:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo that's the same as before. So using this sequence approach, I still get 36,084 as the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express this recursively. The recursive formula is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since it's a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\na_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})\n\nLet me expand this:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is:\n\na_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is:\n\na_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 3 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3*K = 3\n\n-2*K = 3\n\nK = -3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 3/2\n\n4 = 3*C - 1.5\n\nAdding 1.5 to both sides:\n\n5.5 = 3*C\n\nC = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2\n\nSimplify this:\n\n(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}\n\nSo,\n\na_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2\n\nWe can factor out 1/2:\n\na_n = (1/2)*(11*3^{n-1} - 3)\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as:\n\na_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (8)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\na_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\na_3 = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGood, so the formula works for the first few terms. Therefore, for n=9, the value should be:\n\na_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2\n\nCompute 3^8:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2\n\nCompute 11*6561:\n\nLet me compute 10*6561 = 65,610\n\nThen add 6561: 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171\n\nSo,\n\na_9 = (72,171 - 3)/2 = 72,168 / 2 = 36,084\n\nWhich matches the result I got earlier by expanding each layer step by step. So that's reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36,084.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try another approach, maybe using the formula for a geometric series.\n\nLooking back at the original expression, it's a series of multiplications and additions. Each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). If I think about it, each layer is contributing a term in a geometric progression.\n\nLet me try to represent the entire expression as a sum.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So if I denote the innermost as a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3 + 3*a_1, and so on.\n\nWait, that's similar to the recursive formula I had before. So perhaps the sum can be represented as:\n\na_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nWhich is the same as the recurrence relation I solved earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's expand the expression step by step, writing out each multiplication.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n(1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, moving out:\n\n3*(1 + 4) = 3*1 + 3*4 = 3 + 12\n\nThen, moving out another layer:\n\n3*(1 + (3 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*1 + 3*15 = 3 + 45\n\nWait, but actually, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous), so each layer adds another term.\n\nWait, perhaps if I expand all the layers, I can express the entire expression as a sum.\n\nLet me try expanding the entire expression step by step, writing each multiplication:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*1 + 3*4 = 3 + 12\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + (3 + 12)) = 3*1 + 3*3 + 3*12 = 3 + 9 + 36\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + (3 + 9 + 36)) = 3*1 + 3*3 + 3*9 + 3*36 = 3 + 9 + 27 + 108\n\nWait, I see a pattern here. Each layer adds another term, each term being 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, for Layer n, the expression would be 3*(1 + sum of previous terms). So, if I continue expanding, I can see that the total expression is a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me try to write out the entire expression after all layers are expanded.\n\nStarting from Layer 1 to Layer 9:\n\nLayer 1: 4 = 3^1 + 1\n\nWait, no, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 3 + 1.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*1 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 3 + 3*4\n\nBut 4 is from Layer1, which is 1 + 3.\n\nSo Layer2: 3*(1 + (1 + 3)) = 3*1 + 3*1 + 3*3 = 3 + 3 + 9\n\nWait, that's 6 + 9 = 15.\n\nLayer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*1 + 3*15 = 3 + 45 = 48\n\nBut 15 is 3*(1 + 4), which is 3 + 12.\n\nSo Layer3: 3*(1 + (3 + 12)) = 3*1 + 3*3 + 3*12 = 3 + 9 + 36 = 48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*1 + 3*48 = 3 + 144 = 147\n\nBut 48 is 3*(1 + 15), which is 3 + 45.\n\nSo Layer4: 3*(1 + (3 + 45)) = 3*1 + 3*3 + 3*45 = 3 + 9 + 135 = 147\n\nWait, I'm seeing that each layer adds another term which is 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, if I keep expanding, the total expression after 9 layers would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me see.\n\nWait, no, because each layer is 3*(1 + ...), which introduces a 3 and then multiplies the inner expression by 3 again.\n\nWait, let me try to represent the entire expression as a sum.\n\nIf I denote the entire expression as E, then:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...))\n\nEach time, it's 3*(1 + something). So if I expand E, it would be:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*(3*1) + 3*(3*(3*1)) + ... up to 9 terms.\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me try expanding step by step.\n\nLet me write E as:\n\nE = 3*(1 + E1), where E1 is the next layer.\n\nSimilarly, E1 = 3*(1 + E2), and so on until E8 = 3*(1 + 3).\n\nSo, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)))\n\nSo, if I expand E, it becomes:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*3*1 + 3*3*3*1 + ... + 3*3*3*...*3*1\n\nWait, how many terms are there? Since there are 9 layers, each introducing a multiplication by 3, so the number of terms would be 9, each being 3^k for k from 1 to 9.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLayer 1: 3*1\n\nLayer 2: 3*3*1\n\nLayer 3: 3*3*3*1\n\n...\n\nLayer 9: 3^9*1\n\nSo, E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the entire expression E is the sum of a geometric series from k=1 to k=9 of 3^k.\n\nSo, E = sum_{k=1}^9 3^k\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is given by S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nHere, a = 3, r = 3, n = 9.\n\nSo,\n\nS = 3*(3^9 - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3*(19683 - 1)/2 = 3*(19682)/2 = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nWait, that's different from the 36,084 I got earlier. Hmm, that can't be right. There must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, because in the expansion, each layer is 3*(1 + previous), which introduces a 3 and then multiplies the inner expression by 3. So maybe the total sum isn't exactly the sum from k=1 to 9 of 3^k, because each layer is 3*(1 + ...), which includes a 3*1 and then 3*previous.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when I expand E = 3*(1 + E1), where E1 is 3*(1 + E2), and so on, until E8 = 3*(1 + 3).\n\nSo, if I expand E, it's:\n\nE = 3*1 + 3*E1\n\nBut E1 = 3*1 + 3*E2\n\nSo, E = 3*1 + 3*(3*1 + 3*E2) = 3 + 9 + 9*E2\n\nSimilarly, E2 = 3*1 + 3*E3, so E = 3 + 9 + 9*(3 + 3*E3) = 3 + 9 + 27 + 27*E3\n\nContinuing this way, each time, we add another term which is 3^{k} and then multiply the inner expression by 3^{k}.\n\nWait, so perhaps the total sum is not just sum_{k=1}^9 3^k, but includes more terms.\n\nWait, let me try to compute E using the expansion approach:\n\nE = 3*(1 + E1)\n\nE1 = 3*(1 + E2)\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + E3)\n\n...\n\nE8 = 3*(1 + 3)\n\nSo, E8 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12\n\nE7 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39\n\nE6 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120\n\nE5 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363\n\nE4 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092\n\nE3 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279\n\nE2 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840\n\nE1 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523\n\nE = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that's a different result altogether. But earlier, when I computed each layer step by step, I got 36,084. Now, using this expansion, I'm getting 88,572. Something is wrong here.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the layers. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I had 9 layers, starting from the innermost as Layer1, up to Layer9 being the outermost. But in this expansion, I started from E8 as the innermost, which would be Layer1, and E as Layer9. So perhaps the number of layers is 9, but in this expansion, I went from E8 up to E, which is 9 layers, but the result is 88,572, which contradicts the earlier result.\n\nWait, that can't be. There must be a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, let me go back to the initial step-by-step computation where I got 36,084. Let me recount:\n\nLayer1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer2: 3*(1+4)=15\n\nLayer3: 3*(1+15)=48\n\nLayer4: 3*(1+48)=147\n\nLayer5: 3*(1+147)=444\n\nLayer6: 3*(1+444)=1335\n\nLayer7: 3*(1+1335)=4008\n\nLayer8: 3*(1+4008)=12027\n\nLayer9: 3*(1+12027)=36084\n\nThat seems consistent. So when I used the recursive formula, I got 36,084.\n\nBut when I tried to expand E as a sum, I got 88,572, which is way off. So I must have made a mistake in that approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from how I'm defining the layers. Let me check.\n\nIn the initial approach, I considered the innermost (1+3) as Layer1, then each subsequent layer wraps around it with 3*(1 + ...). So Layer2 is 3*(1 + Layer1), Layer3 is 3*(1 + Layer2), etc., up to Layer9.\n\nIn the expansion approach, I started from E8 as the innermost, which is 3*(1 +3)=12, then E7=3*(1 + E8)=3*(13)=39, and so on, up to E=3*(1 + E1)=3*(1 + 29523)=88,572.\n\nBut that's inconsistent with the initial approach. So I must have misapplied the layers in the expansion.\n\nWait, no, in the initial approach, Layer1 is (1+3)=4, Layer2 is 3*(1+4)=15, etc., up to Layer9=36,084.\n\nIn the expansion approach, I defined E8 as the innermost, which would correspond to Layer1 in the initial approach. So E8=12, which is 3*(1+3)=12, which is Layer2 in the initial approach. Wait, that's where the confusion is.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, Layer1 is (1+3)=4, which is just the innermost parentheses. Then Layer2 is 3*(1+4)=15, which includes the next set of parentheses. So in the expansion approach, E8 corresponds to Layer2, not Layer1. So the layers don't align.\n\nTherefore, the expansion approach I did earlier was incorrect because I misaligned the layers. Instead, I should have started with E1 as the innermost (1+3)=4, then E2=3*(1 + E1)=15, etc., up to E9=36,084.\n\nSo, perhaps I should try expanding it correctly, starting from E1=4, then E2=3*(1 + E1)=15, and so on, which would give me the same result as the initial approach.\n\nWait, but when I tried expanding E as the sum, I got a different result. So perhaps the sum approach isn't directly applicable here.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The expression is a finite nested multiplication, so perhaps it's better to stick with the step-by-step computation or the recursive formula, which both give 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but adjusted correctly.\n\nWait, in the initial step-by-step approach, each layer is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a1=4.\n\nWe found a closed-form solution as a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nFor n=9, that gives a_9 = (11*3^8 - 3)/2 = (11*6561 -3)/2 = (72171 -3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084.\n\nSo that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 36,084.\n\nI think the confusion came when I tried to model it as a sum of 3^k terms, but that approach was flawed because the structure of the expression isn't a simple sum of powers of 3. Instead, each layer is a multiplication by 3 of (1 + previous layer), leading to the recursive formula and the closed-form solution we derived.\n\nTherefore, after carefully checking each step and verifying through different methods, I'm confident that the final answer is 36,084.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 3 times (1 plus the result of the next inner layer). By systematically computing each layer step by step, we arrive at the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n\n9. **Outermost Layer (Layer 9):**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a nested set of terms, each of which is 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). It looks like a recursive structure, where each level depends on the one inside it. So, maybe the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nLet me write down the expression to visualize it better. The innermost part is (1+3). Then, moving outwards, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, starting from the inside:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3)\n2. Next layer: 3 * (1 + result from step 1)\n3. Next: 3 * (1 + result from step 2)\n4. And so on, until we get to the outermost layer.\n\nSince there are multiple layers, I should probably compute each step one by one, keeping track of each result as I go. Let me count how many layers there are. Looking at the original expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nI can see that each opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Starting from the left:\n\n1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n2. Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on.\n\nWait, actually, each time it's 3*(1 + ...), so each \"3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial one to see how many layers there are. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then another 3 inside\n3. Continuing until the last 3(1+3)\n\nI think there are nine layers here because each \"3(\" is a new layer, and the innermost one is just (1+3). Wait, no, maybe it's eight layers because each 3 corresponds to a layer, and the innermost is (1+3), which doesn't have a 3 multiplying it. Let me check:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3\n2. Then, the next 3 inside\n3. Then another 3, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, each time it's 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s. Let me see: starting from the first 3, then each inner 3 is a new layer. So, how many 3s are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, it's 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3, and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3\n2. Then another 3 inside\n3. Another 3, and so on.\n\nWait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. The first opening parenthesis after the first 3: that's the start of the first inner expression.\n2. Then, inside that, another opening parenthesis: that's the second layer.\n3. Continuing this way, how many opening parentheses are there?\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is one opening parenthesis. Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), which is another opening parenthesis, and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3), which is the ninth opening parenthesis. Wait, let me count:\n\nStarting from the first 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another (1 + 3(...))\n3. So, each time, a new opening parenthesis.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by the first opening parenthesis.\n- Then, inside that, another opening parenthesis, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, the number of opening parentheses is equal to the number of layers. Let me see: the expression is 3 followed by 8 more opening parentheses, because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the ninth layer? Wait, no, maybe it's eight layers because each 3 corresponds to a layer, and the innermost is just (1 + 3), which is the ninth layer? Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think of it as each \"3(\" is a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"3(\" appears. Let me look again:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial one:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then another 3 inside\n3. Continuing until the innermost 3(1 + 3)\n\nWait, no, actually, the innermost part is just (1 + 3), without a 3 multiplying it. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s, which is eight, because starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is a new layer, and the innermost is just (1 + 3), which is the ninth term, but not multiplied by 3. Hmm, I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe it's better to just start computing from the innermost part and work my way out, regardless of how many layers there are. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3). That's straightforward:\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have 3 multiplied by (1 + result from the innermost layer). So, the next layer is:\n\n3 * (1 + 4) = 3 * 5 = 15\n\nOkay, so the second layer gives us 15.\n\nMoving out another layer, we have another 3 multiplied by (1 + the previous result). So, next:\n\n3 * (1 + 15) = 3 * 16 = 48\n\nThird layer: 48\n\nNext layer:\n\n3 * (1 + 48) = 3 * 49 = 147\n\nFourth layer: 147\n\nContinuing:\n\n3 * (1 + 147) = 3 * 148 = 444\n\nFifth layer: 444\n\nNext:\n\n3 * (1 + 444) = 3 * 445 = 1335\n\nSixth layer: 1335\n\nNext:\n\n3 * (1 + 1335) = 3 * 1336 = 4008\n\nSeventh layer: 4008\n\nContinuing:\n\n3 * (1 + 4008) = 3 * 4009 = 12027\n\nEighth layer: 12027\n\nNext:\n\n3 * (1 + 12027) = 3 * 12028 = 36084\n\nNinth layer: 36084\n\nWait, but in the original expression, how many layers did we have? Let me check again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial one:\n\n1. The first 3 is the outermost layer.\n2. Then, inside that, another 3: that's the second layer.\n3. Then another 3: third layer.\n4. Continuing until the innermost 3.\n\nWait, how many 3s are there in total? Let me count:\n\n- The first 3 is outside all the parentheses.\n- Then, each time we have a 3 inside another layer.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first 3, there are eight more 3s inside the parentheses. So, that makes nine layers in total? Wait, no, because the first 3 is the outermost, and each inner 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the outermost:\n\n1. 3(1 + ...)\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nSo, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is a new layer. The innermost part is (1 + 3), which is the ninth layer? Wait, no, because the first 3 is layer 1, then each inner 3 is layers 2 through 9? Hmm, perhaps.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of times we have to compute 3*(1 + ...). Let me see.\n\nWhen I started computing, I did:\n\n1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4\n2. Then 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. Then 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. Then 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. Then 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. Then 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. Then 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. Then 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. Then 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as layer 1, and each subsequent layer adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, the outermost layer is the ninth one, which is 36084.\n\nBut let me check the original expression again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3 is the outermost.\n2. Then, inside that, another 3: that's the second layer.\n3. Then another 3: third layer.\n4. Continuing until the innermost 3.\n\nSo, how many 3s are there? Let me count:\n\n- The first 3 is the outermost.\n- Then, each time, a new 3 inside: so, the number of 3s is equal to the number of layers.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost 3(1 + 3)\n\nSo, how many 3s are there? Let me see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of 3s:\n\n1. The first 3\n2. Then, another 3 inside\n3. Another 3, and so on, until the innermost 3.\n\nWait, I think there are eight 3s after the first one, making it nine layers in total. Wait, no, because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is just two numbers, not a 3 multiplied by something. So, perhaps the number of layers is eight.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should just proceed with the computation as I did before, starting from the innermost and working out, and see what the result is.\n\nSo, as I computed earlier, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, after nine layers, the result is 36084. But wait, in the original expression, how many layers do we have? Let me see again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"3(\" is a new layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\":\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...))\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n3. And so on, until the innermost.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3), which doesn't have a 3 multiplying it. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...))\n- Then, inside that, another 3(1 + ...)\n- So, each \"3(\" is a new layer.\n\nLet me count the number of \"3(\":\n\n1. The first 3(\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\":\n\n1. The first 3(\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(\n3. Then another 3(\n4. Continuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, I think there are eight \"3(\" after the first one, making it nine layers in total. Because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is just two terms, not a 3 multiplied by something. So, perhaps the number of layers is eight.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I had nine layers, starting from (1 + 3) as layer 1, and each subsequent layer adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, maybe the confusion is about whether the innermost (1 + 3) is considered layer 1 or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of each \"3(\" as a new layer, so the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\" in the expression. Let me count:\n\n- The first 3( is layer 1\n- Then, inside that, another 3( is layer 2\n- And so on, until the innermost 3( is layer 8\n\nWait, because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is just two terms, not a 3( something. So, the number of \"3(\" is eight, meaning eight layers.\n\nWait, but in my computation earlier, I had nine layers because I started counting from (1 + 3) as layer 1, and then each 3*(1 + ...) as layers 2 through 9.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the innermost (1 + 3) is considered a layer or not. If we consider each \"3(\" as a layer, then there are eight layers. So, let's see:\n\nIf there are eight layers, then my computation earlier went one layer too far. So, let me adjust.\n\nStarting from the innermost (1 + 3) as layer 1:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 (layer 2)\n3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48 (layer 3)\n4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147 (layer 4)\n5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444 (layer 5)\n6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 (layer 6)\n7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 (layer 7)\n8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 (layer 8)\n\nSo, after eight layers, the result is 12027. Then, the outermost layer would be 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nWait, but if there are eight layers of \"3(\", then the outermost layer is the ninth computation. Hmm, perhaps the number of layers is nine, with the innermost being layer 1 and the outermost being layer 9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of layers is equal to the number of \"3(\" in the expression. Let me count again:\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of \"3(\":\n\n1. The first 3(\n2. Then, inside that, another 3(\n3. Then another 3(\n4. Continuing until the innermost.\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is not preceded by a 3(. So, the number of \"3(\" is eight, meaning eight layers.\n\nTherefore, my computation should stop at layer 8, which is 12027, and then the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.\n\nWait, but in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), where ... is the result of the inner expression. So, if the inner expression evaluates to 12027, then the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 36084.\n\nBut let me double-check this by working through the layers step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n\nNow, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 36084.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually computing each layer, but given that there are only eight layers, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether there's a mathematical pattern here. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 3*(1 + a_n).\n\nSo, recursively, a_{n+1} = 3*(1 + a_n), with a_1 = 4.\n\nThen, we can compute up to a_9, since there are nine layers.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there were eight layers, but perhaps it's nine. Let me see:\n\nIf a_1 = 4 (innermost), then a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15\n\na_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48\n\na_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147\n\na_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444\n\na_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335\n\na_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008\n\na_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027\n\na_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084\n\nSo, a_9 is the result of the outermost layer, which is 36084.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 36084.\n\nI think that's correct. To be thorough, let me compute each step again:\n\n1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15\n3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48\n4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147\n5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444\n6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335\n7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008\n8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027\n9. Outermost: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, the result is 36084.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and each step follows logically from the previous one. So, I'm confident that 36084 is the correct result for the given expression.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Substitute this result into the next layer:\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12027\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3(1 + 12027) = 3 \\times 12028 = 36084\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final result is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{36084}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that this is a nested expression, meaning each part inside the parentheses depends on the result of the inner expression. So, to solve this, I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That makes sense because otherwise, I might get lost in the layers.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.\n\nInnermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, we have another expression: 1 + 3*(result from innermost layer). Wait, let me check. The next layer is 1 + 3*(innermost result). So, after computing the innermost as 4, the next layer would be 1 + 3*4.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nOkay, so now the next layer out is 1 + 3*(13). Let me compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nHmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, I'm taking the result from the inner layer, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. Let me try to see if this continues consistently.\n\nSo, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40. Let's calculate that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nWait, so each step is: result = 1 + 3*(previous result). That seems to be the case. So, let me try to formalize this.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a step. Let's say we have n layers, each time we compute a new result based on the previous one. Starting from the innermost, which is step 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from 4, each subsequent step is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me list these steps:\n\n1. Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Step 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me count the number of layers. The original problem is: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 +\" is followed by a 3 times another parentheses. Let me count how many opening parentheses there are after the first 3.\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, the pattern is 3(1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 3 is multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to count how many layers there are. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each step adds another layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"3(\" introduces a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3( introduces a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...\n\nSo, that's 9 layers, right? Because after the first 3, there are 9 more 3(, each adding a layer. Wait, but when I started counting earlier, I went up to step 10. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, the number of times we have 3 times ( is equal to the number of layers. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3( is another layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers after the initial 3. Wait, but when I started computing earlier, I had 10 steps. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Each time I compute a layer, I'm going one step out. So, the innermost is step 1, then step 2, up to step 9, because there are 9 layers after the initial 3. So, perhaps I went one step too far earlier.\n\nLet me recount:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, after 9 steps, the innermost expression is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that result, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + ... )). So, the outermost 3 is multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, after computing the innermost 9 layers, we have a value, say V, and then the total expression is 3*V.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify the structure.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, each time adding a new 1 + 3*(...). So, after 9 layers, we have a value, and then the outermost 3 multiplies that.\n\nWait, but when I was computing earlier, I thought the outermost 3 is part of the expression. So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, and then the final result is 3 times that.\n\nWait, let me see. Let me try to parse the expression.\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the innermost is layer 1: 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 times that result, so 3*29524.\n\nWait, but hold on, is that correct? Because the outermost expression is 3*(layer 9 result). So, after computing layer 9, which is 29524, we have to multiply that by 3 to get the final result.\n\nSo, 3*29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nWait, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nSo, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was computing step by step, I had:\n\nStep 1: 4\n\nStep 2: 13\n\nStep 3: 40\n\nStep 4: 121\n\nStep 5: 364\n\nStep 6: 1093\n\nStep 7: 3280\n\nStep 8: 9841\n\nStep 9: 29524\n\nThen, total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, when I first started, I thought there were 10 layers, but now I'm seeing 9 layers and then the outermost 3. So, perhaps the total expression is 88572.\n\nBut let me verify this because I might have miscounted the number of layers.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: \n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer. Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\":\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each time we have \"1 + 3(\", so:\n\n1. (1 + 3)\n2. (1 + 3(...\n3. (1 + 3(...\n4. (1 + 3(...\n5. (1 + 3(...\n6. (1 + 3(...\n7. (1 + 3(...\n8. (1 + 3(...\n9. (1 + 3(...))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers of \"1 + 3(...)\", and then the outermost 3 multiplies the result.\n\nTherefore, after computing 9 layers, we have 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I was computing step by step, I went up to step 10, which gave me 88573. That seems inconsistent. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nSo, step 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 29524*3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I thought I had 10 steps, I got 88573. That must have been a miscalculation. So, the correct result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check step 9 again. Step 9: 1 + 3*9841.\n\n3*9841: Let's compute that.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n800*3 = 2400\n\n40*3 = 120\n\n1*3 = 3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523.\n\nSo, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me try to compute the expression in a different way. Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the nested expression, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^(p) = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, which is the number of layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute the expression step by step, layer by layer, as I did earlier, and arrive at the same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until we reach the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\n1. Innermost layer: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\).\n2. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\).\n3. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\).\n4. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\).\n5. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\).\n6. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\).\n7. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\).\n8. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\).\n9. Next layer: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\).\n\nFinally, multiply by 3: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me try to write each step down, starting from the innermost.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost.\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(L9). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, we multiply it by 3.\n\nSo, the total result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that multiplication again because I might have made a mistake in breaking it down.\n\nAlternatively, 3*29524: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 8 7 7 5 7 2. Wait, that's 877572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is 88572, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation. Let me try again.\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 7 7 5 7 2, which is 877572. Wait, that's conflicting with my initial thought of 88572. Hmm, I must have messed up the place values.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying by 3:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 8 (ten thousands place), 7 (thousands), 8 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 7 (units), 2 (units). Wait, that's 878572? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, 29524 \u00d73:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the units place:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing the digits from right to left: 2 (units), 7 (tens), 5 (hundreds), 8 (thousands), 7 (ten thousands), 8 (hundred thousands). Wait, that's 878572.\n\nWait, but that can't be because 30,000 \u00d73 is 90,000, so 29,524 \u00d73 should be a bit less than 90,000, which is 88,572. So, 87,8572? Wait, maybe I'm confused with the place values.\n\nWait, 29524 is 29,524.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nCompute 20,000 \u00d73 = 60,000.\n\n9,000 \u00d73=27,000.\n\n500\u00d73=1,500.\n\n20\u00d73=60.\n\n4\u00d73=12.\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000.\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500.\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560.\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29,524 \u00d73 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps where I computed each layer. Maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nSo, starting from L1:\n\nL1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13.\n\nL3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nL4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nL6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nL7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nL8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nL9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nWait, actually, a_1 is (1+3)=4, then a_2=1+3*a_1=1+12=13, a_3=1+3*a_2=1+39=40, etc.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n to avoid computing each term step by step.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C =1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A \u2192 9/2 = 3A \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from L1 to L9.\n\nWait, but let me check: L1 corresponds to n=1, L2 to n=2, up to L9 which would be n=9.\n\nSo, L9 = a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the innermost expression L9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nStarting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I expand it, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, it's like 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... up to a certain number of terms, but each term is multiplied by 3 in the outer layers.\n\nWait, but in this case, since each layer is 1 + 3*(inner), it's more of a nested structure rather than a simple geometric series.\n\nWait, perhaps I can represent the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the expression step by step again, just to make sure.\n\nCompute L1: 1+3=4.\n\nL2:1 +3*4=1+12=13.\n\nL3:1 +3*13=1+39=40.\n\nL4:1 +3*40=1+120=121.\n\nL5:1 +3*121=1+363=364.\n\nL6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093.\n\nL7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280.\n\nL8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841.\n\nL9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula we derived earlier: a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2= (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I've checked it multiple ways: step-by-step computation, using the recurrence relation, and deriving a closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation.

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a recursive kind of pattern, maybe? So perhaps I can work from the innermost parentheses outwards. That usually makes sense with nested expressions.\n\nLet me rewrite the expression to see it more clearly:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\nSo, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   (1 + 3) = 4\n\nNow, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 times that result plus 1. Wait, no, let me check: the next level is 1 + 3*(result). So, let me compute each level step by step.\n\nLet me label each level for clarity. Let's say each opening parenthesis is a level, so starting from the innermost:\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nFinally, the outermost part is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + ...). So each level is 1 + 3*(previous level), except the very outermost is just 3*(...). Let me make sure I'm counting the levels correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check the original expression again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost (1+3). So, let's count how many 3*(1 + ...) there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen, each level is 3*(previous result + 1). Wait, no: each level is 1 + 3*(inner result). Let me try to count the number of times this happens.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outwards, computing each level as I go.\n\nLet me try again, step by step, writing down each computation.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses:\n\n1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call this Level 1.\n\n2. Next, moving one level out: (1 + 3*(Level 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Level 2.\n\n3. Next level out: (1 + 3*(Level 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Level 3.\n\n4. Next: (1 + 3*(Level 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Level 4.\n\n5. Next: (1 + 3*(Level 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Level 5.\n\n6. Next: (1 + 3*(Level 5)) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Level 6.\n\n7. Next: (1 + 3*(Level 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Level 7.\n\n8. Next: (1 + 3*(Level 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Level 8.\n\n9. Next: (1 + 3*(Level 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Level 9.\n\nNow, after that, the outermost part is 3*(Level 9). So:\n\n10. Compute 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = ?\n\nWait, so that would be the final result. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let me compute 3*29524.\n\n3*29524: Let's compute this step by step.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 (carry) = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nLet me compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 + 2 = 17 \u2192 7, carryover 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 \u2192 7, carryover 2.\n\n(There's no more digits, so bring down the carryover 2.)\n\nSo putting it all together, we get 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d7 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000\n\n9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier levels. Let me go through each level again to check.\n\nLevel 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct.\n\nLevel 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLevel 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLevel 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLevel 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLevel 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLevel 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLevel 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLevel 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3\u00d729524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Sometimes these problems can be solved using geometric series or other formulas.\n\nLooking at the structure, each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then each next level is (1 + 3*previous_level). So starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc.\n\nSo this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for a_n, which might help in computing higher levels without computing each step.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and has the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c = 1 and r = 3.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^{n} - 1) + (a_1 - c/(r - 1))*r^{n-1}\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for linear recurrences.\n\nThe general solution for a recurrence relation a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = (a_1 + c/(r - 1)) * r^{n-1} - c/(r - 1)\n\nWait, let me verify that.\n\nWait, actually, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*r^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant if c is a constant.\n\nSo, assuming a particular solution a_p = K, then substituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = r*K + c \u21d2 K - r*K = c \u21d2 K*(1 - r) = c \u21d2 K = c/(1 - r)\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = a_p + a_h = c/(1 - r) + A*r^{n}\n\nApplying initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = c/(1 - r) + A*r^{1}\n\nWe have c = 1, r = 3, so:\n\n4 = 1/(1 - 3) + A*3 \u21d2 4 = 1/(-2) + 3A \u21d2 4 = -1/2 + 3A \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\na_n = (1)/(1 - 3) + (3/2)*3^{n} = (-1/2) + (3/2)*3^{n}\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (-1/2) + (3^{n+1})/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier results:\n\nFor n=1, a_1 should be 4.\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = 13.\n\n(3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = 40.\n\n(3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=121.\n\n(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 levels of nesting, so the innermost is level 1, and the outermost is level 9.\n\nWait, but let me check: starting from the innermost (1+3) as level 1, then each subsequent level adds another 3*(...). So, how many levels do we have?\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a level. So, the innermost is level 1, and the outermost is level 9.\n\nThus, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, because a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the outermost 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we can compute the result without going through each level, which is more efficient, especially if the number of levels were larger.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again to confirm:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the problem is solved correctly.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by computing the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[ (1 + 3) = 4 \\]\n\n2. Next level out:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\]\n\n3. Next level out:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\]\n\n4. Next level out:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\]\n\n5.

Next level out:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\]\n\n8. Next level out:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\]\n\n9. Next level out:\n   \\[ 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\]\n\nFinally, compute the outermost part:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each multiplied by 3. It seems like each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions.\n\nSo, the innermost part is 1+3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving out one layer, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). Let me write this down step by step to keep track.\n\nLet me label each layer from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 to 9, maybe. So, starting from the inside:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2: 3(1 + result from Layer 1). So that would be 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that: 1 + 4 is 5, then 3*5 is 15.\n\nLayer 3: Now, moving out another layer, it's 3*(1 + result from Layer 2). So, 3*(1 + 15). 1 + 15 is 16, then 3*16 is 48.\n\nLayer 4: Next, 3*(1 + result from Layer 3). So, 3*(1 + 48). 1 + 48 is 49, then 3*49 is 147.\n\nLayer 5: Then, 3*(1 + 147). 1 + 147 is 148, so 3*148. Hmm, 148 times 3. Let me compute that: 100*3 is 300, 40*3 is 120, 8*3 is 24. So, 300 + 120 is 420, plus 24 is 444. So, 3*148 is 444.\n\nLayer 6: Now, 3*(1 + 444). 1 + 444 is 445, so 3*445. Let me calculate that: 400*3 is 1200, 40*3 is 120, 5*3 is 15. Adding them up: 1200 + 120 is 1320, plus 15 is 1335. So, Layer 6 gives 1335.\n\nLayer 7: Next, 3*(1 + 1335). 1 + 1335 is 1336. Then, 3*1336. Hmm, let's break that down: 1000*3 is 3000, 300*3 is 900, 30*3 is 90, 6*3 is 18. Adding them together: 3000 + 900 is 3900, plus 90 is 3990, plus 18 is 4008. So, Layer 7 is 4008.\n\nLayer 8: Moving out another layer, it's 3*(1 + 4008). 1 + 4008 is 4009. Then, 3*4009. Let me compute that: 4000*3 is 12,000, 9*3 is 27. So, 12,000 + 27 is 12,027. So, Layer 8 is 12,027.\n\nLayer 9: Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 12,027). 1 + 12,027 is 12,028. Then, 3*12,028. Let me compute this carefully: 10,000*3 is 30,000, 2,000*3 is 6,000, 28*3 is 84. Adding them up: 30,000 + 6,000 is 36,000, plus 84 is 36,084.\n\nWait a second, let me verify that calculation because 12,028 times 3. Maybe I should compute it digit by digit to be sure.\n\n12,028\n\u00d7        3\n__________\nLet's multiply each digit:\n\n8 \u00d7 3 = 24, write down 4, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8.\n0 \u00d7 3 = 0.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6.\n1 \u00d7 3 = 3.\n\nSo, writing it out: 36,084. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer gives us the next number, and the final result after all layers is 36,084.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each step again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.\n\nLayer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.\n\nLayer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.\n\nLayer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.\n\nLayer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.\n\nLayer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.\n\nLayer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12,027.\n\nLayer 9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028 = 36,084.\n\nYes, each step seems correct. I think I did this right. So, the final answer should be 36,084.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize to make it faster, but since it's only nine layers, doing each step manually isn't too bad. But just to explore, let's see if there's a pattern or formula.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's of the form 3*(1 + previous result). So, each layer is 3*(1 + R), where R is the result from the previous layer.\n\nLet me see if I can model this recursively. Let's denote each result as R_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1.\n\nSo, R_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nR_2 = 3*(1 + R_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nR_3 = 3*(1 + R_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nAnd so on, up to R_9.\n\nSo, in general, R_n = 3*(1 + R_{n-1}).\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for R_n.\n\nLet me try to compute a few terms to see if I can find a pattern.\n\nR_1 = 4.\n\nR_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15.\n\nR_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48.\n\nR_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147.\n\nR_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444.\n\nR_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335.\n\nR_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008.\n\nR_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12,027.\n\nR_9 = 3*(1 + 12,027) = 36,084.\n\nHmm, so each R_n is 3 times (1 + R_{n-1}).\n\nThis seems like a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general form is R_n = 3*R_{n-1} + 3.\n\nWait, because R_n = 3*(1 + R_{n-1}) = 3*1 + 3*R_{n-1} = 3 + 3*R_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the recurrence is R_n = 3*R_{n-1} + 3, with R_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: R_n - 3*R_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is R_h = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution R_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 3 => -2*C = 3 => C = -3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is R_n = R_h + R_p = A*3^n - 3/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, R_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5.\n\nAdding 1.5 to both sides: 5.5 = 3A => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6.\n\nThus, the general solution is R_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.\n\nSimplify that: (11/6)*3^n is the same as (11*3^{n})/6, which simplifies to (11*3^{n-1})/2.\n\nSo, R_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1.\n\nR_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct.\n\nn=3: (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct.\n\nn=4: (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Wait, no, 11*81 is 891? Wait, 3^4 is 81, so 11*81 is 891, minus 3 is 888, divided by 2 is 444. Yes, correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed R_4, I got 147, but according to this formula, R_4 would be 444. Wait, no, wait, maybe I messed up the n values.\n\nWait, hold on, when I started, R_1 was the innermost, which was 4. Then R_2 was 15, R_3 was 48, R_4 was 147, R_5 was 444, etc.\n\nWait, so in the formula, R_n corresponds to the nth layer, starting from n=1 as 4, n=2 as 15, etc. So, when n=9, R_9 should be 36,084.\n\nLet me compute R_9 using the formula: R_9 = (11*3^{9-1} - 3)/2 = (11*6561 - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 11*6561: 10*6561=65,610; 1*6561=6,561. So, 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171. Then subtract 3: 72,171 - 3 = 72,168. Then divide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084. Perfect, that's the same as before.\n\nSo, using the formula, R_9 = 36,084, which matches the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 36,084.\n\nI think that's solid. Both methods give the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute the result step by step. Additionally, recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allows us to derive a closed-form formula, confirming the result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Start with the innermost parentheses:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Work outward, applying the multiplication by 3 each time:**\n   - Layer 2: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4) = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(3 \\times (1 + 15) = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(3 \\times (1 + 48) = 3 \\times 49 = 147\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(3 \\times (1 + 147) = 3 \\times 148 = 444\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(3 \\times (1 + 444) = 3 \\times 445 = 1335\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(3 \\times (1 + 1335) = 3 \\times 1336 = 4008\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(3 \\times (1 + 4008) = 3 \\times 4009 = 12,027\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(3 \\times (1 + 12,027) = 3 \\times 12,028 = 36,084\\)\n\n3. **Verification using a recurrence relation:**\n   - The expression fits the recurrence \\(R_n = 3R_{n-1} + 3\\) with \\(R_1 = 4\\).\n   - Solving this gives a closed-form formula \\(R_n = \\frac{11 \\times 3^{n-1} - 3}{2}\\).\n   - For \\(n = 9\\), \\(R_9 = \\frac{11 \\times 3^8 - 3}{2} = 36,084\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{36084}"
