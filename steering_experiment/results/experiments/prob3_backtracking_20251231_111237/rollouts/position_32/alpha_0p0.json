    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524 Let me calculate that. 3 * 29524: Let me break it down. 3 * 20000 = 60000 3 * 9000 = 27000 3 * 500 = 1500 3 * 24 = 72 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, right. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, yes. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, that's correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, yes. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, yes. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, that's right. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3 again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I did it right. Alternatively, I could compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3. Let me do it step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n-------\nFirst, multiply 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. Write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. Write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, same as before. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...). Each time, I see a (1 + 3(...)), so how many times does this happen? Let me see:\n\nStarting with 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \u2192 1\n2. Then inside that, another 1+3(\u2026 \u2192 2\n3. Continuing, each time it's another layer.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me recount. Let me see the structure:\n\nThe expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me see how many layers there are. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), so each layer is a multiplication by 3 and addition of 1.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Let me think about it.\n\nEach layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, so a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., which is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nSo, the number of layers is 9, because from the innermost (1+3) as a_1, then up to a_9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, but when I computed, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nBut let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nLooking at the original expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(\n2. 1+3(\n3. 1+3(\n4. 1+3(\n5. 1+3(\n6. 1+3(\n7. 1+3(\n8. 1+3(\n9. 1+3(\n\nSo, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning that there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that. So, my initial calculation from a_1 to a_9 is correct.\n\nThus, the final result is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any arithmetic errors in computing a_9. Let me recalculate each layer:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that's correct. Each step seems accurate. So, a_9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2 with a carryover of 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5 with a carryover of 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8 with a carryover of 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it down: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time helped prevent errors.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer, we compute each subsequent layer until reaching the outermost one, then multiply the result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next nested term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute from Innermost Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, let's compute that: Final result: 3 * 29524 = Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the final result should be 88,572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an error. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, +12=1092. So, Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 88,572 is the result. Wait, but let me think again\u2014this seems like a very large number, and I'm not sure if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is the first 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, I think I counted them correctly from Layer 1 to Layer 9. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: Each \"1+\" starts a new layer, and there are nine such layers before the final multiplication by 3. So, yes, Layer 9 is the outermost one, and then we multiply by 3. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using the method for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me plug in the initial condition to find D. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + D = 3C + D. To find another equation, let's compute a_2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = C*3^2 + D = 9C + D. So, we have two equations: 3C + D = 4 and 9C + D = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9C + D) - (3C + D) = 13 - 4 => 6C = 9 => C = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute C back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + D = 4 => 9/2 + D = 4 => D = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's verify this formula with the values we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for our problem, we need a_9, because the expression is 3*a_9. Let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, using the formula, we can compute it directly without going through each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But for nine layers, step-by-step isn't too bad. I just have to be careful with each multiplication and addition to avoid arithmetic errors. So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a formula derived from a linear recurrence relation. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. **Derive the Formula**: The recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be solved to find a general term:\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Compute the Outermost Layer**: For the 9th layer (n=9):\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Wait, no. Let me check the original expression again. The problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the left, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (another expression)). So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no. Let me count the layers properly. Let me see: Each time I have a 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), etc., up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, but when I counted earlier, I went up to Layer 9 as 1 + 3*(Layer 8), which would be the innermost part. But actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so maybe the innermost Layer 1 is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so the total number of layers is 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, because the first term is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer 9, which is the innermost, the next layer would be 1 + 3*(Layer 9), but wait, no, because I think I miscounted. Let me try again. Let me think of the expression as having 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and working outward. So, Layer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then (1+3(...)), and each time there's a (1+3(...) inside. Let me count the number of times 1+3 occurs. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) \n\nEach time after a 3, there's a (1+3(...)). So, starting from the first 3, then the first (1+3(...)), which contains another (1+3(...)), and so on. Let me count how many times 1+3 is nested. Let me see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...)), which is Layer 1.\n- Inside that, another (1+3(...)) which is Layer 2.\n- Continuing, up to Layer 9, which is the innermost 1+3.\n\nWait, so that means the innermost Layer 1 is 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, when I compute up to Layer 9, that's the innermost part, and then the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, 3*29524 is 88572. But let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524.

Yep, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. If I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 And so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1, and we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, the value inside the outermost parentheses is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} =177147. Then, (177147 - 3)/2 = (177144)/2 =88,572. Which matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value inside the outermost parentheses is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication: 29524 * 3. I can break it down as follows: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recompute each layer just to be sure. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Now, 29524 * 3: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can recognize, which would allow me to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me write that down: a_1 = 4 a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n \u2265 2. So, this is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it's correct. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 =4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for the entire expression. Let me think: The entire expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2. So, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, that's the same answer. So, another way to compute it is by recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Each a_n is part of a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. So, the sum can be expressed as (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, without having to compute each layer, I can jump to the final formula. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step and verify that the formula holds, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^{11} to confirm: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Correct. So, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)=177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. So, everything checks out.

So, the result is 88572. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using a formula for geometric series or something like that? Because each layer seems to be multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which reminds me of a geometric progression. Let me consider that. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 40, and so on. So, each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: a1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0, perhaps? Wait, but n starts at 1. Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition at n=1: a1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, no. Let me count again. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer) +1. So, the outermost layer is layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a9), where a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute a9: 3^{10} = 59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to think about it, like expanding the entire expression, but that would be very tedious given the number of layers. The recursive approach seems efficient. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is defined recursively.

Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me think about that approach as a way to verify. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. To find C, we can set a_n = C, so C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Using the initial condition, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, for n=9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = 59,049/2 - 1/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.

That seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the final value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. It's easy to miscount or miscalculate when there are so many layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3 * 29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nI think I did each step correctly. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and then adding 1. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3 times the prior plus 1. It's a geometric progression of sorts, but since each term is built on the previous, it's more of a recursive computation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. If I have an expression like 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. But in this case, it's nested, so each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps it's a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n layers, the value would be a_n.\n\nGiven that, let's compute a few terms:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, a_9 = 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, is there a closed-form formula for a_n? Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is straightforward, but since it's nonhomogeneous, we can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nTo find C, set a_n = C, so C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches our earlier computation. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, the expression is (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSame result. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I went through each layer step by step, verified each computation, and even derived a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of multiplication and addition. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer and substitute it into the next. Using a recurrence relation approach, we derive a formula to compute the value efficiently. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. The expression is a geometric series, perhaps? Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me try to model it as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*A - 1/2 => 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. Okay, so the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since our expression has 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^{10} = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized that the expression is a geometric series and used the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Let me explore that approach as well. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). If I think of this as a geometric series, each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to express it in terms of a geometric series. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2. The next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. Continuing this pattern, each layer adds another term with 3 raised to the next power. So, for layer n, the expression would be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. Wait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to building up the sum step by step. So, actually, each layer is a partial sum of a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous one, starting from 1. The sum of a geometric series is given by S_n = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1), where r is the common ratio. In our case, r = 3, so S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. Therefore, the value of each layer is indeed the sum of a geometric series up to that layer. So, for layer 9, the sum is S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. This method also confirms the result. It's interesting how the problem can be approached both by iteratively computing each layer and by recognizing it as a geometric series and applying the sum formula. Either way, the answer comes out the same. I think I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct result. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or check the number of layers again. Let me count the number of opening parentheses in the original expression: Starting from the left, each set of parentheses adds one more layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Counting the opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) There are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer, so 9 layers in total. Therefore, our earlier calculation using layer 9 is correct. So, I think I've verified it sufficiently. The answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the outermost layer is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or something, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Wait, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4. So, when n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one before multiplying by 3, n=9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result I got by computing each layer step by step. Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly. Since the expression is 3*(a_9)=3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with 88,572.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 1*3=3; 4*3=12, carryover 1; 8*3=24 +1=25, carryover 2; 9*3=27 +2=29. So, 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3 again. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. Correct. Okay, so each step checks out. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value at each step and substitute it into the next layer. Finally, multiplying the outermost result by 3 gives the solution.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Still correct.) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Yes.) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Right.) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct.) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Yes.) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Good.) Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. That seems right. Wait, but when I added 29,524 * 3, I think I might have made a mistake in the breakdown. Let me check that again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding these: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 60 = 88,560 88,560 + 12 = 88,572 Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Perhaps there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 ... And so on, up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time. Let's see if this sequence follows a particular pattern. Let me list out the a_n values: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 13 a_3 = 40 a_4 = 121 a_5 = 364 a_6 = 1093 a_7 = 3280 a_8 = 9841 a_9 = 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers, I wonder if there's a recurrence relation or a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is clearly a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution and the particular solution. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Okay, so the formula seems to work. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms the result using a different method. Alternatively, I could also think of this expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression might lead to a geometric series. Let me try to write out the entire expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121 Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} where n is the layer number. Wait, let me check: For Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2. Wait, that's the same as the formula we had before. For Layer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = 27 - 1 = 26 / 2 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, in general, each a_n is the sum of a geometric series: a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or recognize it as a geometric series, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Wait, no. Let me check the original expression again. It starts with 3*(...), so the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. But when I numbered the layers, I started from the innermost as Layer 1, and each subsequent layer added another 3*(previous layer). So, the outermost layer would be Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me recount. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, and working outwards. So, perhaps my earlier approach was correct, computing each layer up to Layer 9, and then multiplying by 3. Wait, but when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. But let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Well, 29524 * 3. Let me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check the multiplication again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the layer calculations. Let me verify each layer once more.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check the original expression again. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...). Let's count how many times 1 + 3(...) appears.\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n10. 1 + 3)\n11. )...\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me see: Each time, after the initial 3, there's a (1 + 3(...). So, how many times does 1 + 3(...) occur? Let me write it out:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nCounting the number of (1 + 3(...): Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is the 9th one: (1 + 3). Then each layer wraps around that. So, my earlier computation up to Layer 9 is correct, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that when I computed Layer 9, I included the outermost 3 multiplication. Wait no, in my initial approach, I computed each layer, starting from the innermost, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9), which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the multiplication. Let me compute 29524 * 3 again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write down 7, carry over 0.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15 \u2192 write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone, especially for more layers. Let me think about this.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 =4, and each subsequent layer is a_{n} =1 +3*a_{n-1}, up to Layer9, which would be a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}.\n\n3^1=3\n3^2=9\n3^3=27\n3^4=81\n3^5=243\n3^6=729\n3^7=2187\n3^8=6561\n3^9=19683\n3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the formula. The formula gives a_n as (3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10}-1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as 3*(a_9), which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute the result without having to compute each layer manually, which is much more efficient, especially if there are more layers.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, which gave me Layer9=29524.\n\n3. Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 29524*3=88572.\n\n4. Alternatively, use the recurrence relation formula to find a_n and then compute 3*a_9, which also gave me 88572.\n\nBoth methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Computation:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Each step checks out, so I think the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after computing Layer 9 as 29524, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern? Let me consider that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, it seems to work. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, both methods confirm that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct). Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more step. So, I think I did nine layers, which is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation might give me a closed-form expression. Let me see. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the equation: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final result is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think I did everything correctly, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to see if it matches. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: L_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: L_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: L_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: L_9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, yes, the formula works, and each layer is correctly calculated. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. I think that's solid. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is just 3^{n} - something, but in this case, using the recurrence was helpful. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but let me verify one more time. Let me compute 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a recurrence relation, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we find that the value of the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute that. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carry over 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, I arrive at the final result of 88,572. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have simplified this. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1 + 3, each time we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That actually resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recursive sequence. Maybe there's a formula for such a sequence. Let me consider the general form: Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition to find B. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Now, let's find another condition. Let's compute a_2 using the formula: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the closed-form: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (from n=1) and 9A + B = 13 (from n=2). Let's subtract the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. Simplifying that: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88,572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula to compute a_9 directly without calculating each layer step by step. That might have saved some time, especially if the expression had more layers. But since there were only nine layers, it wasn't too bad to compute each one sequentially. It's interesting how recognizing the recurrence relation can lead to a more efficient solution. I guess practice helps in seeing these patterns more quickly. Anyway, I feel confident now that the answer is correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula gave me the same result. So, I think I'm good to go.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses inside each other, starting from the innermost. Let me count them again: Starting from the innermost: (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)), so total layers are nine. So, Layer 1 is innermost, Layer 9 is outermost, and then we multiply by 3. So, yes, 3*(Layer 9) gives us 88,572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. The expression is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series, but each term is being multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Wait, but in each layer, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, actually, a_1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=2, a_2 = 13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plug A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this for n=1: (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

So, the final computation would be: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3 = (20000 * 3) + (9000 * 3) + (500 * 3) + (24 * 3) = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 72 = Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. So, the total would be 88,572. Wait, let me check if I did that correctly. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it together: 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of them, which would throw off the entire calculation. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88,572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. So, the recurrence is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the recurrence into this form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If a_n = A*3^{n} + B, then substituting into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for the innermost layer being a_1, each subsequent layer a_n corresponds to n=1 up to n=9. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost expression is Layer 1: 1 +3, which is a_1=4. Then Layer 2 is a_2=13, and so on up to Layer 9. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Let me compute a_9 using the formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88,572. So, that confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm it's 59049. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So, 3^10 is indeed 59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88,572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost to the outermost.

Each layer's result is used correctly in the next layer. So, I think my calculations are correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. Let me try to see if there's a pattern or formula that could have saved me some time. Looking at each layer, it seems like each term is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Solving such a recurrence, we can find a closed-form expression. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(k-1)) * k^{n-1} - c/(k-1). Let's see if that applies here. In our case, k = 3 and c = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (4 + 1/(3-1)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(3-1) = (4 + 0.5) * 3^{n-1} - 0.5 = 4.5 * 3^{n-1} - 0.5. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = 4.5 * 3^{0} - 0.5 = 4.5*1 - 0.5 = 4.0 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. For n=2: a_2 = 4.5*3^{1} - 0.5 = 13.5 - 0.5 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=3: 4.5*9 - 0.5 = 40.5 - 0.5 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. n=4: 4.5*27 - 0.5 = 121.5 - 0.5 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, the value would be a_9 = 4.5 * 3^{8} - 0.5. Let me compute that: 3^8 is 6561. So, 4.5 * 6561 = (9/2)*6561 = (9*6561)/2. Let me compute 9*6561: 9*6000=54000, 9*561=5049, so total is 54000 + 5049 = 59049. Then, 59049 / 2 = 29524.5. Now, subtract 0.5: 29524.5 - 0.5 = 29524. So, a_9 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just write down the steps clearly for myself: 1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. 2. Each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). 3. Compute each layer step by step up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524. 4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer: 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit tedious computing each layer, but since the number of layers isn't too large, it's manageable. If there were more layers, maybe I would look for a formula or a pattern to generalize it, but for nine layers, step-by-step computation works fine.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's see. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation would be r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Correct, matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think this is correct, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each layer is a geometric series. Let me think: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I expand it all the way, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I let x be the innermost term, it's x = 1 + 3*x, which would give x = (1)/(1 - 3) if it's an infinite series, but in this case, it's finite, with nine layers. So, maybe the formula I derived earlier is more appropriate. Alternatively, since I know the formula for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524, as before. So, 3*29524=88,572.

So, adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but wait, let me check Layer 9 again because 3*9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. Then 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that can be generalized without computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for the nth layer. Let's define Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1, where L1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is Ln = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general formula is Ln = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Therefore, Ln = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: (3^(2) -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches L1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches L2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L9 = (3^(10) -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier and used the formula, but computing each layer step by step also worked.

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to multiply 3 by 29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that I can use to verify this without computing each layer manually. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model this. Let\u2019s denote the value of the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1 => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13, correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct. For n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct. For n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct. For n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct. For n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct. For n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct. So, the formula works for all the layers I computed. Therefore, the value at layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Alternatively, I could have used the formula to find a_9 directly without computing each layer. Let me try that approach as another verification. a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59,049. So, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, multiply by 3: 29,524 *3 =88,572. Yep, same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is correct. It's interesting how recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation allowed me to find a direct formula instead of computing each layer step by step. That might have been a more efficient way if the number of layers was larger, but for nine layers, both methods worked fine. I think I've got a good handle on this problem now. It was a bit intimidating at first because of the many nested parentheses, but breaking it down layer by layer and then looking for a pattern really helped. I wonder if there's a way to represent this expression using exponents or another mathematical concept to simplify it even more. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series? Let me think about that. The expression a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be thought of as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3. Specifically, it's like 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*1 + ... up to some number of terms. Wait, but in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which actually forms a geometric series. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, if I expand this recursively, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}*a_1. Since a_1 =4, which is 1 +3, this becomes a geometric series. So, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^{n}*a_1. Wait, no, actually, let me think again. When I expand a_n, it's 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Then, a_{n-1} is 1 + 3*a_{n-2}, so a_n =1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) =1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}. Similarly, a_{n-2}=1 +3*a_{n-3}, so a_n=1 +3 +3^2*(1 +3*a_{n-3})=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3*a_{n-3}. Continuing this way, after expanding n times, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^{n}*a_1. Since a_1=4, this becomes a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 4*3^{n}. The sum sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k is a geometric series with ratio 3, so it sums to (3^{n} -1)/(3 -1)= (3^{n} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2 +4*3^{n}= (3^{n} -1 +8*3^{n})/2= (9*3^{n} -1)/2= (3^{n+2} -1)/2. Wait, but earlier, we had a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Hmm, there seems to be a discrepancy here. Let me check my steps again. When expanding a_n, I get a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}=1 +3*(1 +3*a_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}=...=sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k +3^{n}*a_0. But wait, a_1=4, which is when n=1, so actually, a_1=1 +3*a_0. But a_0 isn't defined in our initial problem. Wait, maybe I messed up the indexing. Let me redefine it properly. Let\u2019s say that the innermost layer is a_1=1 +3=4. Then, a_2=1 +3*a_1, a_3=1 +3*a_2, etc., up to a_9. So, in this case, a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1} for n>=2, with a_1=4. So, when expanding a_n, it's a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}=1 +3*(1 +3*a_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}=...=sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k +3^{n}*a_1. Therefore, a_n=sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k +3^{n}*a_1. Since a_1=4, this becomes a_n=(3^{n} -1)/2 +4*3^{n}=(3^{n} -1 +8*3^{n})/2=(9*3^{n} -1)/2=(3^{2} *3^{n} -1)/2=(3^{n+2} -1)/2. Wait, but earlier, using the recurrence relation, we had a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, which one is correct? Let me check for n=1: Using the formula from the recurrence: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, correct. Using the expanded geometric series approach: a_1=(3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which is incorrect because a_1=4. So, the geometric series approach must have an error in indexing. Let me see: When n=1, a_1=4. But according to the expanded formula, a_n=(3^{n+2}-1)/2. For n=1, that gives (27-1)/2=13, which doesn't match. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the expansion. Let me try again. Starting from a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's express a_n in terms of a_1. a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}\na_{n-1}=1 +3*a_{n-2}\n...\na_2=1 +3*a_1\n\nSo, substituting backwards:\na_n=1 +3*(1 +3*a_{n-2})=1 +3 +3^2*a_{n-2}\n=1 +3 +3^2*(1 +3*a_{n-3})=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3*a_{n-3}\n...\nContinuing until we reach a_1:\na_n=1 +3 +3^2 +...+3^{n-1}*a_1\n\nTherefore, a_n= sum_{k=0}^{n-1}3^k +3^{n}*a_1\n\nWhich is a_n=(3^{n} -1)/2 +3^{n}*a_1\n\nBut a_1=4, so:\n\na_n=(3^{n} -1)/2 +4*3^{n}= (3^{n} -1 +8*3^{n})/2= (9*3^{n} -1)/2= (3^{2}*3^{n} -1)/2= (3^{n+2} -1)/2\n\nBut earlier, using the recurrence relation, we had a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. There's a conflict here. Let me check with n=1:\n\nFrom recurrence: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=4, correct.\n\nFrom the expanded formula: a_1=(3^{3}-1)/2=13, which is wrong.\n\nSo, the expanded formula is incorrect. Probably because when n=1, the sum_{k=0}^{0}3^k=1, and then +3^{1}*a_1=3*4=12, so total a_1=1+12=13, which contradicts a_1=4. Therefore, the mistake must be in the expansion. Wait, no, because a_1 is defined as 1 +3=4, but in the expansion for a_n, when n=1, it's supposed to be a_1=1 +3*a_0, but a_0 isn't defined. Therefore, perhaps the correct way is to adjust the formula to account for the starting point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the general solution a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 is correct, as verified by the initial computations, and the geometric series approach might have an off-by-one error or misindexing. Since the recurrence solution worked correctly for all layers, I think that's the accurate approach, and the discrepancy arises from the geometric series expansion not properly accounting for the initial condition. Therefore, I'll stick with the recurrence solution that gave me a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, which correctly gives a_1=4, a_2=13, etc.\n\nSo, in conclusion, using both the step-by-step layer computation and the recurrence relation formula, I arrived at the same result: the value of the innermost layer a_9 is 29,524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the two different methods gave the same result, which adds to my confidence. It was a bit time-consuming, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula really helped solidify the answer for me. I guess the key takeaway here is that recognizing patterns and being able to model them with recurrence relations or geometric series can save a lot of time, especially with more complex or nested expressions.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by breaking down the expression from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so the final result would be: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, maybe it's easier to just do straight multiplication. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, 29524 *3=88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the carry-over. Let me write it out:\n\n  29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify Layer 9 again. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Wait, that's different from what I had before. Oh no, I think I made a mistake in Layer 9.\n\nWait, Layer 8 is 9841. So, 3*9841 is 29523, right? Because 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. So, Layer 9 should be 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, that's correct because 29523 +1 is 29524. So, my earlier calculation was right. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of recursive expression.\n\nThis looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI wonder if there's a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's try to find a pattern or a formula.\n\nLet's compute a few more terms to see if a pattern emerges.\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, the sequence is: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nLooking at this, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nI think the solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a linear recurrence of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nAssume the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*(A*3^{n-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B\n\nRight side: A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSet them equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nSimplify:\n\nB - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier terms.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n3*20000=60000\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*500=1500\n\n3*20=60\n\n3*4=12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 is (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each layer step by step, derived a general formula for a_n, verified it with known terms, and then applied it to find a_9, and finally multiplied by 3 to get the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so I need to compute that: Final result: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me calculate that. 29524 multiplied by 3. I can do this step by step: 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct). Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (correct). Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (correct). Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (correct). Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (correct). Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (correct). Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (correct). Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, seems like all the steps check out. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer individually. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * (L_0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, so maybe I need to adjust the formula accordingly. Let me recall the formula for the nth term of a linear recurrence relation. For a recurrence like L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the closed-form solution is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). But in our case, L_1 = 4, so perhaps L_0 would be when n=0, which isn't given. Alternatively, maybe I can express it in terms of L_1. Let me try to compute the closed-form solution. Let me denote the number of layers as k. Here, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers, so k=9. So, starting from L_1 = 4, each subsequent layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on, up to L_9. So, the general formula for L_n is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found using the method of solving such equations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Next, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (b=1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form solution also gives me the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the closed-form solution for the recurrence, we determine the value of the innermost expression and propagate outward, ultimately multiplying by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(next term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? So, the outermost part is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3*29524 = Let me do the multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7. 2*3=6, write down 6. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because I think I might have made a mistake in the carry-over. Alternatively, maybe I should break it down differently. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Okay, so 3*29524 = 88572. So, the total value of the expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check because when I was multiplying 29524 by 3, I thought I might have made a mistake. Let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3: Let's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent because the number 29524 has only five digits, so let me correct that. Let's write it properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Okay, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the layers again because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that each opening parenthesis after the first 3 has a corresponding closing parenthesis, and each of those has another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. Then 1 + 3*(previous result)\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer, starting from the innermost. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))\n... and so on, until there are nine layers? Wait, no, let's see: Each time we have a \"1 + 3(...)\", so the number of layers is equal to the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let me count them:\n\nLooking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each preceding one adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first 3 is outside, then each opening parenthesis after that is a new layer. Let's count:\n\n- The first 3 is at the very beginning.\n- Then, each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count how many times \"1+3(\" appears:\n\n1. After the first 3: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost to the outermost, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nEach time we have a \"1+3(\", so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nContinuing until we have nine layers, because the expression has nine sets of parentheses. Wait, no, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, from the innermost, it's (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of layers by counting the number of \"1+3(\" instances. Let's see:\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is (1+3(...)), and inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on. So, how many times does \"1+3(\" occur?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" after the initial one adds a new layer. Let me count:\n\n- The first \"1+3(\" is the innermost.\n- Then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. The innermost is just (1+3), then each layer adds another set. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then each layer adds another (1+3(...)).\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, the layers are:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I had Layer 1 as 1+3=4, Layer 2 as 1+3*4=13, Layer 3 as 1+3*13=40, and so on up to Layer 9 being 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut let me confirm the number of layers. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The first 3 is outside, then each (1+3(...) is a new layer.\n\nSo, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9. Let me see:\n\n- The first 3 is followed by (1+3(...))\n- Inside that, another (1+3(...)), and so on, until there are 9 opening parentheses. Wait, no, because the innermost is just (1+3), so let's count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n...\nEach time, we add another layer. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of \"1+3(\" instances after the first 3: Each time you see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because each \"1+3(\" is inside the previous one, so the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me count:\n\nAfter the first 3, the expression is:\n\n(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" inside is a new layer. So, the first layer is (1+3(...)), the second is (1+3(...)), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as each \"1+3(\" adds a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" in the expression.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" is a new layer. So, starting from the first \"1+3(\" after the initial 3, each subsequent \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...1+3(...\n3. ...1+3(...\n4. ...1+3(...\n5. ...1+3(...\n6. ...1+3(...\n7. ...1+3(...\n8. ...1+3(...\n9. ...1+3(...\n\nWait, that's 9 \"1+3(\" instances, meaning 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and working outwards, each layer is built upon the previous one.\n\nWait, but when I computed earlier, I started with Layer 1 as the innermost (1+3)=4, then Layer 2 as 1+3*4=13, and so on up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the previous calculation.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. Since there are nine layers, each computed as above, and each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, yes, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. The general form is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for a recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = (a_1 + c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} - c/(1 - k), provided that k \u2260 1.\n\nIn this case, k = 3 and c = 1. So, the solution would be a_n = (4 + 1/(1 - 3)) * 3^{n-1} - 1/(1 - 3).\n\nSimplifying:\n\na_n = (4 - 1/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2\n\na_n = (7/2) * 3^{n-1} + 1/2\n\nBut let me check if this formula works with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (7/2)*3^{0} + 1/2 = (7/2)*1 + 1/2 = 7/2 + 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (7/2)*3^{1} + 1/2 = (7/2)*3 + 1/2 = 21/2 + 1/2 = 22/2 = 11. Wait, but earlier I had a_2 as 13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, perhaps my general formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me rederive the solution properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is when a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9, which is a_9, is (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation earlier.\n\nAlternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nThen, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nWhich matches the earlier result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the general formula, or compute it as 3^{11}/2 - 3/2, I get the same result: 88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, so: Total = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 Let me compute that. 3*29524: First, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093: Let me compute that again. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270+9=3279. Then, 3279 +1=3280. Correct.)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then +1=9841. Correct.)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then +1=29524. Correct.)\n\nNow, total is 3*29524. Let me compute that again. 29524*3:\n\nCompute 20000*3=60000\n9000*3=27000\n500*3=1500\n20*3=60\n4*3=12\n\nWait, I think I broke it down differently before, but let's do it properly.\n\n29524*3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8\nSo, reading from the top:\n29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think I did each step correctly, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have simplified this process instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1 = 1 + 3, L2 = 1 + 3*L1, L3 = 1 + 3*L2, and so on up to L9. This seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Maybe there's a closed-form formula for such a recurrence. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_{n} = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using a formula. In this case, each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which fits the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, where k=3 and c=1. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = (a_1 - c/(1 - k)) * k^{n-1} + c/(1 - k). Wait, but let me check that. Actually, the standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s. So, in this case, r=3, s=1. The solution is a_n = (a_1 - s/(1 - r)) * r^{n-1} + s/(1 - r). Wait, but in our case, r=3, which is greater than 1, so 1 - r is negative. Let me compute the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, whose solution is A*3^n. The particular solution is a constant, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1. So, P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, our first layer is L1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\nFor n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\nFor n=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\nn=9: (3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nWow, that formula works perfectly! So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used this formula to find L9 directly. L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572. This method is much faster, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since I was able to compute each layer manually without making a mistake, it's reassuring to see both methods lead to the same result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can recognize a pattern where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). \n\nWe can use the formula for such a recurrence relation, which gives each layer \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the innermost layer (n=1) to the outermost (n=9), we compute:\n\n- \\(L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
