Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me go back a bit. When I computed Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time I was computing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 7 again because 3*1,093 is 3,279, plus 1 is 3,280. That seems correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3,280 = 9,840, plus 1 is 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9,841 = 29,523, plus 1 is 29,524.\n\nThen, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if there's a pattern here that I can recognize, perhaps a geometric series or something that can be generalized, but since it's only nine layers, maybe computing each step is the most straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by setting a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => 0 = 1 + 2K => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, that formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute a few layers manually.\n\nStarting with a_1 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: 29,524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute this again:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7        3\n__________\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n9\u00d73=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but when I multiply 29,524 by 3, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial calculation because 29,524 \u00d7 3 is actually 88,572. Let me confirm with another method.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\n20,000 \u00d7 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 \u00d7 3 = 27,000 \u2192 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n500 \u00d7 3 = 1,500 \u2192 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n20 \u00d7 3 = 60 \u2192 88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time using the formula I derived earlier. The total expression is 3*(a_9) where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177,147.\n\nSo, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Perfect, that matches.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be represented as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Evaluating the outermost layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Compute the final expression**: Multiply Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, but let me verify this with another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result. So, the total is 88,572. Wait, but let me just double-check each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier on. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524=88572. So, all the layers check out correctly. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, especially in the earlier layers, let me recompute a couple more layers. Let's check Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40=120, so 1 + 120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121=363, so 1 + 363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364=1092, so 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. Correct. So, yes, each step seems accurate. Therefore, the total is indeed 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*Layer 9. Let's do that: 3 * 9841 = 29523 Wait, hold on a second. I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check my layers because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 1 + 3*Layer 8, which is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. But then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 would be 88572. Hmm, that doesn't match what I had before. Let me go back and check each layer to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524.

But earlier, I thought Layer 9 was 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572. So, the final result should be 88572.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because when I first computed Layer 9, I thought the expression was 3*(Layer 9), but actually, let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, yes, Layer 9 is 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculation for 29524*3. Let me compute it another way to confirm.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Layer 9 was 29524, which is correct because Layer 9 is 1 + 3*Layer8, where Layer8 is 9841. So, 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nI think I got confused earlier because I thought the outermost layer was Layer9, but actually, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer9). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nWait, let's test that. Let's assume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nBut L_n is also A*3^n + B. So,\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's say n=1: L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check it with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, this formula works! So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, the innermost layer is Layer1, which is n=1, and the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So, Layer9 corresponds to n=9.\n\nTherefore, Layer9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that:\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, Layer9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572, as I computed earlier.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, which is similar to each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. But in this case, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a bit different, but the recurrence approach worked well.\n\nI think I've verified it multiple times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524 Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let's compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic error somewhere. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recursive relation. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be written as L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The standard solution for such a linear recurrence relation is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let me make sure: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine 1+3(...) terms. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: L1=4, then layer 2: L2=13, and so on up to layer 9. So, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so each time we're adding 1 and then scaling by 3. If I expand the entire expression, it would be 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be seen as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3 each time. Let me try to write it out. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Alternatively, since each layer is similar, maybe I can express E in terms of itself, but I think that might get complicated because it's only nine layers deep, not infinitely. But perhaps I can see a pattern. Wait, but I already found a formula for L_n, so maybe that's sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the expression using the formula I found. Since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524, then E=3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I can think of the expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, which is 3*(L9). Since L9 is (3^{10} -1)/2, then E=3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which again confirms that the answer is 88572. Therefore, I think I can confidently say that the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, that would be 88572. But wait, 29524*3: Let me compute it another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So the total is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1+3). Then moving out, Layer 2: (1+3(...)), and so on, until Layer 9. Wait, actually, the expression is 3(1+3(...)), so the innermost is Layer 1: (1+3). Then Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1+3*(Layer 2), and so on until Layer 9, which is 1+3*(Layer 8). Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So I think I counted correctly, 9 layers. Let me list each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computation: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then total = 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me check Layer 8 again: Layer 7 was 3280, so Layer 8 is 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000+840=9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then total is 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about that. Let's define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1, a_1=4. For n=2, a_2=1 + 3*4=13, which matches what I did before. Similarly, a_3=1 + 3*13=40, etc. So, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if the formula holds. For n=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2=1, but a_1=4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, let's solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is linear and can be written as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = A. Substituting into the equation: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A =1 => A= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So that's consistent with both methods: computing step by step and using the recurrence relation formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Correct. So a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Yep, that seems right. So, I think I've got it. The final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Using the formula for such a recurrence, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find that the 9th layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually? Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model it. Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence is given by L_n = a^n * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, in our case, L_1 = 4, so maybe L_0 would be 1? Let me check. If n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0, so 4 = 1 + 3*L_0 => 3*L_0 = 3 => L_0 = 1. So, yes, L_0 = 1. Therefore, the general formula would be L_n = 3^n * L_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = 3^n * 1 + (3^n - 1)/2. Simplifying, L_n = 3^n + (3^n - 1)/2 = (2*3^n + 3^n - 1)/2 = (3*3^n - 1)/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2, L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3, L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this is correct. Let me just check once more for any calculation errors. When I computed 3*29524, I broke it down as 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000+27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. Correct. Alternatively, 29524*3: 29524*3. Let's compute 29524*3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524 again to be sure. 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Okay, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can represent this kind of nested expression. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about it. If I let x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, with x_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each layer is defined recursively. So, x_1 = 4, x_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, x_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to x_9. Then, the total expression is 3*x_9. So, if I can find a general formula for x_n, that might help verify my answer. The recurrence relation is x_n = 1 + 3x_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is x_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say x_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is x_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition x_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is x_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, x_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n = 9, x_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, x_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the result I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*x_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute 29,524 * 3 step by step: 29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 = Now adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572.

Let me count the number of innermost 1+3s. From the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me recount the layers properly. The innermost expression is 1+3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nWait, but when I look at the original expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, my calculation seems correct. Let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers.

Let me consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, each a_n can be expressed as a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I computed earlier for Layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of innermost 1+3 terms. Each time, the expression is 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3*(1+3)\n\nThen, 1+3*(1+3*(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, until we have nine layers. So, the number of layers is nine, which corresponds to n=9 in the general solution. So, a_9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the value using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute this using a different approach, such as recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the expression can be represented as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, plus 1.\n\nBut since each layer is built upon the previous one, it's more efficient to compute each layer step by step or use the formula I derived earlier.\n\nI think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, starting from a_1=4, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = c + k*a_{n-1} is a_n = c*(k^{n} -1)/(k-1) + a_0*(k^{n}) if I remember correctly. Wait, let me think again. The standard form is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + s, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. In this case, r=3, s=1. The solution is a_n = (s/(r-1))*(r^{n} -1) + a_0*r^{n}. Wait, but in our case, a_1=4, and each a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, starting from n=1, a_1=4. Then a_2=1 +3*4=13, a_3=1+3*13=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. So, the general solution for a_n where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1 is given by a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. To find B, set a_n = B, then B=3*B +1, so -2B=1, so B= -1/2. Then, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} -1/2. Now, using the initial condition, when n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10})/2 -1/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so 59049/2 -1/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches the earlier computation. So, a_9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations.

Okay, so that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable to compute each one. But just to check, maybe I can see if there's a pattern in the layers. Let's list the layers again: Layer 1: 4 Layer 2: 13 Layer 3: 40 Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 29524 Now, let's see if there's a pattern or a formula for each layer. Each layer n is defined as 1 + 3*(layer n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. That's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for the nth term. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=29524, which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(29524)=88572. Alternatively, since each layer is defined as a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, and the final expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Wait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. That's the same result as before. So, that's another way to compute it using the formula. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. To make sure, I'll go through the steps again quickly: Compute each layer from 1 to 9 using the recursive formula, which gives me a_9=29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then 3*a_9=88572. So, both methods confirm the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking down each layer from the innermost to the outermost and applying the recursive formula, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the closed-form formula for the nth term, we determine that the final result is 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might save time if I have to compute similar problems in the future. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, the nth layer is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think this makes sense. Alternatively, I can compute 3^{10} directly, which is 59049, and then use the formula. But since I already have the value, I think it's consistent. So, yeah, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression.

Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, after double-checking each layer, I'm confident that the computation is correct. Therefore, the result of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2.

Let me verify this with another approach to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps this is a geometric series or follows a pattern that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the alternative approach using recurrence relations gave me the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find each subsequent layer's value. Recognizing the pattern as a recurrence relation, we solve it using a general formula, confirming the result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841.

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure that I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)), right? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3(...), then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, inside the first 3(...), there's 1+3(...), and inside that, another 1+3(...), and so on, until the innermost is 1+3. So, how many layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Each \"1+3(\" starts a new layer. So, the expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, from the first 3, the first inner expression is 1+3(...), which is Layer 1: 1+3, Layer 2: 1+3(1+3), and so on, until Layer 9: 1+3(1+3(...)). So, yes, there are 9 layers. Therefore, my computation from Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct, leading to 3*(Layer 9)=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me try computing a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Suppose I have a simpler version: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). Let's compute that. Innermost: 1+3=4. Next layer: 1+3*4=13. Next layer: 1+3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Let's compute it step by step: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. Alternatively, let's compute it as per my layers: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40=120. So, that matches. Therefore, my method works for a smaller case, so I can be more confident it's correct for the larger problem. Another test: 3(1+3(1+3)). Compute that. Innermost: 1+3=4. Next layer: 1+3*4=13. Then, 3*13=39. Let me compute it: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13=39. Correct. So, my approach seems solid.

Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13 Layer3:1+3*13=1+39=40 Layer4:1+3*40=1+120=121 Layer5:1+3*121=1+363=364 Layer6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 Layer7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 Layer8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 Layer9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series, perhaps? Let me see if I can model this. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let me find A and B. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Let me solve for B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. To find the particular solution, we can assume a constant solution B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2. Wait, but that seems a bit odd because when n=1, a_1=4, which is positive. Let me check my approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can solve the recurrence relation more directly. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. Let me write out the first few terms to see if there's a pattern: a_1=4 a_2=1 +3*4=13 a_3=1 +3*13=40 a_4=1 +3*40=121 a_5=1 +3*121=364 a_6=1 +3*364=1093 a_7=1 +3*1093=3280 a_8=1 +3*3280=9841 a_9=1 +3*9841=29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. But perhaps I can find a formula for a_n in terms of n. Let's consider the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B +1 => B -3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9, which is (3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, that's correct. Wait, but just to make sure, let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can represent this kind of nested expression without computing each layer manually. This seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). But wait, the inner expression is similar to E but without the initial 3. Let me see. If I let E be the entire expression, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) where the inner part is similar to E/3, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can set up an equation. Let me denote the innermost expression as a variable. Let's say x = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). Then, x = 1 + 3x. Wait, that seems like a possible approach. If x = 1 + 3x, then solving for x: x = 1 + 3x \u21d2 x - 3x = 1 \u21d2 -2x = 1 \u21d2 x = -1/2. But that can't be right because all the terms are positive. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't correct because the expression isn't infinitely nested; it's only nested nine times. So, treating it as an infinite series might not be appropriate here.

Let's compute it step by step. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series, perhaps? Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. Now, let's see for n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Using the general solution: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 13. Now we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 (1) 9A + B = 13 (2) Subtract equation (1) from equation (2): (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Now, substitute A back into equation (1): 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer before the final multiplication by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Each time, the term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, starting from the innermost term, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). This is similar to a geometric series with ratio 3, but with each term added as 1. Let me see if I can model this as a sum. The expression can be written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Let me count how many times the 3 is multiplied. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Since there are nine layers, the innermost is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another multiplication. So, the total number of multiplications by 3 would be nine. Wait, but in the formula earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, it's 3^{10}/2 - 1/2. So, that's consistent with nine layers, each adding a multiplication by 3. So, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, that's another way to confirm it. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested series of terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term).

    "text": " Finally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so: Total = 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572 Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\nTotal: 3*29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. Each layer's result is used correctly in the next layer. I don't see any calculation errors in the steps. Let me just verify the final multiplication: 3 * 29524. Let's compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. This is similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n... and so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nI know that for such a recurrence, the closed-form solution can be found. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nIn this case, k = 3 and c = 1. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nB = 1 + 3*B\nB - 3*B = 1\n-2*B = 1\nB = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula holds for each layer. Therefore, the 9th layer is 29524, and the total expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression can be represented as 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer: 88572. That gives me confidence that the solution is correct.\n\nI think I've considered it from both iterative computation and the recurrence relation perspective, and both methods lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, I'm pretty sure the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the outermost layer equals 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the total value of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer manually, to save time and reduce errors. Let me think about the structure of this expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(the result of the previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with recursion. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each layer builds upon the previous one. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent with my earlier computation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Since this is a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors when I was multiplying 29524 by 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct.

Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number.

The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 =4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A -1/2 =4.\n\nSo, 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nAt n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nAt n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nAt n=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, that works. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n=1+3*a_{n-1}, and that the closed-form solution is a geometric series. So, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series might have been another approach, but the recurrence method worked well here.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of terms, each being 1 plus 3 times the next inner term.\n\n2. **Compute from the innermost layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Compute the outermost expression**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so I need to multiply 3 by Layer 9's result. Let's compute that: 3*(29524) = 88572 Hmm, that seems pretty big. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.) Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. But just to be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made an arithmetic error somewhere. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in the original problem, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's consistent with my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 =3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. Therefore, 3*a_9=(177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I double-checked using two methods: step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, both leading to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.

So, this is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of sequence instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The general form of such a sequence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the equation: P - 3*P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with our earlier computations to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's the result. I think this is correct. To double-check, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) step by step again. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then, moving out: 1+3*4=13. Then, 1+3*13=40. Then, 1+3*40=121. Then, 1+3*121=364. Then, 1+3*364=1093. Then, 1+3*1093=3280. Then, 1+3*3280=9841. Then, 1+3*9841=29524. Finally, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent.

So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern.

Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88,572.

Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think. The expression is a geometric series perhaps? Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, starting from L_1=4, L_2=13, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. We can solve for A and B. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59,049. So, 59,049 -1=59,048. Divided by 2 is 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the total expression is 3*(29,524)=88,572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer, which gives me more confidence that it's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Let me check if I interpreted the problem correctly. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with nine layers. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each time, the value is 1 + 3*(something), and that something is the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, I think my approach is correct. But just to be sure, maybe I can try a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's take a smaller version with, say, 2 layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) Compute this: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then, 3*13 = 39. Alternatively, compute step by step: 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3(13) = 39. Which is correct. Now, with 3 layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Then, 3*40 = 120. Let me compute it directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(13)) = 3(1 + 39) = 3(40) = 120. Correct. So, the method works for smaller numbers. Therefore, my approach is correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original problem has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: Starting from the innermost, each \"1 + 3(\" adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each layer is an additional (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: There are nine opening parentheses: each \"1+3(\" adds one. So, that's nine layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost. So, my calculation with nine layers is correct. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, then a_n follows a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer.

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88,572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since I only have nine layers, computing each step manually is feasible. But just to confirm, let me see if the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1=4 can be solved in a closed form. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.

Let me try again, carefully.\n\nLet me write down each step with the correct numbering.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nE2: 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nE3: 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nE4: 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nE5: 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nE6: 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nE7: 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nE8: 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nE9: 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3.\n\nWell, 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\nx      3\n--------\nLet me compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000 \u2192 Total so far: 87,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500 \u2192 Total: 88,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60 \u2192 Total: 88,560\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 Total: 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I started computing E1 to E9, I thought E9 was the innermost, but now I'm seeing that the entire expression is 3*E9, which would be 3*(29,524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's E1 = 4. Then each subsequent E is 1 + 3*E_previous. So, E2 = 13, E3=40, E4=121, E5=364, E6=1093, E7=3280, E8=9841, E9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9, which is 3*29524=88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly the number of layers. The original expression has how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first '(', each subsequent '(' adds a layer. Let's count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 3(1+3(...\n3. 3(1+3(...\n4. 3(1+3(...\n5. 3(1+3(...\n6. 3(1+3(...\n7. 3(1+3(...\n8. 3(1+3(...\n9. 3(1+3...\n\nSo, there are nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, E1 to E9, as I computed. So, E9 is 29,524, and 3*E9 is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the E computations. Let me go through each E step by step again.\n\nE1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nE9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check this with a different approach. I notice that each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting from E1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for E_n and then compute E9.\n\nThe recurrence relation is E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say E_n^p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is E_n = E_n^h + E_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition E1 = 4:\n\nE1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's test this formula with n=1: E1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: E2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: E3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, E9=29524, then the entire expression is 3*E9=3*29524=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I used two methods: direct computation layer by layer and finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations. Both gave the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar expression). By breaking down each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we can compute each layer's value and then multiply the final result by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next nested term. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer builds upon the previous one.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1 (innermost): \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). Let me compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number, but let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. The problem is $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$. So, when I count the layers, starting from the innermost, I have nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition: a_1=4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1=4 up to a_9=29524. Let me compute a_9 using this formula: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Perfect, that matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Each step follows logically, and the formula confirms the result. So, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. Using a recurrence relation formula, we confirm that the ninth layer is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."
