    "text": " Let me compute it correctly: 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should just multiply 29524 by 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So yes, 29524 *3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go back through each layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2:1+3*4=1+12=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3:1+3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4:1+3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5:1+3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6:1+3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7:1+3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8:1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9:1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524=88572 \u2714\ufe0f Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. This looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is computed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1, a1=4, n=2, a2=13, n=3, a3=40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. Now, solving the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a1=4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4. So, when n=1, a1=4= A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Yes, it works. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by recognizing a pattern and using a formula for the sequence. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a recurrence relation where each layer is of the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) with \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Find the General Formula**: Solving the recurrence gives \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Compute for n=9**: Since there are nine layers, compute \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\).\n\n4. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is \\( 3 \\times a_9 = 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Let me recount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(previous layer). Let me count how many layers there are.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3=4 (Layer1)\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let's see, the expression has 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so there are 9 layers. So, Layer1 is innermost, Layer9 is outermost. So, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, that was correct, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^n + D, where C and D are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution: a_n^(h) = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant D.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nD = 1 + 3*D\n\nSolving for D:\n\nD -3D =1 \u2192 -2D=1 \u2192 D= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4=3C -1/2 \u2192 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but given the structure, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, I think I did it right. Each layer builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1, then wrapping that into the next layer. It's like a recursive process, but since it's finite, I can compute each step manually. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable. I wonder if there's a pattern or formula that could give me the result without computing each layer. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. In fact, it's similar to the expansion of (3^n - 1)/2, but I'm not sure. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the layers I computed. Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1 Layer 2:13 = 3*(3 + 1) + 1 = 3^2 + 3 + 1 Layer 3:40 = 3*(3^2 + 3 + 1) +1 = 3^3 + 3^2 + 3 +1 Layer 4:121 = 3*(3^3 + 3^2 +3 +1) +1=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3 +1 Hmm, so each layer is a sum of powers of 3 up to that layer. So, Layer n: Sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, but actually, it's Sum from k=1 to n of 3^k +1? Wait, let me see. Wait, Layer 1: 4 = 3 +1 = 3^1 +1 Layer 2:13=3*(3+1)+1=3^2 +3 +1 Layer 3:40=3*(3^2 +3 +1)+1=3^3 +3^2 +3 +1 Layer 4:121=3*(3^3 +3^2 +3 +1)+1=3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3 +1 So, each layer is the sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=n, where n is the layer number, plus 1. Wait, no, actually, it's the sum of 3^k from k=0 to k=n, because 3^0=1. So, Layer 1: 3^1 +3^0=3+1=4 Layer 2:3^2 +3^1 +3^0=9+3+1=13 Layer 3:3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +3^0=27+9+3+1=40 Layer 4:3^4 +3^3 +3^2 +3^1 +3^0=81+27+9+3+1=121 Yes, that's correct. So, each layer is the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=n, where n is the layer number. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is S = (r^(n+1) - 1)/(r - 1). In this case, r=3, so S = (3^(n+1) -1)/(3-1) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Let me check that with the layers I computed. Layer 1: n=1, so (3^(2)-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: n=2, (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: n=3, (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: n=4, (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, that formula works. So, each layer n has a value of (3^(n+1)-1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since Layer 9 is (3^10 -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 -3=177144, divided by 2 is 88572. Same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer. That might have been faster, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step and verify with the formula, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer. I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer corresponds to the sum of a geometric series. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we determine that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, how many layers do we have?\n\nLooking back at the original expression: Each opening parenthesis is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n...\nThere are nine sets of parentheses inside the outermost 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is (1+3), Layer 2 is (1+3*(Layer1)), up to Layer 9, which is the innermost part of the outermost 3(...). So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). Therefore, the total number of layers is 9, so n = 9.\n\nThus, Layer9 = (3^{9+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo Layer9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

But let me double-check my computations for each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it step by step: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. So yes, 88572. Hmm, but wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524=88572. But let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1+3*(...). Let's count how many layers there are. Each time I see a 1+3(...), that's a new layer. Let me count: Starting from the innermost, the first is 1+3, then each subsequent one adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(1+3(...). Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers: Each time I see a 1+3(, that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n\nWait, so that's 9 layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So my initial counting was correct, 9 layers. So, layer 1 is 1+3=4, layer 2 is 1+3*4=13, and so on up to layer 9, which is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if my method works. Let's say, compute 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))). So, this is 3 layers. Let's compute it step by step. Innermost layer: 1+3=4. Next layer: 1+3*4=13. Next layer: 1+3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Alternatively, expanding the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) = 3(1+3(1+3*4)) = 3(1+3(1+12)) = 3(1+3*13) = 3(1+39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. So, my method works for this smaller case. Therefore, I can trust that applying the same method to the original problem will yield the correct result. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is multiplied by 3 to yield the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's do this step by step. 9841 * 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27.

Let's break down 29524 into parts: 29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. Then, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is indeed 88572.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series but with each term being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Wait, actually, it's similar to the expansion of (3^n - 1)/2, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), starting with L(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, L(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L(3)=1 +3*13=40, etc. So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. So, the equation becomes: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L(1) = 4: L(1) = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L(2)= (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, L(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute one more layer manually. Let's see, Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer6. Layer6 was 1093. So, 3*1093=3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer7 is 3280. Then Layer8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, same result.

Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Correct)\n\nThen, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions because this looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's try to solve it. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's assume a_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer using the formula to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Using a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2:\n\nn=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=2: (27 -1)/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll correct. So, the final step is multiplying by 3: 29524*3=88572. Yep, that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing a pattern that fits a linear recurrence relation, we can solve it efficiently. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), leading to a formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for the outermost layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me verify with another method. 29524 * 3: 30000 * 3 = 90000. 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's different. Hmm, so which one is correct? Let me compute 29524 * 3 again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-wise multiplication.

Wait, no, that doesn't match. Wait, the digits would be:\n\nFrom right to left: 2,7,5,8,8.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nMultiplying each digit by 3:\n\n4 \u2192 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u2192 6 +1=7.\n\n5 \u219215 \u21925, carry1.\n\n9 \u219227 +1=28 \u21928, carry2.\n\n2 \u21926 +2=8.\n\nSo the number is 8 (from the last digit) followed by 8, then 5, then 7, then 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 87572, which was wrong. So the correct result is 88572. Let me confirm with another method: 29524 \u00d7 3.

So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but earlier I thought I had 87572, which was incorrect because I miscounted the digits. So, the correct final result is 88572.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have the correct number of layers. The original problem has nine layers because it's 3(1+3(1+3(...))) nine times. So, starting from the innermost, I computed up to Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) n times. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I denote the nth layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. Which is exactly what I computed earlier. So, each a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A\u00d73^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A\u00d73^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A\u00d73^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u21d2 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)\u00d73^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3\u00d7a_9 = 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3\u00d729524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as 3\u00d7a_9, where a_9 is the 9th layer. But since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3\u00d7(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms the answer.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and then verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Using a recurrence relation, we find that the nth layer can be expressed as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the given problem with 9 layers, this results in 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. I recall that expressions like a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be represented using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about whether there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. That's a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in n=1: L_1=4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, for n=2: L_2=13 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. Now, subtract the first equation from the second: 13 -4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9=6A => A=9/6=3/2. Then, substitute A back into the first equation: 4=3*(3/2) + B => 4=9/2 + B => B=4 -9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2. So, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. That's the same as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. If I expand this, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Let me try expanding it step by step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, and there are nine layers, perhaps the total is 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ). Wait, no, because the formula we found earlier was for L_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, which is 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Let me denote E as the entire expression. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), and the inner part is similar to E but without the outermost 3. Wait, but in this case, the inner expression is only part of the layers, so maybe that approach isn't directly applicable. Alternatively, since we have a recursive formula, perhaps we can model it as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers, which we've already calculated as 88572. So, after going through all the layers and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nTo solve this, we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer is of the form $1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})$. We compute each layer step by step:\n\n1. Layer 1: $1 + 3 = 4$\n2. Layer 2: $1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13$\n3.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me do it step by step without breaking into parts. 29524 * 3: Starting from the rightmost digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. Next: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2. Next: 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next: 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2. Finally: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 is a 5-digit number, so multiplying by 3 should give a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me count the digits: 29524 is 5 digits, so 29524 * 3 is 88572, which is also 5 digits. Wait, let me verify: 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers, then each Li = 1 + 3*Li-1, with L1 = 4. This seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Li. Let's see, the recurrence is Li = 1 + 3*Li-1, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is Li = A*3^i + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me plug in the initial condition to find B. When i = 1, L1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. But I have only one equation and two unknowns, so I need another condition. Wait, perhaps I can consider the homogeneous solution and particular solution. Alternatively, let's compute a few terms to see if we can spot a pattern. L1 = 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1. L2 = 13 = 9 + 4 = 3^2 + 4. L3 = 40 = 27 + 13 = 3^3 + 13. Wait, that doesn't seem to help. Alternatively, maybe each Li can be expressed as (3^{i} - 1)/2. Let me test this. For i=1: (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, but L1=4, so that doesn't fit. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geometric series. Each term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me try to express Li in terms of a geometric series. Let's consider the expansion:\n\nLi = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) up to i terms.\n\nThis looks like a geometric series with ratio 3, but starting from 1 and having i terms. The sum of a geometric series is S = (r^i - 1)/(r - 1). But here, each term is multiplied by 3, so maybe the sum is similar.\n\nWait, actually, let me think recursively. Each Li = 1 + 3*Li-1, so it's a linear recurrence with solution Li = 3^i + C, where C is a constant. Wait, let's solve the recurrence relation properly.\n\nThe recurrence is Li = 3*Li-1 + 1, with L1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Lh_i = 3*Lh_{i-1}, which has the solution Lh_i = A*3^i.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form Lp_i = B, where B is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Li = A*3^i - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is Li = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Li = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it works.\n\nFor i=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor i=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor i=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor i=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer i, Li = (3^{i+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, so L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nTherefore, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer manually.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. Alternatively, since we have a formula for Li, we can express the entire expression as 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula checks out with the manual computations. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that again. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, so 5 with a carryover of 1.

Hmm, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, putting it all together, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and make sure I computed each layer correctly because that seems like a big number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me recompute each layer step by step: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3*29524 = 88572 (correct). Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that can be used here to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_n builds on the previous. So, this is a recursive sequence. Let me write down the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula. a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, we can see that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, to find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for our problem, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without having to go through each layer manually, which is much faster, especially if the number of layers is large. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, we can simplify the computation. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), leading to a general formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for \\( n = 9 \\) gives \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this result by 3 yields the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, but wait, I think I might have missed a step because the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer seems to follow the pattern: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. But we also have a_n = A*3^n + B. Therefore, equating the two expressions: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier by computing each layer. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. Therefore, the computed value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. By solving the recurrence, we find that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For n=9, a_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer because sometimes when you do these nested computations, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which propagates outward. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually, which might have been faster and reduced the chance of error. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. Now, this recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the general formula gives the same result, which confirms that my earlier computation was correct. This method is faster and less error-prone because it avoids manually computing each layer, especially when dealing with multiple layers. It's a good reminder of how recognizing patterns and applying mathematical formulas can simplify complex-looking problems. In summary, by either iteratively computing each layer or solving the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this, leading to the outermost layer being 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Let's compute 364 \u00d7 3: 300\u00d73=900, 60\u00d73=180, 4\u00d73=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093. 1093 \u00d73: 1000\u00d73=3000, 90\u00d73=270, 3\u00d73=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280. 3280 \u00d73: 3000\u00d73=9000, 200\u00d73=600, 80\u00d73=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841. 9841 \u00d73: 9000\u00d73=27000, 800\u00d73=2400, 40\u00d73=120, 1\u00d73=3. So 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then the outermost multiplication: 3\u00d729524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or use a formula for such nested expressions. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's find A and B. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check if this formula works for the layers we computed. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what we got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the recurrence relation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. Alternatively, recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression, we can compute it directly. But since it's a linear recurrence, the formula approach seems more straightforward. Either way, the result is 88572. I think I've verified it enough times, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous term.

Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. It seems like each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. For n=0, if we consider the base case, but actually, the first term is a_1, so maybe n starts at 1. Let me see if I can find A and B. We have a_1 = 4 = 3A + B. Now, let's compute a_2 using the recurrence: a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. Using the formula: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B. So, 13 = 9A + B. Now, we have two equations: 4 = 3A + B. 13 = 9A + B. Subtracting the first equation from the second: 13 - 4 = (9A + B) - (3A + B) => 9 = 6A => A = 9/6 = 3/2 = 1.5. Now, plugging A back into the first equation: 4 = 3*(3/2) + B => 4 = 9/2 + B => B = 4 - 9/2 = 8/2 - 9/2 = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

So putting it all together: 6 0 (from 2*3), then 7 (from 9*3), then 27 + 2 carried over gives 28, so 8, carry over 2. Then 5*3=15 +2=17, so 7, carry over 1. Then 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8, carry over 2.

Let me do it more carefully:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15.

So the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3 times that is 88572. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Wait, actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, the general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nWait, a_n = A*3^n + C, but I think I might have made a mistake in the particular solution. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nAssume a particular solution is a constant, a_p = C.\n\nThen substituting into the equation: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 0.5 => 3A = 4.5 => A = 1.5 or 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Let me check if this formula gives the same result as our step-by-step computation.\n\nCompute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation of Layer 9 being 29524. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11} is 177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So that's another way to compute it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident with this result now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from solving the recurrence, we determine that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3\u00d729524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to go through each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, doing it step by step is manageable. But just for fun, let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. a_3 =1 +3*a_2=1+39=40. a_4=1+3*a_3=1+120=121. a_5=1+3*a_4=1+363=364. a_6=1+3*a_5=1+1092=1093. a_7=1+3*a_6=1+3279=3280. a_8=1+3*a_7=1+9840=9841. a_9=1+3*a_8=1+29523=29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that works. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without manually going through each layer, which is efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But since the problem had nine layers, step-by-step was manageable. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n is of the form (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which is a geometric series. So, in this case, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next inner layer.

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. Let me recount the layers. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each \"1+3\" is a layer. Let's count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count: 1. 1+3 2. 1+3(1+3) 3. 1+3(1+3(1+3)) 4. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))) 5. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))) 6. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) 7. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))) 8. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))) 9. 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, yes, 9 layers. So, when I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, that's correct, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but wait, let me check if I correctly computed each layer. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Suppose I define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, for n=1: a1=4, n=2: a2=13, n=3: a3=40, etc., up to a9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9. So, if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n, that might help. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step, I arrived at the innermost value of 4, then built each subsequent layer up to the ninth, which gave me 29524. Multiplying that by 3 gave the final result of 88,572. Alternatively, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula confirmed that a9 is indeed 29524, leading to the same final answer. I don't think I made any calculation errors, but to be thorough, let me recompute the multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, we find each layer's value until reaching the ninth layer, which is 29,524.

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; total 900+180=1080+12=1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; total 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; total 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3; total 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So each layer builds on the previous one, and the numbers get large pretty quickly because each time you're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric series, but since it's nested, it's a bit different. But by computing each layer step by step, I can ensure that I don't make a mistake. I think I did this correctly. Let me just verify the multiplication one more time because that's where I might have made a mistake.\n\n29524 * 3: Let's break it down:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying each step, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer starting from the innermost one:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8.

So, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented as a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of layer n, where n goes from 1 to 9. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n from 2 to 9. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, perhaps. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), which can be expanded as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... up to a certain power. Wait, let's see: Let's consider expanding the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3^1. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1 + 3 + 9 =13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) =1 + 3 + 9 + 27=40=1 +3 +3^2 +3^3. So, each layer adds another term in the geometric series. Therefore, Layer n would be the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. Wait, but actually, Layer 1 is 1 +3=4= (3^2 -1)/ (3-1)= (9-1)/2=4. Similarly, Layer 2 is 1 +3 +9=13= (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Layer 3=1 +3 +9 +27=40=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. So, in general, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. That's consistent with the earlier result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the sum of a geometric series, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By expanding each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern of a geometric series. The nth layer can be represented as \\(\\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the 9th layer, this becomes \\(\\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous layer. So, it's like a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, the sequence is a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, etc., up to a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, the solution can be found. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3*previous, so it's like building up a number in base 3 or something, but I think the recurrence approach is solid. So, yeah, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Let me just write that in the required format.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are getting quite large, and sometimes when you have nested expressions, especially with multiplication, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me try to compute a few layers again to verify. Let's compute Layer 1 to Layer 3 again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, yes, each layer is correct. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can model this.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each step, and even derived a formula to confirm the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this until the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3=40, etc. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. Let me solve the recurrence relation to see if there's a pattern or formula that can give me a_n directly without computing each layer. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, let's see: the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then Layer 2 is a_2 = 13, which is (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. Similarly, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it again. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so the outermost layer is a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula from the recurrence relation, I end up with the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of each until reaching the outermost layer. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next layer})\\).\n\n2. **Compute innermost layers**:\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Sometimes when you're doing multiple layers, it's easy to slip up.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572.\n\nI think that's the right answer. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the structure, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nLet\u2019s define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, and each subsequent a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find A and B. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works. So, layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus three times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, which equals 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because this seems like a lot of steps and I might have made an error somewhere. Let me verify each layer computation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using recursion. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive formula. To find L_n, we can solve this recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, the equation is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. Let me write it as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution satisfies L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same answer.

Wait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when I multiply by 3, the result should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the calculations. Each layer builds on the previous one correctly, and the multiplication at the end gives 88572.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, that's correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think I have 9 layers in total. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach opening parenthesis is part of a new layer. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...))\n2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...))\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each \"1+3(\" as a new layer. So, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\nLayer 2: 1+3(1+3)\nLayer 3: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3(... eight times ...)\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of layers is 9. So, I think my computation is correct, ending up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is when we set a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has a solution of a_n = C*3^n.\n\nThen, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A \u21d2 A - 3*A = 1 \u21d2 -2*A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 *3 is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute each layer using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then for each layer, I can compute it directly without going through all the steps.\n\nBut since I already computed it step by step and cross-verified with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 \\) and each subsequent layer is \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\).\n\n1. Compute each layer step by step:\n   - Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n2. The entire expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9:\n   - Final result: \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems off. Let me check my multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake in breaking it down. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So yes, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make an error in one step which propagates outward. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, all the layers check out, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step again, just to confirm. Let me write down each step with the corresponding layer:\n\n1. Start with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*(29524) = 88572\n\nYep, that's consistent. Each step builds correctly on the previous one. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any arithmetic errors this time. It's a bit tedious, but taking it one step at a time helps prevent mistakes. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer individually. Let me think about that for a moment. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let's see if we can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n... and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. So, a_9 = 29524, and then the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, using the recurrence relation method also leads us to the same answer, confirming that 88572 is indeed the correct result.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Each term is multiplied by 3 each time, so the total can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. Let me explore this approach.\n\nStarting from the innermost layer, each term is 1, and each subsequent term is multiplied by 3. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on.\n\nBut since each layer is nested, it's a bit more complex than a simple geometric series. However, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series might still be applicable if we can express the entire expression in terms of a sum.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, as we saw earlier, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, leading to a closed-form solution.\n\nBut perhaps another way is to consider how many times 3 is being multiplied. Let's see: Each time we go out a layer, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, after nine layers, the total would be something like 3^9 plus some sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let me think. If we expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which would expand to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but actually, that's not quite right because each term is nested, so it's more like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) = 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*3*(1 + ... ) and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the total sum is 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but I need to verify that.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the expression step by step:\n\nStart with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, the next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13 = 1 + 3*4\n\nThen, the next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*4\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me try expanding each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, if I try to express this as a sum, each layer adds a term that is 3^k, but it's not straightforward because each term is multiplied by the previous layers.\n\nBut using the closed-form formula we derived earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or find the closed-form solution, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that 88572 is indeed the correct result.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say we have only two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute innermost first: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39.\n\nUsing the formula: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, then 3*a_2 = 39, which matches. So the formula works for n=2.\n\nSimilarly, for n=1: 3*(1 +3) = 3*4=12. Using the formula: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, then 3*a_1=12. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula holds for smaller cases, which further confirms that it's correct for n=9.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully computing each layer, verifying with a recurrence relation, and testing with smaller cases, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a geometric progression. Using a recurrence relation, we find the closed-form solution and verify it step by step, ensuring accuracy. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write it out:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7, carry 0\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8, carry 0\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572 because 30000*3=90000, and 29524 is 476 less than 30000, so 90000 - 476*3=90000 - 1428=88572. That checks out.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing the layers, I might have made a mistake because the number seems quite large, and I only had nine layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...) terms. From the innermost:\n\n1 + 3 is Layer 1\n\nThen each subsequent 1 + 3*(...) is a new layer. Let me count the number of layers:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3*(1)\n3. 1 + 3*(2)\n4. 1 + 3*(3)\n5. 1 + 3*(4)\n6. 1 + 3*(5)\n7. 1 + 3*(6)\n8. 1 + 3*(7)\n9. 1 + 3*(8)\n10. 1 + 3*(9)\nWait, that's 10 layers, not 9. So, I think I miscounted earlier. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524\n\nLayer 10: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 10), so it's 3*(88573) = 265719.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Did I miscount the number of layers? Let me check the original expression again.\n\nThe original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))).\n\nLet me count the number of 1+3... inside:\n\n1. The innermost is 1 + 3\n2. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, after the initial 3, there are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so Layer 2, Layer 3, up to Layer 9.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my initial count was correct with 9 layers, leading to Layer 9 being 29524, and then 3*29524=88572.\n\nBut when I counted the layers as 10, that was a mistake because the initial expression starts with 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3*(...), up to Layer 9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the confusion arises because the initial 3 is outside of Layer 9. So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, in total, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3. Therefore, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but when I first computed Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3, I got 88572. However, when I miscounted and thought there were 10 layers, I ended up with 265719, which is incorrect.\n\nLet me confirm the number of layers again. The expression is 3*(...), and inside, each (1 + 3*(...)) is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, the first ( is Layer 1: 1 + 3(...), then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the first 3:\n\n1. (1 + 3(\n2. (1 + 3(\n3. (1 + 3(\n4. (1 + 3(\n5. (1 + 3(\n6. (1 + 3(\n7. (1 + 3(\n8. (1 + 3(\n9. (1 + 3(\n10. (1 + 3\nWait, actually, the expression has 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, each starting a new layer. So, that would mean 9 layers inside the initial 3. Therefore, Layer 1 is 1 + 3, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers, leading to 29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but when I miscounted earlier, I thought there were 10 layers, but actually, it's 9. So, the correct answer is 88572.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me compute each layer again, just to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think my initial calculation was right, and the confusion came from miscounting the layers earlier. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. After computing all nine layers, the outermost result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4  \n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13  \n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40  \n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121  \n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364  \n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093  \n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280  \n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841  \n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524  \n\nFinally, multiply by 3:  \n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I messed up the digits.

So multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be expressed as a geometric series or using a formula. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. The expression is of the form:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )))\n\nWhich is a repeated application of 1 + 3*(...). This looks similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let me consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., which matches what I computed earlier. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a geometric progression. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 1 + 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Wait, actually, let me think differently. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, this formula works. So, the nth term is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3 is 29524, so the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost layer outward.\n\n2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each computation.\n\n3. After computing all layers up to the 9th, multiply the result by 3.\n\n4. As a double-check, model the nested expression as a recurrence relation, solve it using standard methods, and confirm the result.\n\n5. Alternatively, use the formula derived from the recurrence relation to compute the result directly.\n\nBoth methods led to the same final answer, so I'm certain that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29,524. Multiplying this by the outermost 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

In this case, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, recursively, each layer depends on the previous one. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Wait, because (3^{n+1}/2 -1/2)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Yes, that's correct. So, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
