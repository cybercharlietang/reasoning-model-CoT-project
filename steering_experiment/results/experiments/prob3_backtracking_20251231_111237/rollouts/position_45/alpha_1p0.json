    "text": " Let me do it properly. 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

So, 88572 is the right answer. Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can use the method for solving such equations. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let's see: The innermost is Layer 1: 1+3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). The outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. That's the same answer as before. So that confirms it. Therefore, the value is 88572. So, I think that's correct. I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I can be confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes, when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate a step, which would throw off all the subsequent layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270+9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 +3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Now, 3*29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 +27000=87000, 87000+1500=88500, 88500+60=88560, 88560+12=88572. So that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that can be generalized. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous term). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled recursively. Let me think about that. Let's denote L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent with my earlier calculation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this kind of recursive relation. The recurrence relation here is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps it can be solved to find a direct formula for L_n. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} Substitute the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Now, set the left and right sides equal: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition to find A. When n=1, L1=4. So, L1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Correct, which matches our earlier result. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can compute it without having to compute each layer step by step. That might be faster for larger n, but since n here is 9, computing each layer step by step is manageable. Either way, the answer is 88572. Let me just check once more to be absolutely sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Computing 3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute 29524*3 digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, we determine that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the ninth layer, resulting in 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, I think the final answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and I double-checked the multiplication at the end. So, I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f So, it seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's see if that's the case. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Yes, it works. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. This might have saved time instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if there were more layers. But since there are only nine layers, both methods work. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a linear recurrence relation. Using the recurrence relation, we derive a formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the final result efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series of terms, each being 1 plus three times the next inner term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, 60000+27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572. Yes, that's correct.

    "text": " Let me compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit. Let me write it out: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12, so 2, carryover 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, so 7, carryover 0.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15, so 5, carryover 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, so 8, carryover 2.\n- Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, so 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 (ten-thousands), 8 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 7 (tens), 2 (units). So, 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method: 29524 * 3. Let me break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. I just realized that I might have miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... 9 times ...))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, if I have 9 layers, then Layer 9 is the outermost one, which is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, in my earlier calculation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. So, that should be correct. But let me just double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication or addition.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 (correct)\n\nOkay, so each layer seems to compute correctly. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n >= 2\n\nSo, we can model this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's solve it:\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n.\n\nA particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\n=> C - 3C = 1\n\n=> -2C = 1\n\n=> C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\nL_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364, correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093, correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280, correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841, correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, correct.\n\nPerfect! So, using the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which is exactly what I got earlier. So, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n\nJust to recap, I approached the problem by recognizing the nested structure and computing each layer step by step from the inside out. Then, I verified each computation to ensure accuracy. Additionally, I derived a general formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations, which confirmed that my step-by-step computations were correct. This dual approach gave me confidence in the solution's correctness.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is essentially a geometric series. Let me explore that angle as well. Since each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, it's a linear recurrence with constant coefficients, which we've already solved.\n\nBut perhaps we can express the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 12) = 1 + 3 + 36\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3 + 36 = 40, which is Layer 3.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, considering that each layer multiplies the previous term by 3 and adds 1, it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1.\n\nBut perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum. Let me try writing out the expression fully.\n\nThe original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me denote each innermost term as t_1, t_2, ..., t_9, where t_1 = 1 + 3, t_2 = 1 + 3*t_1, etc., up to t_9, and then the entire expression is 3*t_9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding it:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nt_1 = 1 + 3\n\nt_2 = 1 + 3*t_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9\n\nt_3 = 1 + 3*t_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\n\nWait, this seems like a pattern. Each t_n adds another power of 3. So, t_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}\n\nBut wait, let me check:\n\nt_1 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1\n\nt_2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2\n\nt_3 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3\n\nSo, in general, t_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}\n\nWhich is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^{n}.\n\nThe sum of such a series is (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which matches the formula we derived earlier.\n\nTherefore, t_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our case, t_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*t_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this method also confirms the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(t_9) where t_9 is the sum of a geometric series up to 3^9, but scaled by 3. However, since t_9 already includes 3^9, multiplying by 3 would give us 3^{10} - 3/2, but that seems more complicated. The earlier methods are more straightforward.\n\nIn any case, all approaches lead me to the same conclusion: the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nJust to ensure that I didn't make any miscalculations, I'll recompute the final multiplication:\n\n29524 * 3.\n\nLet's compute it step by step:\n\n29524\n*      3\n---------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carryover.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus carryover 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, using another method: 29524 * 3.\n\nBreak down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, after verifying each step, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Let me compute 29524 * 3 directly. Let me do it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me verify this step by step because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can add 29524 three times: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 29524. Adding digit by digit: 8 + 4 = 12, carryover 1. 4 + 2 +1=7. 0 +5=5. 9 +9=18, carryover 1. 5 +2 +1=8. 2 + nothing=2. So, 88572. Yep, same result.

Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct. So, all layers check out. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which could be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially with so many layers. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Let me analyze the structure. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 1 +3=4. This is a recursive relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1. Solving for C: C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4. Then Layer 2 is a_2=13, and so on up to Layer 9, which is a_9. Let's compute a_9 using the formula: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence relation, I might have just computed each layer as I did initially, which also worked. But recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence was a good check to ensure that I didn't make a mistake in the computations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when multiplying large numbers repeatedly, so having a formula to verify the result is helpful. In summary, by computing each layer step by step and then applying the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same result both ways, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence relation, we can derive a formula to compute each layer efficiently. Using the formula, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{next layer})\\).\n\n2. **Define the Recurrence Relation:**\n   Let \\(a_n\\) represent the value of the nth layer.

Let me check that again because I think I might have made a mistake in the digits. Wait, 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, everything checks out. So, I think I've got the correct answer. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down step by step helped me manage the complexity of the nested expressions. I was worried about making a mistake with all those layers, but taking it one step at a time made it manageable. I guess the key here was recognizing the pattern and working from the inside out. Each layer builds on the previous one, so it's important to compute each one accurately before moving to the next. Also, making sure to carry over any numbers correctly when multiplying was crucial in the final step. I'm pretty confident now that 88,572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: Compute the innermost parentheses:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2**: Use the result from Layer 1:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3**: Use the result from Layer 2:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4**: Use the result from Layer 3:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5**: Use the result from Layer 4:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6**: Use the result from Layer 5:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7**: Use the result from Layer 6:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8**: Use the result from Layer 7:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9**: Use the result from Layer 8:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Final Step**: Multiply the result from Layer 9 by 3:\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each \"1+3(...\" is a new layer. Let me count:\n\nFrom the inside:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, 1+3(...)\n\nThen, 1+3(...)\n\nSo, each time, the number increases. Let me see: The innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, Layer 2 is 1+3*(Layer1).\n\nThen, Layer 3 is 1+3*(Layer2).\n\nContinuing until Layer 9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nYes, so 9 layers, each computed correctly as above.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 \u00d7 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression seems to follow a recursive pattern where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula confirms the earlier result. That's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, and then multiplied by 3 to get 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result.\n\nThat's another way to compute it, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.\n\nBut since I was able to compute it step by step, and then confirm using the closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value to be 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me compute 29524 * 3 properly. 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So the result is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's do it another way: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or use a formula, but since the nesting is only 9 layers deep, computing each step manually might be the simplest way. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, starting from 1, each time we're doing 1 + 3 times the previous term. This seems similar to a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. Then, the problem is to compute 3*a_9. So, let's compute a_1 through a_9: a_1 = 1 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 Wait, but earlier I had a_9 as 29524, but here, a_9 is 9841. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no, in the previous calculation, I had the innermost layer as 1 + 3 = 4, which would be a_1 = 4. But in this current approach, I'm defining a_1 = 1, which is different. So, perhaps I need to adjust my indexing. Let me clarify. In the original problem, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to the ninth layer. So, perhaps in this case, the innermost is the first term, and each layer adds one more. So, if I define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, etc., up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's compute that: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer. I can also think about this problem in terms of a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, no, in the previous approach, a_1 was 4, but in the earlier approach, when I started from a_1 = 1, that led to a different sequence. So, perhaps I need to adjust the initial condition. Let me think carefully. The innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4, which I can consider as a_1. Then, each layer adds another 1 + 3*a_{previous}. So, the sequence is a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40, etc. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The standard approach is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9, since we started from a_1 as the innermost term. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, if I think about it as a geometric series, each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added 1 each layer. But the recurrence approach seems more straightforward here. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, starting from 1 + 3. By computing each layer step by step, or by using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\), starting from the innermost layer \\(1 + 3\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers. Finally, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula for the nth layer, which confirms our step-by-step computation. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, that doesn't seem right because 29524 * 3 is actually 88572? Let me check with another method to confirm. Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So the final result is 88572. But wait, let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers.

Then 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) etc. So, yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's see, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Wait, but in our case, a_1 is 1 + 3, which is 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, the general formula for a_n can be found by solving the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. So, by using the recurrence relation, I can find a formula that directly gives me the result without computing each layer step by step, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger.

Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to approach this problem is to recognize the pattern as a geometric series or to find a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that for a moment. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value at layer n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. Solving such a recurrence can be done using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} is a_n = r^{n} * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, actually, let me recall the standard form. For a linear recurrence relation like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1), assuming r \u2260 1. In our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So here, r = 3 and c = 1. The initial term a_1 is 4, as we computed earlier. But actually, since we're starting from a_1, we need to adjust the formula accordingly. Let me check: The general solution for a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = r^{n}*(a_0) + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1). But in our case, a_1 = 4, so a_0 would be the term before that, which isn't part of our problem. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to index the layers starting from 0. Let me redefine: Let a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4 (which was our Layer 1). Then, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2). a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3). And so on, up to a_8, since we have 9 layers in total, right? Wait, no, the original expression has 9 layers, so if a_0 is Layer 1, then a_8 would be Layer 9. So, we can compute a_8 using the recurrence formula. The formula for a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}, where A is a constant. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n^{(p)} = B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_0 = 4: 4 = A*3^{0} - 1/2 => 4 = A - 1/2 => A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (9/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (9*3^{n} - 1)/2. Now, since we need a_8 (because we have 9 layers, starting from a_0 as Layer 1), plugging n = 8: a_8 = (9*3^{8} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^8 = 6561. So, 9*6561 = 59049. Then, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divide by 2: 59048 / 2 = 29524. That's the same as Layer 9 in our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_8 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches our previous result. So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula gives the same answer, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me see: Starting from Layer 1: 4, then Layer 2: 13, which is 4*3 + 1, Layer 3: 40, which is 13*3 + 1, and so on. So each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. This is indeed a geometric series with a common ratio of 3 and a constant addition of 1. The formula we derived earlier is a standard way to handle such linear recurrences. Another approach might be to unroll the expression step by step, as I did initially, but recognizing the pattern allows us to find a closed-form solution, which is more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers. However, since the problem only has nine layers, manually computing each step wasn't too bad. But it's good to know the general method in case the number of layers increases. Let me just verify the formula one more time to be sure. The formula was a_n = (9*3^{n} - 1)/2. For n = 0, a_0 = (9*1 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which is correct. For n = 1, a_1 = (9*3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which is correct. For n = 2, a_2 = (9*9 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. For n = 3, a_3 = (9*27 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121, correct. So, the formula holds for the initial terms, which gives me confidence it's correct.

But let me think if there's a better way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can express this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula.\n\nLet me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence relation:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nL_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier layers.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost one, n=9.\n\nL_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*L_9. So, yes, that would be 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me compute 3^11 again.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nYes, correct. So, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By recognizing this recursive pattern, we can derive a formula to compute the value efficiently.\n\nUsing the formula for the nth layer, \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), we find the outermost layer (n=9) and then multiply by 3.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{88572}"

So, 3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was computing each layer, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, which when multiplied by 3 gives 88572. But I think I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer again because 88572 seems a bit large, and I might have messed up somewhere.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Hmm, but let me check if the original problem has nine layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of (1+3(...)) sections. Each \"1+\" starts a new layer, so starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (...))). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1+3(\" adds another layer. Let's count the number of \"(\" after the initial 3:\n\n1. After the first 3(, there's a 1+3(\n2. Then another 1+3(\n3. And so on.\n\nWait, actually, the initial expression is 3 followed by 9 sets of (1+3(...)), so each layer adds one more. So, perhaps there are 9 layers, each adding a 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1+3=4, then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, etc., up to Layer 9: 1+3*Layer8=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I have 9 layers or 8 layers. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n... and so on until the outermost.\n\nWait, the original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of \"1+3(\" sequences. Each time I see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n- The innermost is (1+3)\n- Then, moving out, the next is (1+3(1+3))\n- Then, (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n- And so on, until the outermost.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is equal to the number of \"1+3(\" sequences. Let me count them:\n\n1. The innermost is (1+3)\n2. Next layer: (1+3(1+3))\n3. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. Then: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. Then: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. Then: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. Next: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. Then: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. Finally, the outermost: (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, that's 9 layers. So, each time I compute a layer, I go from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each time wrapping another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer9, I thought it was 29524, and 3*29524 is 88572. But I'm a bit unsure because the number seems quite large. Let me check if I made a mistake in computing Layer9.\n\nWait, when I computed Layer8 as 9841, then Layer9 would be 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841:\n\n3*9000=27000\n\n3*800=2400\n\n3*40=120\n\n3*1=3\n\nAdding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523.\n\nThen, Layer9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let's compute it again.\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n4 \u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +1=7 \u21927\n\n5 \u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover1\n\n9 \u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2\n\n2 \u00d73=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo, the result is 88572. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the number of layers might be 8 instead of 9. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Each time you see \"1+3(\", that's a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(1+3))\n3. (1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n4. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n5. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n6. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. (1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))\n\nSo, yes, there are 9 layers of \"1+3(\", which means 9 layers. So, the calculation up to Layer9 being 29524 and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572 is correct.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. Let me recall that for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^n * a_0 + c*(k^{n} -1)/(k-1), where a_0 is the initial term. Wait, actually, let me think carefully.\n\nIn this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4.\n\nWait, no, actually, a_1 is 4, which is 1 +3*1, but perhaps the indexing is different.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to index the layers starting from 1, where Layer1 is 4, Layer2 is13, etc., up to Layer9.\n\nSo, the recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nTo solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A =1 +3*A \u2192 A -3A=1 \u2192 -2A=1 \u2192 A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C -1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nWait, that seems promising. Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2= (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct, as a_1=4.\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct, as a_2=13.\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct, as a_3=40.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer9, n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct, as before.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 3^10 again:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series, but given that each layer is defined by a_n=1+3*a_{n-1}, which we've already solved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a telescoping way to compute it, but given that the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation both lead to the same result, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By expanding each layer from the innermost outwards, we compute each step until the outermost layer, then multiply by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\n10. **Multiply by 3:**\n    \\[\n    3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n    \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me check if I did each layer correctly because this seems like a lot of steps and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back through each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct)\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct)\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct)\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270+9=3279. Then 3279 +1=3280. Correct.)\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 9840+1=9841. Correct.)\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then 29523 +1=29524. Correct.)\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, this seems like a geometric series or something that can be represented recursively. Let me think about it in terms of a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A. Plugging into the equation:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it, using the recurrence relation. Either way, I end up with the same result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3^{10}=59049. Then, (59049 -1)=59048. Divide by 2: 59048/2=29524. Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked each step, used a different method (the recurrence relation) to confirm, and both ways I get the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...).

So putting it all together: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it digit by digit:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify with another method to be sure. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3. 29000*3 = 87000. 524*3: 500*3=1500, 24*3=72, so total 1500+72=1572. Now, add 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.

But let me check again because I think I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n2. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\n3. Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n4. Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\n5. Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\n6. Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\n7. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\n8. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\n9.

Let me check each step again.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nSo, yes, Layer9 is 29524, then 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check that multiplication again because 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, writing it together: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 88572 seems like a large number, but given the multiple layers of multiplication, maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about whether there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponent. 3^10 is indeed 59049 because 3^5 is 243, 3^10 is (3^5)^2 = 243^2 = 59049.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward, resulting in a final value of 88,572.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{88572}"

Each step involved a simple multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which seems manageable. I also double-checked my multiplication at the end to ensure accuracy. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I think the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer's value is calculated step by step. After computing the innermost nine layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the outermost layer by 3. \n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me do it properly. 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4. Calculating each term: 3*20000 = 60000 3*9000 = 27000 3*500 = 1500 3*20 = 60 3*4 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the layers step by step to ensure I didn't skip any or miscalculate.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again. 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the expression was 3*(Layer 9), but when I look back at the original problem, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is exactly what I computed as Layer 9. So, I think I did it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. The base case is L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to L_9. Then, the final answer is 3*L_9. So, in general, for such a recurrence relation, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can solve it as a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nGiven L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the final answer is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation method, I arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that 88572 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n\nWait, but that's not exactly accurate. Let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding each layer, we get:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27\n\nAnd so on, up to Layer 9. So, each layer n can be expressed as 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but that's a geometric series with ratio 3. The sum of a geometric series is S = (r^{n+1} - 1)/(r - 1). So, for r=3, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly what I found earlier with the recurrence relation. So, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, this method also confirms the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't recognize the pattern, I could have continued computing each layer step by step, as I did initially, and arrived at the same result. Either way, the answer is 88572.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524*3=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. I've approached it in multiple ways: step-by-step computation, recognizing the recurrence relation, and using the geometric series formula. All methods lead to the same result, so I don't think I made any mistakes here. It was a bit tedious, but breaking it down layer by layer helped a lot.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4. Each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2:** 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5:** 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6:** 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7:** 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8:** 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9:** 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute that again. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the problem is written as 3(1+3(...)) with nine layers, so the outermost 3 is multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524, giving 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if this forms a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 =13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3a_2 =1 +39=40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and maybe we can find a closed-form solution.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstitute into the equation: K = 1 + 3K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can compute it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is more efficient.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By recognizing this as a recurrence relation, we can derive a closed-form solution. Each layer \\( a_n \\) follows the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the ninth layer, \\( a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524 \\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let's compute 29,524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, I can do it step by step: 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2. 2*3=6+2=8. So, yes, 88,572. So, the final answer should be 88,572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me recompute each layer to verify.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524: Let me compute 29,524 * 3 again. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of parentheses again to make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's see: Starting from the first 3, the next is (1+3(...). Each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let me count: 3(1+3(... So, the first layer is the innermost: 1+3. Then each layer wraps around that. So, the expression is 3*(Layer 9), and each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9, that's 9 layers. So, my computation from Layer 1 to Layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in the manual computation. Let me see if there's a recursive formula here.\n\nEach Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), with Layer 1 = 4.\n\nThis looks like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general form is Layer n = a*Layer n-1 + b, where a=3 and b=1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence relation is Layer n = a^(n) * (Layer 0) + (a^(n) - 1)/(a - 1) * b, but since Layer 1 is the first term, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, actually, let me think about it.\n\nGiven that Layer 1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1 (if we consider Layer 0 as 1). So, if Layer 0 = 1, then Layer 1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4.\n\nLayer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer n-1, with Layer 0 = 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Layer n - 3*Layer n-1 = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: P = 1 + 3*P.\n\nSolving for P: P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=0, Layer 0 = 1.\n\nSo, 1 = C*3^0 + (-1/2) => 1 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer 9 would be (3^(10) - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing manually. So, that's a good check.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*Layer 9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10 again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me compute this again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\n*        3\n\n________\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as:\n\n29,524 * 3 = (30,000 - 476) * 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that works too.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with nine layers. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find each layer's value. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula to compute the ninth layer efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1=4. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Comparing both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1=4: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this.

Let me verify each layer step by step again to ensure I didn't make an error earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, I think my answer is correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could represent this nested expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually every time. Let me think about this. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let a_n represent the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n can be computed using that recursive formula. Let me write out the recursion:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nAnd then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this recursive approach confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. It seems that each a_n follows a geometric progression. Let me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where C and D are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the initial condition to find D. When n = 1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + D => 3C + D = 4. Now, let's consider the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^{n}. To find the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Wait, but that would give us a negative constant, which doesn't seem right given that our a_n values are all positive and increasing. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. To solve this, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 0.5 => 3C = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3})/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f. Okay, so the formula works for the first few terms. Therefore, the general formula for a_n is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, which is the 9th layer, we have a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10} first. 3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula also leads us to the same answer, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is correct. I think I've thoroughly checked my work, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed using the formula \\( a_n = 1 + 3 \\times a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find \\( a_9 = 29524 \\).

Hmm, seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 3*9841: 9841*3=29523, correct. Then Layer 9 is 1+29523=29524. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could be used instead of computing each layer manually.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated pattern of 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer.\n\nThis seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a recurrence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, each layer is a_n, so the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, and so on up to a_9=29524.\n\nSo, the expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution.\n\nLet me find C. Assume a particular solution is constant, so a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, using the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4.

Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nTherefore, the expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3*(a_9), but according to the formula, a_9 is the 9th layer, which is (3^{10}-1)/2. So, 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9= (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, that confirms it. The answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough.

It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 \u2192 -2C =1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3A - 1/2 \u2192 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but let me check if this formula works for n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrived at the same result, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step and even found a general formula to confirm the result. So, I feel pretty sure that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the result is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Maybe I should compute it more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 *3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 *3=12, carryover 1, digit 2.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, digit 7.\n\n5*3=15, carryover 1, digit 5.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, digit 8.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, digit 8.\n\nSo yes, 88572.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. But let me double-check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 *3:\n\n29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add them:\n\n29524\n+29524\n=59048\n\n59048 +29524:\n\n59048 +20000=79048\n\n79048 +9000=88048\n\n88048 +500=88548\n\n88548 +24=88572.\n\nYes, that matches. So, 29524 *3=88572.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in my earlier steps. Let me go back and check each layer computation again because it's easy to make an error in such a long chain.\n\nStarting over:\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check each layer again to make sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 +3*4=1+12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I have nine layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nCounting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I think there are nine layers. Let me count:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. (1+3(...))\n...\nUp to nine layers.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that's the innermost part. Then, the outermost 3 multiplies that. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the number of layers again to make sure I didn't skip any. Let me count the number of '1+3(' in the expression.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting after the first 3, each '1+3(' is a new layer. Let's count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. 1+3(...\n3. 1+3(...\n4. 1+3(...\n5. 1+3(...\n6. 1+3(...\n7. 1+3(...\n8. 1+3(...\n9. 1+3(...\n\nWait, but the innermost is (1+3), which is Layer 1, then each layer wraps around that. So, I think I did nine layers correctly.\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer 9, I ended up with 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I can compute the expression step by step again, just to make sure.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1 at the innermost.\n\nThen, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using standard methods.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c)\n\nWait, alternatively, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works perfectly.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, so 3^{10}=59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from the recurrence, each layer a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, a_9 is 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
