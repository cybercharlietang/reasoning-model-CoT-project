    "text": " Instead, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*24 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

    "text": " So, 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. 2 * 3 = 6. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that because I might have messed up the digit positions. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000 + 27000 = 87000 + 1500 = 88500 + 60 = 88560 + 12 = 88572.

So, yes. Now, 3 * 20000 = 60000 3 * 9000 = 27000 3 * 500 = 1500 3 * 20 = 60 3 * 4 = 12 Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate anywhere.\n\nStarting over, computing each layer step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Let me verify the multiplication step again because that's where I might have made an error.\n\nCalculating 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo writing it out:\n\n29524\n\n*         3\n\n---------\n\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 88572\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p\n\nSolving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, layer 9 corresponds to n=9.\n\nCompute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the recurrence relation approach also leads me to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. After computing all layers, we multiply the result by 3. Using both iterative computation and a derived formula for the recurrence relation confirms the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\). There are nine such layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:**\n   The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\).\n\n**Answer:**\nThe computed value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3 * 20000 = 60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me go back through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: As I did before, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 60000+27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 8 7 7 7 5 7 2. Wait, that seems off. Wait, maybe I should write it out step by step. Let me do that:\n\nMultiplying 29524 by 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27. Write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus carryover 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we have 8 7 7 7 5 7 2. Wait, but that would be 8777572, which is way larger than 88572. Hmm, that can't be right. I must have messed up the place values. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So when I multiply by 3, I should get a number that is 3 times that. Let me do it properly:\n\n29524\n\n*     3\n\n--------\n\nCompute each digit:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Ah, okay, that makes sense. I think I miscounted the digits before. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. That's correct. So, my initial calculation was right. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's it. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything. I started by identifying the nested structure and realized that each layer could be computed step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. I labeled each layer from 1 to 9, computed each one by substituting the previous layer's result, and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3. Each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which I did carefully to avoid arithmetic errors. After computing each layer, I double-checked my work by recalculating each step, which helped me catch any potential mistakes. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Instead, it's better to compute 29524 * 3 digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, the result is 88572. Wait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me double-check because the expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, when I computed Layer 1 through Layer 9, I think that's correct. But let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miscount. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: the last term is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each preceding one adds another layer. So, counting from the innermost, there are nine layers. Therefore, computing up to Layer 9 as 29524 and then multiplying by 3 to get 88572 should be correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute each layer again step by step, just in case I made an arithmetic error earlier. Let's go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series but in a nested form. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such expressions. Suppose we have an expression like a + a(a + a(a + ... )) with n layers. It might relate to a geometric progression. But in this case, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me define L_k as the value of the k-th layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to L_9. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9. So, each L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}. That's a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for L_k. The recursive formula is L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_k^h = C*3^k, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_k^p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A =1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_k = C*3^k - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 =4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_k = (3/2)*3^k -1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, L_k = (3^{k+1} -1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers: For k=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For k=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For k=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds. Let's say we have only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 +3)). Compute this: Innermost:1+3=4. Then, 1 +3*4=13. Then, 3*13=39. Using the formula: L_2=(3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Then, 3*13=39. Correct. Another test: three layers: 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))). Compute: Innermost:1+3=4. Next layer:1 +3*4=13. Outer layer:1 +3*13=40. Then, 3*40=120. Using the formula: L_3=(3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. 3*40=120. Correct. So, the formula works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it works for the nine-layer case. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524, we multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them all up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.

So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that each layer was correctly calculated. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the steps, leading to an error in the final result.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct)\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), this seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define the layers more formally. Let\u2019s say that each layer n is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, we can compute a_2, a_3, ..., up to a_9, and then multiply a_9 by 3 to get the final result.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = k^{n} * (a_0) + c*(k^{n-1} + k^{n-2} + ... + k^0). But in this case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so c=1 and k=3.\n\nWait, actually, the standard form is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c. Here, it's a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the solution would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + ... + 3^0). But in our case, a_1 = 4, which is when n=1, so perhaps we need to adjust the indices.\n\nWait, let's see. If n=1, a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1. So, maybe a_0 is 1, then a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on.\n\nSo, if we consider a_0 = 1, then the general solution for a_n would be a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^{k}.\n\nWait, let me verify that. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution for the constant term would be a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition a_0 = 1: 1 = C*3^{0} - 1/2 => 1 = C - 1/2 => C = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nThis confirms the step-by-step computation I did earlier. It's reassuring that both methods lead to the same result. So, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about this problem is by recognizing that each layer is a geometric series. Each time we have 1 + 3*(previous layer), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. The formula I derived earlier is essentially the sum of a geometric series, which is why it worked so well.\n\nIn summary, by either computing each layer step by step or by using the closed-form formula for the geometric series, we arrive at the same result. This problem was a good exercise in recognizing patterns and applying recurrence relations or geometric series formulas to simplify the computation.\n\nI think I'm satisfied with this solution. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and both methods led to the same answer. So, I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find the value of each subsequent layer until we reach the outermost layer. Multiplying the result of the outermost layer by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my earlier steps because I might have made a mistake in computing the layers. Let's go back.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. So 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. So 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524=88572. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...). Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(...)\n3. 1+3(...)\n...\nUp to 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, for n=1: a1=4\n\nn=2: a2=1 + 3*a1=1 + 12=13\n\nn=3: a3=1 + 3*a2=1 + 39=40\n\nn=4: a4=1 + 3*a3=1 + 120=121\n\nn=5: a5=1 + 3*a4=1 + 363=364\n\nn=6: a6=1 + 3*a5=1 + 1092=1093\n\nn=7: a7=1 + 3*a6=1 + 3279=3280\n\nn=8: a8=1 + 3*a7=1 + 9840=9841\n\nn=9: a9=1 + 3*a8=1 + 29523=29524\n\nThen, the final result is 3*a9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute it again step by step without skipping any:\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

So, 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check 3*29524 another way. Let me compute 29524*3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write down 7.\n9 *3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me think again. When I was computing each layer, I was going from the innermost to the outermost, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, and then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous with constant coefficients, except for the constant term. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous recurrence because of the constant term 1. So, to solve a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution would be the solution to a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Because the innermost layer is a_1, and each subsequent layer is a_n, so the outermost layer, which is the 9th, would be a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, and the formula approach also confirms it. So, yeah, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way outward. \n\nUsing the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\), we compute each layer up to the ninth. The closed-form solution for the nth term is \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, \\(a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " It should be 3 * 29524. Let me compute it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Wait, but let me check that again because when I did 29524 * 3, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let's do it more carefully: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So yes, that's 88572. Wait, but let me confirm with another method. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, but wait a moment, let me check the layers again because I might have miscounted. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Let's count the number of times \"1 + 3(...)\" appears. Starting from the innermost: Each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count: Starting from the innermost 1 + 3, then each 1 + 3(...) adds a layer. Let me see: The innermost is 1 + 3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost, how many layers? Let's see:\n\nStarting with 1 + 3, that's Layer 1.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer1) is Layer2.\n\nThen, 1 + 3*(Layer2) is Layer3.\n\nContinuing this way, how many layers do we have?\n\nLooking at the original expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(...\n2. 3(1 + 3(...\n3. 3(1 + 3(...\n4. 3(1 + 3(...\n5. 3(1 + 3(...\n6. 3(1 + 3(...\n7. 3(1 + 3(...\n8. 3(1 + 3(...\n9. 3(1 + 3(...)\n\nWait, actually, from the expression, the number of layers is 9, because each time we have a new 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer1, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the outermost layer is Layer9, which is 1 + 3*(Layer8), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, when I computed up to Layer9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572, that should be correct. But let me verify each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.\n\nLet me recompute each layer step by step:\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but when I computed Layer9 as 1 + 3*9841, that's 1 + 29523, which is indeed 29524. Then 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nBut let me check Layer8 again: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer6: 1 + 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 360+3=363, plus 1 is 364. Correct.\n\nLayer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer is computed correctly. Then, the final multiplication by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step again, maybe using a different approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can notice that each layer follows a pattern. Let me see if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression.\n\nLet me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\na_5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\na_6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\na_7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\na_8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\na_9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n, but that might be overcomplicating things for now. Since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute one more layer manually. Let's take a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds.\n\nSuppose we have only two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)). Let's compute that.\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nThen, 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, using the sequence approach: a1 = 4, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 13, then 3*a2 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother example: three layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n\nCompute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nThen, 3*40 = 120.\n\nUsing the sequence: a1=4, a2=13, a3=40, 3*a3=120. Correct.\n\nSo, the pattern holds. Therefore, applying it to nine layers gives us 88572.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( a_1 = 4 \\). After computing each layer up to \\( a_9 = 29524 \\), the final result is obtained by multiplying this value by 3, yielding 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is defined recursively. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see: The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = C*3^{n} + D, where D is a constant particular solution. Let's find D. Assume a particular solution is a constant D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59,049. So a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29,524=88,572. So, using the formula confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer, which confirms the result. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12.

Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the final step is 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern to generalize it, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually seems manageable. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). It's like a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. So, in general, each term can be represented as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, the value is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Using the formula for a geometric series, but since each term is nested, it's a bit different. However, since I already have a formula for a_n, I can use that to find the final value. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should compute it step by step without trying to do it all at once. Alternatively, use a calculator approach: 29524 * 3: Let's break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. 20000 *3=60000 9000*3=27000 500*3=1500 20*3=60 4*3=12 Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 +12=88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my computations because I might have made a mistake in the earlier layers. Let me go back and verify each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 +3*13=1+39=40 Correct. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 Correct. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 Correct. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Correct. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 Correct. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 Correct. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K +1 => K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct, but just to be thorough, let me compute a few layers using the formula to check. For example, a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=4 Correct. a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 Correct. a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers, so it's likely correct. Therefore, the answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Because if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is 88572. But let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, correct. So, I think my calculations are right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer manually, which might be faster and reduce the chance of errors. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for L_n. The recursive relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. To find A and B, we can use the initial condition and solve for them. Let's plug in n=1: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Also, since the recurrence is linear, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. To find B, we can assume a steady state where L_n = L_{n-1} = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 4 = 3A + (-1/2) => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. For n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Divided by 2: 59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 *29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, the computation of each layer seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, but just to be absolutely certain, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could represent this expression, so I can compute it without having to go through each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is defined as Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4. This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. Let's denote Layer n as L(n). So, L(1) = 4, and L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) for n > 1. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n, where C is a constant. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p(n) = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: L(1) = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L(9) = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, verifying each result. 3. After computing up to Layer 9, multiply by 3. 4. Additionally, derive a formula for the nth layer to confirm the result without manual computation, ensuring accuracy. This double-checking makes me sure that I didn't make any arithmetic errors along the way. So, yeah, I think that's it. The final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Layer 9: 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\nSo writing it out: 88,572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000 *3=27,000\n\n500*3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88,572\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So putting it all together: 6*2=12, so 88572? Wait, maybe I should just multiply step by step.

Wait, but let me double-check the layers because I might have miscounted how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+3(...\" is a layer, so starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each subsequent 1+3(...) adds another layer. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears.

Let's see: The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost: 1+3 is layer 1, then each time we go out, it's another layer. Let me count the number of closing parentheses: Each \")))\" at the end. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another set of parentheses. So, the innermost is 1+3, then each time we go out, we have another layer. So, how many layers? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the first layer after 3 is 1+3(...), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.

So, I computed up to layer 9, which is correct. So, layer 9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Wait, but let me verify the computations step by step again because sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let's go through each layer again carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 3*29524 might not be 88572. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7, carry over 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8, carry over 0.\n\nNow, the next digit is 9 (from 29524), but wait, 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, starting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, digit 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, digit 7, carry 0.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, digit 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 +1 =28, digit 8, carry 2.\n\n2 *3=6 +2=8, digit 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, to double-check, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572\n\nWait, 30000 *3=90000\n\n476 *3=1428\n\nSo, 90000 -1428=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nUp to 9 layers, as each opening parenthesis adds a new layer. So, yes, 9 layers, which I computed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis can be solved as a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, characteristic equation r=3.\n\nThen, the particular solution for the nonhomogeneous part. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant solution a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C +1 => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nUsing initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524.\n\nWhich matches the value I computed earlier for layer 9.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, I get the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(...). By solving each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows a geometric progression. Using the formula for such a recurrence relation, we determine the value of the innermost layer and work our way outward. Multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the pattern**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) = 3*20000 + 3*9000 + 3*500 + 3*20 + 3*4 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12. Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because that seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364 Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093 Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 Correct. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 88572. Wait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach. I notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Let me consider that each layer is a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is computed as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, let's compute a few terms to see if this matches what I did earlier: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's the same as before. Therefore, the 9th term is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's plug in the recurrence into the general solution: a_n = A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, equating the two expressions: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I end up with the same final answer: 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. This is a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for a_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^(h) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^(p) = K. Substituting into the equation: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, let's check this formula with our earlier computations. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer 9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, we can see that the result is indeed 88572. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could save time, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, computing each step manually wasn't too bad. I think I've double-checked my work enough to be confident in the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). Starting from the innermost layer and moving outward, each layer's value can be computed step by step. Recognizing the pattern, each layer follows a recursive formula \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\), which can be solved using the formula \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this formula for the ninth layer and multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Instead, I should compute 3 * 29524 directly. Let me do it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, earlier when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524. Let me verify that step again because if that's wrong, the whole calculation would be off. Let's go back to Layer 8: Layer 8 was 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 was 3280, so 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. That seems correct. Then Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 9841 * 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, writing it out: 9841 * 3: 1*3=3, write down 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 8*3=24 +1=25, write down 5, carry over 2. 9*3=27 +2=29, write down 9, carry over 2. But wait, 9841 is a 4-digit number, so after 9, there's no more digits, so the carry over 2 would make it 29823. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, 9841 *3: Let me compute it properly. 9841 *3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12, 8*3=24, 9*3=27. So, starting from the right: 3, then 2 (with carryover 1), then 5 (since 24 +1=25), then 9 (since 27 + carryover 0, because 25 didn't carry over anything beyond the 5). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply 9841 by 3: 1*3=3, 4*3=12 (write 2, carryover 1), 8*3=24 +1=25 (write 5, carryover 2), 9*3=27 +2=29 (write 9, carryover 2). But since there are no more digits, you write the carryover 2 before the 9. So, 9841*3=29523. Therefore, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. So that part was correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier layers. Let me recompute each layer quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can try a different approach. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is following a geometric progression or some kind of recursive pattern. Let me see if I can find a formula for this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms my earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. The general form seems to be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's try to find A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D - 3*D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, this method also confirms the result. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expression step by step without using the formula, just to make sure. Starting from the innermost parentheses: Compute 1 + 3 =4. Then, moving out, compute 1 +3*(4)=1+12=13. Then, 1 +3*(13)=1+39=40. Then, 1 +3*(40)=1+120=121. Then, 1 +3*(121)=1+363=364. Then, 1 +3*(364)=1+1092=1093. Then, 1 +3*(1093)=1+3279=3280. Then, 1 +3*(3280)=1+9840=9841. Then, 1 +3*(9841)=1+29523=29524. Finally, multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. So, that's another confirmation. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) step by step, writing down each computation. Starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 +3 =4. Then, moving out, compute 1 +3*(4)=13. Then, 1 +3*(13)=40. Then, 1 +3*(40)=121. Then, 1 +3*(121)=364. Then, 1 +3*(364)=1093. Then, 1 +3*(1093)=3280. Then, 1 +3*(3280)=9841. Then, 1 +3*(9841)=29524. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572. Yep, that's consistent.

Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier computations. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.

Then 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without calculating each layer manually. Let me see if there's a formula for such a nested expression. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since it's a small number of layers, computing each step manually might be faster. However, just for practice, let's try to find a closed-form formula. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1 =4. Then each subsequent layer up to Layer 9 is a_9. So using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer.

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 =4 Correct. Layer 2:1 +3*4=1+12=13 Correct. Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 Correct. Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 Correct. Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 Correct. Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer1=4, each subsequent layer is 1 +3*(previous). This seems like a geometric series or something that can be modeled with a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for the nth layer. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 =4. L_2 =1 +3*L1=1 +12=13. L_3=1 +3*L2=1 +39=40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume L_n^p = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D =1 +3*D => D -3D=1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer9, which is L9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Because n=9, so L9=(3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer9. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, since each layer is (3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 )= (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each step checks out, both by computing layer by layer and by using the recurrence relation formula. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation.

Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check my earlier layers again because I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers, which would throw off the entire result. Let me go through each layer again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*previous_layer. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which would allow me to compute a_9 without calculating each layer step by step. Let me try that. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the known values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we're dealing with Layer 9, which is a_9, let's compute a_9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without calculating each layer manually, which could save time and reduce errors. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. I notice that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me test this. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\nFor n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13.

For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10} to confirm. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, which confirms the result.\n\nWait, so instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have used the formula to find a_9 and then multiplied by 3.

Let me verify by another method. Let's break down 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there? Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, there's a 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3\n- Then each layer wraps around that, so starting from the innermost, each time we add a layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of opening parentheses. Let me look at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the structure is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count how many layers there are:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n...\nUp to Layer 9, because I can see that there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, actually, when I look at the expression, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of \"1 + 3(\" occurrences.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n... and so on until the 9th layer.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times we have a 1 + 3(...). Let's see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3, and each layer wraps around that. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n\nAnd this continues until Layer 9, which is the outermost 1 + 3(...), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I went up to Layer 9 and then multiplied by 3, which gave me 88572. But let me check if I actually have 9 layers.\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\nEach \"1 + 3(\" is an opening parenthesis, so:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) (Layer 3)\n...\nContinuing until Layer 9, which would be the outermost.\n\nWait, but when I look at the expression, the number of \"1 + 3(\" is 9 times. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time we add another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, as each \"1 + 3(\" adds a layer. Therefore, my initial calculation up to Layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nBut wait, in my initial calculation, I ended up with Layer 9 as 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. But let me verify each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression, which is up to Layer 9. So, my calculation seems correct.\n\nBut let me see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here to avoid computing each layer manually, in case I made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve it:\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^n + B.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, let's verify this with our earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, so the closed-form formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it without manually calculating each layer, which is good for verification.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify a particular method, either approach is valid. I think I've verified it thoroughly, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed in a closed form. Applying this formula, we determine the value of the outermost layer and then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested series where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). There are 9 such layers, starting from the innermost.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Apply the Final Multiplication**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Instead, 29524 can be broken down as 29000 + 524. So, 3 * 29000 = 87000, and 3 * 524 = 1572. Then, adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the final result should be 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a large number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. Let me go back step by step. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 3*29524. Let's compute this carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Starting from the innermost: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, there's a 1+3 followed by another parenthesis. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of 1+3(...) sections. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the innermost, then each subsequent one wraps around. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3, then Layer 2: 1+3*(Layer1), Layer3: 1+3*(Layer2), etc., up to Layer9: 1+3*(Layer8). So, that's 9 layers, each adding another 1+3*(...). So, yes, I computed up to Layer9, which is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a pattern here? Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's correct. Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a few layers using the formula to cross-verify. Let's compute a_4: (3^5 -1)/2 = 243 -1=242/2=121. Correct, as I had before. a_5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364. Correct. So, yes, the formula holds. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Okay, that seems correct. So the final answer would be 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to see if there's a shortcut instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. The original expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 =3*59048/2=3*29524=88572. Same result. So, that's another way to approach it, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form solution. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer manually, especially if there were more layers. But since there were only nine layers, it was manageable. I think I've double-checked my work enough times, and both methods give me the same answer. So, I feel confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers.

But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this without manually calculating each layer, in case I made a mistake in the layers. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. This is a recursive sequence. Let me denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1=4, L2=1 +3*L1=13, L3=1+3*L2=40, and so on. I notice that each layer can be represented as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} +1, with L1=4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n -3*L_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1 => A -3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L1=4. So, when n=1, L1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Let me check this formula with the known layers to see if it works. For n=1: L1= (3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L2= (3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L3= (3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: L4= (3^5)/2 -1/2=243/2 -1/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: L9= (3^{10})/2 -1/2=59049/2 -1/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572. I think this is correct because both the step-by-step calculation and the recurrence relation approach give the same result. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, when I computed up to Layer 9, that's correct, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524, so 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the original expression is indeed 3 times Layer 9. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(...))) where the innermost is 1+3. So yes, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9), so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nSo, the general formula for such a recurrence relation is a_n = (3^{n} -1)/2, but let me check that.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nGiven a_1 = 4\n\na_2 =1 +3*4=13\n\na_3=1+3*13=40\n\na_4=1+3*40=121\n\na_5=1+3*121=364\n\na_6=1+3*364=1093\n\na_7=1+3*1093=3280\n\na_8=1+3*3280=9841\n\na_9=1+3*9841=29524\n\nSo, each a_n = 1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=1.\n\nWait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, whose solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nK -3K =1 \u21d2 -2K=1 \u21d2 K= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4:\n\na_1= C*3^1 -1/2 =3C -1/2=4\n\nSo, 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 \u21d2 C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the solution. I think that's correct because both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation formula give the same result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and I think it can be solved using the method for such equations. The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's apply that here. Here, k = 3, c = 1. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since c is a constant, we can assume B is a constant. So, substituting into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms it again. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see: The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). If I expand this, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))). Expanding each layer, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))). Wait, but I think I already did that by computing each layer step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see: Each time we have 3^n terms. Let me try to see the pattern. When we compute each layer, each step adds another power of 3. For example, Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 = 3^1 + 1. Layer 2: 13 = 3^3 + 1? Wait, 3^3=27, which is more than 13, so that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a sum of 3^k from k=0 to n, but scaled somehow. Wait, let me think differently. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, if I expand a_n, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...))). So, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}. Wait, no, that's a geometric series. Let me check: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I expand it, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...))) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1}. So, a_n is the sum of a geometric series from k=0 to k=n-1 of 3^k. The sum of a geometric series is (3^n - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, that's exactly what I found earlier. So, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. So, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^9 - 1)/2. Wait, but earlier I had a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Hmm, now I'm confused. Wait, let's see: If a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k, then sum = (3^n - 1)/2. So, in our case, for layer n, which is a_n, it's equal to (3^n - 1)/2. But earlier, I thought a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check with n=1: a_1 = 4. If a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2, then for n=1, (3^1 -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1. But a_1 is 4, not 1. So that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me see: The innermost layer is 1 + 3, which is a_1=4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12=13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1+39=40. So, in terms of the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=40, which matches a_3=40. So, yes, the correct formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but let me just go through the layers again quickly to make sure. Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I think I'm done.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the digits.

Hmm, but wait, 29524 \u00d7 3: Let me verify using another method. 29524 \u00d7 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then + 9000 = 88048, then + 524 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miss any or compute incorrectly. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could be applied here, recognizing it as a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, then each subsequent term is defined by that recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A \u2192 A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A = 1 \u2192 A = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of each layer up to the ninth, and then multiply the result by 3.
