Because the outermost part is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = 88572 Hmm, that seems like a big number. Let me check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572, that seems right. Wait, but let me confirm the multiplication just to be sure. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3 step by step: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, I arrive at the total value of 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer is built upon the previous one, and since each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1, the numbers grow quite rapidly. It's a bit tedious to compute each layer manually, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. I can also see that this kind of expression is similar to a geometric series, but in this case, it's a nested expression where each term depends on the previous one. If I were to generalize this, it might resemble a recurrence relation, where each term is defined based on the previous term. However, for this specific problem, computing each layer step by step is straightforward and effective. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but to be absolutely sure, I can recompute a couple of layers to check. Let's recompute Layer 5: Layer 4 was 121, so 3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 6: 3*364 = 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 3*1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 3*3280 = 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, everything checks out. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each time, we're multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Let me write this down systematically.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, we have to multiply it by 3. Let me confirm: The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. 9*3=27, write down 27. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8\n- The next digit is 9, so 9 * 3 = 27, write 27\n\nWait, but 29524 is a 5-digit number, so after the 2, we have another digit? Wait, no, 29524 is 2 ten thousands, 9 thousands, 5 hundreds, 2 tens, and 4 units. So, when multiplying by 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1\n- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7\n- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1\n- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2\n- Ten thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication another way. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n= 60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the total expression is 88572. Let me just go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make a mistake in any of the earlier computations. Starting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent. So, each layer builds on the previous one correctly, and the final multiplication by 3 gives the result. I think that's it. So, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 + 3 times the next inner layer. Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13 first: that's 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364 first. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so adding those together: 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Well, 1000*3 is 3000, and 93*3 is 279, so adding them together: 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, and 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, and 41*3 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, and 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes, when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up. Let's verify each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3. 2*3=6, 9*3=27, 5*3=15, 2*3=6, 4*3=12. Wait, but that's digit-wise, which might be confusing. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3. 20,000 * 3 = 60,000. 9,000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, add them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yep, that's the same as before. So, I think my calculation is correct.

So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 becomes 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, moving to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so Layer 3 is 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. So, Layer 3 is 40. Let's do Layer 4 now: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 is 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, the numbers are getting bigger quickly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so Layer 5 is 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Therefore, Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Thus, Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Therefore, Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 123 = 29523. So, Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Wait, actually, that's not the most efficient way. Alternatively, 3*29524 can be computed as 3*(29000 + 524) = 3*29000 + 3*524. 3*29000 = 87000. 3*524: Let's compute 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72, so 1500 + 72 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, 3*29524 = 88572. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems correct. Each layer was computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, which gives the next layer. The final step was multiplying the last layer by 3, which gave me 88572. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, each layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost expression is reached.

Because the entire expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let me do that multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together, 29524 * 3 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to be sure. Maybe I should break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Maybe I should compute each layer again quickly to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, multiplying 29524 by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original problem is 3 times (Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 29524. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Hmm, but maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here to avoid computing each layer manually, which could save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2\n...\nL_9 = 1 + 3*L_8\n\nThis looks like a geometric series or perhaps a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nLooking at the first few layers:\nL_1 = 4\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nI notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*(3)^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\nC - 3C = 1\n-2C = 1\nC = -1/2\n\nWait, that gives a negative particular solution, but our L_n are all positive and increasing. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me test this formula for n=1:\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f which matches L_1=4\n\nFor n=2:\n\n(3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f which matches L_2=13\n\nn=3:\n\n(3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f matches L_3=40\n\nn=4:\n\n(3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f matches L_4=121\n\nn=5:\n\n(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f matches L_5=364\n\nn=6:\n\n(3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f matches L_6=1093\n\nn=7:\n\n(3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f matches L_7=3280\n\nn=8:\n\n(3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f matches L_8=9841\n\nn=9:\n\n(3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f matches L_9=29524\n\nGreat! So the formula L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 works perfectly. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, which is what I computed earlier.\n\nSo, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * (3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147\n\nThen, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572\n\nWhich matches the earlier result. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Using the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\) for the nth layer, we compute the innermost layers step by step up to the 9th layer. Finally, multiplying the 9th layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is nested with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times (\\text{previous layer})\\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Apply the Formula:**\n   Using the formula \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\), for \\( n = 9 \\):\n   \\[\n   L_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply by 3:**\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me do the multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.

Looking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI wonder if there's a recurrence relation here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can model it as such. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. That seems correct. So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since our layers go up to n=9, let's compute L_9 using the formula: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the whole expression is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, especially in the multiplications. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each step seems to be correct. Each time, I multiplied by 3 and added 1. Let me verify a couple of layers to be sure. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 was 13, so 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. I think I did this correctly.

Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so Layer 3 is 40. Let's do Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, that's growing quickly. Layer 5 would be 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: 3*121 = 363, so Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, same result as before. But wait, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3,..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, I can see that each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for L(n). Let's see. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. Let's try to find a closed-form solution for L(n). This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from L(n) = 3*L(n-1), which has the solution L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Let me verify this with n=1: L(1) = (3^2)/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for L9, which is n=9: L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, I could have noticed that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. But using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form solution helps avoid computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers were larger. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer grows exponentially. Using a recurrence relation, we derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer, which allows us to compute the value efficiently. Applying this formula, we determine that the entire expression evaluates to 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Hmm, 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. That's Layer 3. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. Well, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 364*3. Let me compute that: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the result of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, especially since this could be time-consuming for more layers. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. It looks like a linear recurrence, and perhaps we can find a closed-form solution for it. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the formula for the nth term. In this case, k is 3 and c is 1. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me apply this. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, that's a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if this formula works for the first few layers. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is 3*a_9, and a_9 is 29524, so 3*29524 is indeed 88572. Just to be thorough, let me verify the multiplication: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression, we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.

So that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39, then adding 1: 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40 Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093.

Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, 3*29524.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Next layer: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Layer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nWait, let me compute the next one to see if a pattern emerges. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Hmm, 4, 13, 40, 121... These numbers seem familiar. Wait, 4 is 4, 13 is 13, 40 is 40, 121 is 121. Wait a second, 121 is 11 squared, right? 11*11=121. 40 is 4*10, 13 is 13, and 4 is 4. Not sure if that's a pattern, but maybe there's something else. Let me compute a few more layers to see if I can spot a trend. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7: 3280.

Wait, let me verify that because that seems like a big number, but considering how many layers there are, it might make sense. Let me check each layer again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the steps. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct.) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct.) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct.) Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive formula, but since it's only nine layers, computing each step manually might be the most straightforward way, even if it's a bit tedious. Another way to approach this might be to recognize the pattern as a repeated multiplication and addition, which could be expressed recursively. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let\u2019s define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with the base case f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. So, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which matches what I had before. Similarly, f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, this recurrence relation seems accurate. The problem is asking for 3*f(9), since the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, if I compute f(9), which is 29524, and then multiply by 3, I get 88,572. Alternatively, if I wanted to find a closed-form solution for f(n), I could solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence relation is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving for A and B. The recurrence is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume f_p(n) = C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: f(1) = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, f(n) = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. So, for n=9: f(9) = (3^10 -1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, f(9) = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, let's compute 3*29524. Let me break this down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to just compute 29524*3 directly. Let's do that: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15, plus 2 is 17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my multiplication again because 29524*3 seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it step by step: 29524 * 3. Let me compute each digit: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. But wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me write it out properly:\n\n     29524\n   x    3\n   -------\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7.\nSo, reading the digits from top to bottom: 7, 7, 8, 5, 2. Wait, that would make 88572. Let me verify with another method. Let's compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524 * 3:\n20000*3 = 60000\n9000*3 = 27000\n500*3 = 1500\n20*3 = 60\n4*3 = 12\nNow, add them all together:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or compute incorrectly.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Each layer builds upon the previous one correctly. So, I think 88572 is the right answer. Wait, but I just realized that the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous layer). So, after Layer 9, we multiply by 3. So, yeah, 88572 is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. With L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation of Layer 9. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods agree. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the recurrence relation method confirms it. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's calculate 3*121: 121*3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. 364*3: Let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Hmm, 1093*3: Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841.

Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me verify each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nFinal multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))), which is a geometric series perhaps? Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Hmm, maybe I can find a recursive formula for a_n. Let's see:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n\n...\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis looks like a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, the equation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution comes from the associated homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nK - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4. So,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer a_n, it's (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier result using a different method. It's reassuring that both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach give the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined by 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up. Let me verify each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, same result. Okay, so I think I did that correctly.

So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, we have 3*(29524). Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Substituting Layer 2: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). That's 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*120 is 360, plus 3*1 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). So, 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). So, 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding them: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). So, 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, 1 + 3*9841.

Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8.

Wait, but the number is 29524, so the digits are: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 29524 * 3:\n\n- Units place: 4*3=12.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Calculating 3*40: 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. So, Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*120 = 360, and 3*1 = 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: Let's break it down: 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, and 3*4 = 12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, 3*1 = 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, 3*4 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 directly: 4*3 = 12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 9*3=27, carry over 2. 8*3=24 +2=26, carry over 2. 6*3=18 +2=20. So writing it down: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. Next: 5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. Next: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carry 2. Next: 8*3=24 +2=26, write 6, carry 2. Next: 6*3=18 +2=20, write 0, carry 2. Finally, since there are no more digits, write 2. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, but when I did the initial breakdown, I thought it was 88572, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I ended up with 88572 as well. So, that seems consistent. But let me verify once more because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers just to make sure I didn't skip any or miscalculate.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers seem correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that should be the answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression using another approach, like expanding the terms or recognizing a pattern.\n\nWait a minute, this expression seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got for Layer 9 earlier. So, that confirms that Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my previous calculation. So, that seems to confirm the answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute the expression from the innermost parentheses step by step again, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all layers check out. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n8 * 3 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carry over 2.\n\n6 * 3 = 18 + 2 = 20, write down 0, carry over 2.\n\nNo more digits, so write down 2.\n\nPutting it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Let me verify that: 30000 * 3 = 90000. 476 * 3 = 1428. So, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Correct again.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40 Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.

Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving to Layer 2: It's 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value, we get: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, let's compute that: 3 * 29524 = ? Hmm, let me do that multiplication carefully. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: 1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524: Let me verify that multiplication again. 29524 * 3:\n\n- 29,524 * 3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n- 2*3 = 6 +1 =7\n- 5*3=15, carryover 1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8\n- 2*3=6\n\nWait, that might not be the right way. Let me write it down:\n\n     29524\n   x      3\n   --------\n     88572\n\nYes, because:\n\n- 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7\n- 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8\n- The next digit is 2, so 2*3=6, write down 6\n\nSo, it's 88,572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of 29,524 * 3 as (30,000 - 476) *3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistake in the layers. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount or miscalculate a step. Let me go through each layer again:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n4. Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n5. Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n6. Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n7. Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n8. Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n9. Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAll layers check out. So, the final computation is 3*29,524=88,572. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a recurrence relation. Let me think about that for a second. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 =4\na_2=1 +3*a_1=13\na_3=1 +3*a_2=40\n... and so on.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis kind of recurrence can be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed:\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works for all layers. So, using this formula, I can compute a_9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the result is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't notice the recurrence, I could have just computed each layer step by step, as I did initially. But recognizing the pattern made it easier, especially since the number of layers is manageable. It's interesting how these nested expressions can sometimes be simplified using recurrence relations or other algebraic techniques. I guess practice helps in spotting such patterns more quickly.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Identify the nested structure and note that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost one, working outward.\n\n3. Recognize the recurrence relation and solve it to find a general formula for each layer.\n\n4. Use the formula to compute the value of the outermost layer.\n\n5. Multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nThis methodical approach helps avoid mistakes and ensures that each step is correct before moving on. It's also a good practice to verify the computations, especially when dealing with multiple layers or complex expressions. Taking the time to double-check can save a lot of frustration later on, especially if a small error in one step propagates through all subsequent calculations.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and recognizing the underlying pattern, I was able to compute the value of the expression efficiently. It's a good reminder of how important it is to carefully analyze the structure of a problem before diving into computations.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of each layer. Recognizing the recurrence relation allows us to derive a formula for each layer, which simplifies the computation. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each term is \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). There are nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n   - Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   - Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   - Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   - Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   - Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   - Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   - Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   - Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. **Compute the Final Expression:**\n   Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, let me compute that:\nTotal = 3 * 29524 = 88572\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again more carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nNow, multiplying Layer 9 by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\nAdding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Hmm, that's the same as before. So, maybe it's correct. But let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). This looks similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., as I computed earlier. So, each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f So, the formula seems correct. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Which matches my earlier computation. Now, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize the pattern as a geometric series. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1. Let me try expanding the expression step by step without using the formula, just to confirm.\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to express the entire expression in terms of a sum. Let me denote the entire expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). There are nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me try to expand this expression step by step, but I think it's similar to what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me see:\n\nEach time, we have 3 multiplied by a term that includes 1 plus 3 times another term, and so on. So, expanding the expression, we can see that each layer adds another power of 3. Let me try to write it out:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this step by step:\n\nStarting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nLet me compute the innermost part first:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, E = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSame result again. So, I think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see this as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me think about the expansion.\n\nEach time we have a 1 added and then multiplied by 3, so each layer contributes a term that is 3^k, where k is the number of layers from the innermost. Let me try to see:\n\nThe innermost term is 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1\n\nThe next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 1 + 3*(3 + 1) = 1 + 9 + 3 = 13\n\nWait, but that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression can be written as a sum of 3^10 -1 over something. Wait, from the formula earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, and then E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see the entire expression as 3*(sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k). Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). Each time, the innermost term is 1 + 3, then each outer layer adds another 3*(...). So, perhaps the total can be expressed as 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8). Let me check that.\n\nWait, if I have 9 layers, starting from 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, perhaps the total inside the outermost parentheses is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) which would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) up to 9 layers. But perhaps the sum inside is a geometric series with 9 terms. Let me think.\n\nWait, if I denote S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, then S = (3^9 -1)/(3 -1) = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. But wait, earlier, when I computed up to layer 9, I got 29524, which is 3*9841. Hmm, that's interesting. Wait, but in our problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(a_9), where a_9 = 29524, as computed before. Wait, but 3*9841 = 29523, which is one less than 29524. So, perhaps my initial assumption is slightly off.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum S is from k=0 to 8, which is 9 terms, so S = (3^9 -1)/2 = 9841, as computed. Then, the expression inside the outermost parentheses is 1 + 3*S = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, which matches our a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, so in effect, the entire expression can be seen as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(1 + 3*S), where S is the sum up to 3^8. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nBut perhaps this is complicating things more than necessary. The straightforward computation seems to have worked, and the formula using the recurrence relation also confirms the same result.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving out one layer: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next layer: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me check the next layer to see if the pattern continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Wait a minute, so far we have: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121. Let me see if I can spot a pattern or a formula here. Each layer seems to be following the formula: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive formula where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can express this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where a_1 = 4, and a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >= 2. So, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121, and so on, up to a_9, since there are nine layers. Once I compute a_9, the entire expression will be 3*(a_9), right? Because the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, my goal is to compute a_9, and then multiply it by 3 to get the final result. Now, let's compute the subsequent layers one by one. I'll make a table to keep track.\n\nLayer | Calculation | Value\n-----|-------------|------\n1    | 1 + 3       | 4\n2    | 1 + 3*4     | 13\n3    | 1 + 3*13    | 40\n4    | 1 + 3*40    | 121\n5    | 1 + 3*121   | 364\n6    | 1 + 3*364   | 1093\n7    | 1 + 3*1093  | 3280\n8    | 1 + 3*3280  | 9841\n9    | 1 + 3*9841  | 29524\n\nWait, let me double-check these calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let's compute that. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3: Let's compute 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down:\n\n20000*3 = 60000\n\n9000*3 = 27000\n\n500*3 = 1500\n\n20*3 = 60\n\n4*3 = 12\n\nAdding them together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any errors in the layers. Let me go back and check each step again.\n\nLayer 1: 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524. Correct.\n\n3*29524=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. To be thorough, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step, just to verify.\n\nLooking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's plug in the recurrence into the general solution:\n\na_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nAssume a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSo, setting equal to the assumed form:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B.\n\nSubtracting A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSo, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2.\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2.\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, the value of the innermost expression at layer 9 is 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final result: 3*29524=88572.\n\nJust to make sure, let's compute 3^{10} to confirm:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{10}=59049, and (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or the reasoning. So, the problem is solved.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite large, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't miscalculate. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Wait, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (3*3280 is indeed 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (3*9841: 9840*3=29520, plus 1*3=3, so 29520+3=29523, plus 1 is 29524. Correct) Then, the final step: 3*29524. Let's compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's breaking it down digit by digit. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, writing it down: 29524 *3 = 88572. Wait, that's what I got before, so maybe it's correct. But let me check using another method. Let me compute 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 29524. 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9000 = 88048. 88048 + 500 = 88548. 88548 + 24 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So, the final result is 88572. Hmm, that seems quite large, but considering each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added to 1, the numbers do grow exponentially. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define a recurrence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. The particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have nine layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that. 3^11 is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think this confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. It's interesting that using the recurrence relation gives the same result without having to compute each layer individually, which could be time-consuming, especially for more layers. So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 is handy here. But for someone just starting out, computing each layer step by step is a good way to understand how the numbers grow so quickly. It's also a good reminder of how exponential growth works in nested multiplications. So, in summary, by either method\u2014computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation\u2014we arrive at the same final answer of 88572. I think I'm confident with this result now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Then add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841\nCompute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524\nNow, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524.\n\nCompute 3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Maybe a better way is to compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\nx     3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the layers check out. So, I think the computation is correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I can think of another way to approach this problem, perhaps using a formula or recognizing a pattern.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me see if I can model it that way.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nSo, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nWait, but when n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me test this formula with the earlier layers to see if it holds.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=2187-1=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=6561-1=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=19683-1=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=59049-1=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! The formula works for each layer. So, the 9th layer is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, using both iterative computation and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm ready to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. Each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; adding those up: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; adding up: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; adding them gives 9000+840=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let's do that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.

So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524\nNow, after computing all layers up to Layer 9, we have the value of the innermost parentheses as 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this Layer 9 result. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Wait, no, that's not correct because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Now, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute it again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final answer of 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can try a different approach or look for a pattern. Alternatively, I could recognize that this expression is a geometric series. Let me see: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. This looks like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging in n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. For n=2: a_2 = A*3^2 + B = 9A + B = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, we have two equations: 3A + B = 4 and 9A + B = 13. Subtracting the first equation from the second: (9A + B) - (3A + B) = 13 - 4 => 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. Then, plugging A back into the first equation: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = (8/2 - 9/2) = -1/2. So, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. In our problem, we have 9 layers (from the innermost to the outermost), so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. I think I'm confident with this answer now.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a geometric series. The final computation shows that the value of the entire expression is 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Alright, moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's do Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280.

Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is: 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 = Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 72 = 88572 So, 3 * 29524 = 88572 Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.
