    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, so each time, we're multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern here. Layer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nWait a second, 4, 13, 40... That seems like each term is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1, but let me check. From Layer 1 to Layer 2: 4*3 + 1 = 13, which matches. From Layer 2 to Layer 3: 13*3 + 1 = 40, which also matches. So, it seems like each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, if I can express each layer in terms of the previous one, I can compute each step more quickly. Let me try to compute all layers up to Layer 9. I'll make a table to keep track:\n\nLayer | Value\n-----|------\n1    | 4\n2    | 13\n3    | 40\n4    | ?\n5    | ?\n6    | ?\n7    | ?\n8    | ?\n9    | ?\n\nOkay, starting with Layer 1 as 4. Now, Layer 2 is 3*4 + 1 = 13. Layer 3 is 3*13 + 1 = 40. Let's keep going.\n\nLayer 4: 3*40 + 1 = 121\nLayer 5: 3*121 + 1 = 364\nLayer 6: 3*364 + 1 = 1093\nLayer 7: 3*1093 + 1 = 3280\nLayer 8: 3*3280 + 1 = 9841\nLayer 9: 3*9841 + 1 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check these calculations because they seem to be growing very rapidly, and I might have made a mistake in multiplication. Let me verify each step.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nOkay, so each layer is indeed 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, the original problem is 3 times Layer 9. Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part is Layer 1, so the outermost operation is 3*Layer 9. Let me confirm the structure of the original problem.\n\nOriginal expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, yes, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 9. Therefore, the total value is 3*Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524 = ?\n\nWell, 3*29524. Let me compute step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nTherefore, the total value is 88572.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations because this seems like a very large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any errors in the earlier steps.\n\nLet me recompute each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of nested expression instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nThis is a recursive expression where each term is defined as 1 + 3*previous term. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nGiven that a_1 = 4, let's solve for A and B.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nK = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K:\n\nK - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect, the formula works for each layer. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 29524.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nSo, 3^{11} = 177147.\n\nThen, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the exponentials:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{11} is indeed 177147. Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nAlright, so after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation formula, and confirming the exponentials, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given math problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression. Each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\). We can compute each layer step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer using the result from the previous layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   \\text{Layer 2} & : 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 3} & : 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 4} & : 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 5} & : 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 6} & : 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 7} & : 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 8} & : 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   \\text{Layer 9} & : 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. The outermost expression is 3 times the result of Layer 9:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Layer 2: 13 Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40 Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). That's 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 3*120 = 360, and 3*1 = 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.

Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524 Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding those together: 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding up: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding those: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so we need to compute 3*29524. Let's calculate that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got it. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Plugging in Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay. Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 29524 * 3 equals 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. It's easy to make a mistake when dealing with so many layers. Let me go back and verify each layer step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this again: 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a pattern or formula that could have simplified this process, instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. Substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1. Solving for L_p: L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f For n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f For n=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f For n=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f For n=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f For n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect! The formula works for all the layers I computed. So, instead of computing each layer step by step, I could have directly used this formula for L_9, which is the outermost layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9. So, substituting n=9 into the formula: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as before. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier result. This shows that recognizing the pattern and finding a closed-form solution can save a lot of time, especially if the number of layers were larger. However, since there are only nine layers, manually computing each layer wasn't too bad, but it's good to know the general approach in case the problem scales up. In summary, by either iteratively computing each nested layer or by finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, I arrived at the same final answer: 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. Let me verify each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the layers check out. So, I think my final answer is correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have simplified the process. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks similar to a geometric series or maybe a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We know that L_1 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B. Also, let's consider the homogeneous part: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f. It seems to work! So, in general, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's a good confirmation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my previous result. So, using both the iterative method and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. This gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations, but just to be absolutely sure, let me recompute 3*29524. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I've solved it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating it from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer simplifies to a value that's used in the next outer layer. By iteratively computing each layer or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation, the final result is found to be 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, 29524 is a 5-digit number, so when multiplied by 3, it should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me count the digits as I go:\n\nStarting from the right:\n1. Units place: 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n2. Tens place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n3. Hundreds place: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n4.

Hundred-thousands place: 5\u00d73=15 +2=17 \u2192 write 7, carry 1.\nWait, but 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4. So, digits are:\nPosition: 5 4 3 2 1\nDigits:    2 9 5 2 4\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524 \u00d7 3:\n- 4 \u00d7 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 +1=7 \u2192 7, no carry.\n- 5 \u00d7 3 =15 \u2192 5, carry 1.\n- 9 \u00d7 3 =27 +1=28 \u2192 8, carry 2.\n- 2 \u00d7 3 =6 +2=8 \u2192 8, no carry.\n\nSo, writing it down from right to left: 2, 7, 5, 8, 8. Wait, that gives 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. So, 29524 \u00d73 =88572.\n\nWait, but when I did it step by step before, I thought it was 88572, which matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when I do these step-by-step, I might have missed a digit.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 \u00d7 3 as (30000 - 476) \u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that seems a bit off. Wait, 30000 - 476 is 29524, so 29524 \u00d73 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 29524 =88572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed each layer, I got Layer 9 as 29524, so the entire expression is 3 \u00d729524 =88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again quickly:\n\nLayer 1:1+3=4\nLayer 2:1+3\u00d74=1+12=13\nLayer 3:1+3\u00d713=1+39=40\nLayer 4:1+3\u00d740=1+120=121\nLayer 5:1+3\u00d7121=1+363=364\nLayer 6:1+3\u00d7364=1+1092=1093\nLayer 7:1+3\u00d71093=1+3279=3280\nLayer 8:1+3\u00d73280=1+9840=9841\nLayer 9:1+3\u00d79841=1+29523=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, each layer is computed correctly, and then the final step is 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression in another way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3\u00d7(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 =1+3=4, a_2=1+3a_1, etc.\n\nThis looks like a recursive sequence where a_n =1 + 3a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nLet me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n =3a_{n-1} +1, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C =3C +1 \u2192 C -3C =1 \u2192 -2C=1 \u2192 C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1=4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) \u2192 4 =3A -1/2.\n\nSolving for A: 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 \u2192 A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, the 9th layer is indeed 29524.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3\u00d729524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the outermost expression is 3\u00d7a_9, which is 3\u00d7(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a specific pattern. Using a recursive approach and verifying with a closed-form formula, we determine that the outermost expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which seems consistent. I also double-checked the final multiplication, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). That would be 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. Sometimes when I do multiple layers, it's easy to slip up. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I could use instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about this. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which resembles a geometric series or something similar. Let me try to model this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L_1. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, I can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L_n, which would allow me to compute the value without manually calculating each layer. Let's see. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. When n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3*C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2})/2 - 1/2 = 9/2 - 1/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3)/2 - 1/2 = 27/2 - 1/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4)/2 - 1/2 = 81/2 - 1/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5)/2 - 1/2 = 243/2 - 1/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. For n=5: L_5 = (3^6)/2 - 1/2 = 729/2 - 1/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. So, the formula works for the first few layers. Therefore, I can use this formula to compute Layer 9 directly. Let's compute L_9: L_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = 59049/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation\u2014I arrive at the same result. This makes me confident that the answer is correct. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me write this down step by step so I don't lose track.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression starts with a 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So, after computing Layer 9, which is the innermost part, we go outward. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, there are 9 layers in total, each adding a 3*(...). Therefore, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, that would be the value inside the outermost parentheses, right? But wait, no, because each layer is inside the next. Let me clarify: The innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524\n\nSo, Layer 9 is the innermost part, and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, that can't be because the outermost is 3*(...). Let me check the structure again.\n\nWait, the expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...), which in turn is 1 + 3*(...), and so on. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*Layer1, Layer3 is 1 + 3*Layer2, etc., up to Layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). Wait, no, because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which includes Layer9 as the innermost part. So, actually, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer9). So, after computing Layer9 as 29524, the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 * 3. Let me calculate that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 29524 *3=88572. Therefore, the total expression is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because this seems a bit high. Let me verify each layer again:\n\nLayer1: 1 +3=4\n\nLayer2:1 +3*4=13\n\nLayer3:1 +3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1 +3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1 +3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1 +3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1 +3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1 +3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nYes, that seems correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, okay, that seems to be the answer. But just to be sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a recurrence relation. So, if I can find a closed-form solution for Layer n, it might save time and reduce errors. Let's see. The recurrence relation is:\n\nLayer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1)\n\nWith Layer1 = 4\n\nWait, no, actually, Layer1 is 4, which is 1 +3. Then Layer2 is 1 +3*4=13, Layer3=1 +3*13=40, etc.\n\nSo, the general form is Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1)\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The homogeneous solution would be Layer n = A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let me assume a particular solution of the form C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is Layer n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, Layer1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A -1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2\n\nSimplify: Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nNow, since we have 9 layers, Layer9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, Layer9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524\n\nWhich matches what I calculated earlier. So, Layer9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more because sometimes when dealing with exponents, it's easy to miscount. Let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049-1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Okay, I think that's correct. Let me just see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLooking back at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something, which is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. But in this case, it's a bit different because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, which is similar to a recurrence relation, as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as S, then S = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)))) with nine layers. But since each layer is similar, maybe I can express S in terms of itself, but I think that might complicate things more since S is only the outermost layer.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3. Adding those up: 300 + 60 = 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. Adding them: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. Adding those: 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Let's do it step by step: 29524 * 3. Starting from the right: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. So, putting it all together: 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's right. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. The expression seems to be a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can model this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. It seems like each term is a linear function of the previous term. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. Let's try to find a pattern or recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve this, I can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3*A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since the original expression has 9 layers, that means the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That's the same result I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, using both the step-by-step computation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer. This makes me confident that 88572 is the correct result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by repeatedly evaluating from the innermost parentheses outward.

Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121: Let me compute that. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3; so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364.

Now, 3*9841: Let me calculate that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.

Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841 (correct). Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524 (correct). Then, 3*29524=88572 (correct). Okay, so I think that's the right answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. Each layer is defined by the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try that. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, let's assume the solution is of the form L_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Now, equate both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B Subtract B from both sides: 0 = 1 + 2B => 2B = -1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3}-1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. Okay, so the formula works. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I used two methods: direct computation layer by layer and solving the recurrence relation, both leading to the same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Wow, this is growing quickly. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Okay, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Okay, so Layer 9 gives us 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the outermost 3 times that: 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have helped me avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, perhaps? Let me recall how to solve recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. Perfect, the formula works. So, a_9 = 29524, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. Plugging in n=9: (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to compute it without going through each layer step by step. That might have been a more efficient method, but since I was able to compute each layer manually without errors, both methods lead to the same answer. Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the step-by-step approach. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\\) with \\(a_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence, we find that \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For the ninth layer, \\(a_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Now, moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Next, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279.

So, adding those up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, I see a pattern emerging. Let me write down each layer as I go along to see if there's a quicker way or a formula I can apply. Layer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nWait, let me check that again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The original problem is 3 times the entire expression, right? So after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost expression inside the parentheses, we need to multiply that result by 3. So, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me recount the layers to see how many times I need to do this. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let's see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) I can count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Let me see: Each time I see a \"(\", that's a new layer. Let me count them:\n\n1. 3(1+3(...\n2. ...3(1+3(...\n3. ...3(1+3(...\n4. ...3(1+3(...\n5. ...3(1+3(...\n6. ...3(1+3(...\n7. ...3(1+3(...\n8. ...3(1+3(...\n9. ...3(1+3))\n\nWait, so actually, there are nine layers of parentheses here. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9, which is the outermost expression. Then, the entire result is multiplied by 3. So, after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply that by 3 to get the final answer. Let me go through each layer step by step to make sure I don't make any calculation errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600, +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let me break this down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original problem is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with large numbers. Let me verify each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 4 (correct)\nLayer 2: 13 (correct)\nLayer 3: 40 (correct)\nLayer 4: 121 (correct)\nLayer 5: 364 (correct)\nLayer 6: 1093 (correct)\nLayer 7: 3280 (correct)\nLayer 8: 9841 (correct)\nLayer 9: 29524 (correct)\nThen, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer step by step, but since the expression is only nine layers deep, it's manageable to compute each one manually. Alternatively, this kind of nested expression might be similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that for a moment. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. It might be possible to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nLet me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2)\n4 = 3A - 1/2\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the known values to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we can compute it as:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. So that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is a_9 = 29524, and then the entire problem is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, and the recursive formula checks out with the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). After computing each layer, we multiply the outermost result by 3.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.

Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000+2523=29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524.

It might be a geometric series or something, but given the structure, each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), which is a linear recurrence. However, since it's only nine layers, computing each step was manageable. If it were more layers, maybe I'd look for a pattern or a formula, but for nine, this step-by-step approach worked.

Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Let's break it down: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, adding them together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let's do that. 29524 * 3. Let me break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524: Let's compute it again. 29524 * 3. 2*3 is 6, 9*3 is 27, 5*3 is 15, 2*3 is 6, 4*3 is 12. Wait, maybe I should do it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, reading it from top: 8,7,8,5,2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 *3 is 88572. Let me verify: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. Next: 9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. Finally, 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the number is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Each step seems to build on the previous one, and I didn't see any errors in my calculations when I went through each layer. So, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the final result is 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's getting bigger quickly. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original problem is 3*(...). So, the final computation would be 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Therefore, the final result should be 88,572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f Okay, that seems consistent. Each layer checks out, and the multiplication at the end is correct. So, I think 88,572 is the right answer. Alternatively, I wonder if there's a formula or a pattern that could have helped me compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Maybe recognizing this as a geometric series or something similar? Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, I believe. Let me recall the formula for solving linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where in this case, c=3 and d=1. The solution is a_n = (a_0 - d/(1 - c)) * c^n + d/(1 - c). Wait, but in our case, the first term is a_1 = 4, which is Layer 1. So, maybe we can model it starting from n=1. Let me adjust the formula accordingly. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say P. Plugging into the recurrence: P = 3*P + 1 => P - 3P = 1 => -2P = 1 => P = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f Perfect, the formula works for the first few layers. So, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9, which is the innermost layer in our original problem, corresponds to n=9? Wait, no, let's see. Wait, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3, which we computed as 4. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is 13, and so on up to Layer 9. So, in our formula, a_n corresponds to Layer n. So, Layer 9 is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572, as before. So, using the formula, I can compute the value without having to go through each layer manually. That's pretty efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger. But in this case, since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression in terms of exponents of 3. Let me try expanding the expression step by step to see if I can find a pattern. Starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3 + 1. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 = 3^3 - 1? Wait, 3^3 is 27, which is more than 13. Hmm, maybe not. Let me compute a few more layers and see if I can spot a pattern. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 = 3^1 + 1? No, 3^1 is 3, plus 1 is 4. So, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. 3^2 + 1 = 9 + 1 =10 \u226013. Hmm, not quite. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40. 3^3 +1=27 +1=28 \u226040. Not matching. Wait, but from the formula earlier, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 1: (3^{2} -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: (3^3 -1)/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: (3^4 -1)/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f So, that seems to hold. So, in general, each layer is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2=29,524. So, the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, perhaps the entire expression can be represented as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let me compute that: 3*( (59,049 -1)/2 )= 3*(59,048/2)=3*29,524=88,572. So, that's another way to think about it. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think I'm confident with this answer now because I've computed it step by step, checked each layer, derived a formula, and confirmed it using the formula. It's always good to cross-verify, especially with nested expressions like this, because it's easy to make a multiplication error or miscount the layers. But since all methods point to the same result, I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression.

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524.

Adding those up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, the final result is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication.

Now, computing 3*29524:\n\nLet me try another way: 29524 * 3.\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nNo more digits, so write down 2.\n\nWait, that would be:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2*3=6 +1=7 \u21927, carry 0\n5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928, carry 0\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but when I did it earlier, I thought of it as 20000+9000+500+20+4, but that's not the standard way. Let me confirm using another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n29,524\n= 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4\nSo, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's consistent. So, the total is 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed 3*29,524 earlier, I thought it was 88,572, but when I did it digit by digit, I thought it was 88,572 as well. So, that seems correct.\n\nLet me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Maybe I can check a couple of them.\n\nFor example, Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, all the layers check out. So, the final computation is 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. So, each time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, and then doing that again. It's like a geometric series, but in a nested form. Maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression.\n\nWait, I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using a formula. Let me think about that. Suppose we have a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). If we have n layers, what's the value?\n\nLet me denote the value after k layers as V_k. So, V_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nV_2 = 1 + 3*V_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nV_3 = 1 + 3*V_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to V_9.\n\nWait, so each V_k = 1 + 3*V_{k-1}, with V_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is V_k = 3*V_{k-1} + 1, with V_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is V_k = A*3^k + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug the recurrence into the equation:\n\nV_k = 3*V_{k-1} + 1.\n\nSubstitute V_{k} = A*3^k + B:\n\nA*3^k + B = 3*(A*3^{k-1} + B) + 1\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n3*(A*3^{k-1}) + 3*B + 1 = A*3^k + 3B + 1\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nA*3^k + B = A*3^k + 3B + 1\n\nSubtract A*3^k from both sides:\n\nB = 3B + 1\n\nThen, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2.\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. When k=1, V_1=4.\n\nV_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nThus, A = (9/2)/3 = (9/2)*(1/3) = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general formula is V_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2.\n\nSimplify that: V_k = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nWhich can be written as V_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check if this formula works for the layers I've already computed.\n\nFor k=1: V_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=2: V_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=3: V_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=4: V_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=5: V_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=6: V_6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=7: V_7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=8: V_8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nk=9: V_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, the value after 9 layers is V_9 = 29,524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*V_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29,524 again:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n20,000 *3=60,000\n\n9,000 *3=27,000\n\n500 *3=1,500\n\n20*3=60\n\n4*3=12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since V_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*V_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11} -3 =177147 -3=177144\n\nThen, (177144)/2=88,572.\n\nYes, that's the same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and working from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 Let me calculate that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.

Calculating 3*1093: Let's see, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). That's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). So 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121.

Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; total is 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279 = 3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 123 = 29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct. Now, 3*29524. Let's compute it again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series, but each term is being multiplied by 3 and then adding 1. Let me see if I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, for n > 1, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. The solution to such a recurrence relation is given by L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. Wait, but in this case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula would be L_n = a^{n} * (L_1 - d) + d, where d is the particular solution. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. Let me recall the method. The recurrence is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost parentheses is layer 9, so L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the recurrence relation and finding a closed-form formula actually confirms the step-by-step calculation. That's reassuring. Alternatively, maybe I could have noticed that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), so it's a geometric progression with a ratio of 3, but each term adds 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, but with an additional 1 added each time. The formula I derived earlier fits this scenario, so it's a valid approach. Another way to think about it is that each layer is effectively 3^{n} times the initial term plus some sum of the constants added. But I think the recurrence relation approach is the most straightforward here. So, in conclusion, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I arrived at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\) with \\(L_1 = 4\\).

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nOkay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nGot it, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, plugging in Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nAlright, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nHmm, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\nWait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me compute 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. Wait, but let me verify my steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make any errors. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3*B. So, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3*B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods lead me to the same result, which is reassuring. I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Let me compute that: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's a jump. Let me check that again. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yeah, that seems right. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Okay, 120 plus 1 is 121. That makes sense. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that. 3 times 121 is... 363, right? So, 1 + 363 = 364. Got it. Layer 5 is 364. Next, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Moving on to Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, and 80*3 is 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the innermost part is Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9. So, the value inside the outermost parentheses is Layer 9, which we just calculated as 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.

So, yes, 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. But just to be thorough, maybe I should verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define a sequence a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. Then, the expression we're computing is 3*a_9. So, if I can find a general formula for a_n, that might save time instead of computing each term individually. Let's see if we can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the previous layer.

Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: that's 39. So Layer 3: 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, interesting. So far, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 13, Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4: 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. So Layer 5: 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Therefore, Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Therefore, Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication. 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, and 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer step by step, and then multiplied the outermost layer by 3. Each step involved multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. The numbers got pretty big, but by breaking it down, it was manageable. I think I did each multiplication correctly. Let me verify one or two steps to be sure. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That's correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000+27000=87000; 87000+1500=88500; 88500+60=88560; 88560+12=88572. Yep, that's correct.

Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Let me do this step by step. 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we need to compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are right. It's a bit tedious with all those layers, but taking it step by step worked. I guess another way to look at it is recognizing that each layer is following a pattern, maybe even a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. That seems like a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write it as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. Simplifying that, a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check if that works for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I've got it right. So, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.

Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3*29524.

Let's compute 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially with the larger numbers. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. That seems correct. So, I think my final answer is 88572.

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Let me write that down. Layer 3 would then be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first. 3*10 is 30, and 3*3 is 9, so 30 + 9 = 39. Then add 1: 39 + 1 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 3*100 = 300, 3*20 = 60, and 3*1 = 3. So, 300 + 60 + 3 = 363. Then add 1: 363 + 1 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 = 900, 3*60 = 180, 3*4 = 12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*90 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*200 = 600, 3*80 = 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*40 = 120, and 3*1 = 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct.

Correct.\n\nSo, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. But let me double-check this because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount the layers or make a multiplication error. Let me recount the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, I computed Layer 1 through Layer 9 correctly. Each time, I computed the innermost first and worked outward. So, I think my approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. Let me think if there's a mathematical formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since I have to compute it for a small n (n=9), maybe it's faster to compute each term as I did. But for completeness, let me try to find a closed-form solution. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, Layer 1: n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, Layer 9: n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think this confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. It's reassuring to see that both methods give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\) starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). By solving the recurrence, we find a closed-form solution \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For \\( n = 9 \\), this yields \\( a_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. So, Layer 1 equals 4. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1092 + 1 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 9840 + 1 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. So, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.
