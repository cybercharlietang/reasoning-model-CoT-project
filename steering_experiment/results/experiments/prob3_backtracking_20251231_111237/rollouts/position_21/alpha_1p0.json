    "text": " Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9. L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait a minute, but the original expression is 3*(...). So after computing L9, which is the innermost part, we have to go back up each layer. Wait, no, actually, each layer is built upon the previous one. Let me make sure I'm not confusing the layers. Let me try again, maybe I miscounted the layers. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Let's compute that first: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Then: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Then: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Then: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Wait, but let me double-check that because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me recount how many layers there are. Each \"1 +\" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent 1+3(...) is another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's see: After the first 3, there's a (1+3(...)), so each (1+3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of (1+3...). From the expression, it's: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, the first innermost is (1+3), then each next is another (1+3(...)). Let me count them: 1. (1+3) 2. (1+3(1+3)) 3. (1+3(1+3(1+3))) ... and so on, up to nine layers. Wait, but in the expression, the innermost is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1+3(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the number of layers is 9, because each (1+3 is a new layer, starting from the innermost. So, I think my initial calculation was correct, but let me go through each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. Let's list them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, so:\n\nTotal = 3 * 29524 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 88,572, but when I first calculated, I thought it was 88,572. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when you do multiple layers, you might have missed a step. Let me verify each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524=88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the layers because the original expression has nine layers, but when I started, I thought it was nine, but when I wrote them out, it's Layer 1 to Layer 9, which is correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when I do these step-by-step computations, I might have missed a layer or added an extra. Let me count the number of times I have \"1 + 3(\" in the original expression.\n\nLooking back: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each time, 1+3(...) is added. Let me count the number of times I have 1+3(...). It's from the innermost to the outermost, so:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n4. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))\n5. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))\n6. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))\n7. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))\n8. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))\n9. Outermost: 1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) which is multiplied by 3.\n\nWait, so that's nine layers, each adding another 1+3(...). So, my initial calculation of nine layers is correct, and each layer is computed as above. Therefore, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, this is a recurrence relation where each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, since we have nine layers, n=9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nThis matches my earlier step-by-step computation, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an added 1 each layer.\n\nBut using the recurrence relation approach seems more straightforward and confirms the result.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each layer step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Let's call the innermost expression as Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1's value: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, plugging in Layer 2's value: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, okay, so each layer is building up. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, after computing Layer 9, which is the innermost expression, we have to go back to the original problem. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, let me check that again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's do that step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it together: 88572. Wait, that seems high, but let me verify. Alternatively, 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, yes, 88,572. So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recap the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check Layer 8 again: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840, plus 1 is 9841. That's correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Wait, that's different from what I had before. Wait, 9841*3: Let's compute 9841*3 properly.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, carry over 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, carry over 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29.\n\nSo, writing it down: 29,523.\n\nWait, so Layer 9 is 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, 3*29,524: Let's compute that.\n\n29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88,572. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did 9841*3, I thought it was 29,523, but 9841*3 is indeed 29,523, right? Because 9,000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400, +120=29,520, +3=29,523. So, 9841*3=29,523, then 1 + 29,523=29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29,524*3: Let's do it another way. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000, 9,000*3=27,000, 500*3=1,500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's breaking it down differently. Wait, 29,524 is 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20,000*3=60,000, 9,000*3=27,000, 500*3=1,500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, add them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +60=88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute this using a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's a repeated application of the operation 1 + 3*(...). So, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nLet me plug in the initial condition to find B.\n\nWhen n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B.\n\nBut we need another condition to find both A and B. However, since the recurrence is non-homogeneous, we can also find the particular solution.\n\nAlternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution, say a_n = C.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 up to a_9. Wait, no, actually, in the original expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is a_1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is a_9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which matches. For n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, which also matches. So, yes, the formula holds.\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as we got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's consistent.\n\nThen, the original problem is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that's the same result as before.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Wait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final result of the entire expression is 88572.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct.

Next layer: L3: 1 + 3(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, that's 40. L3 is 40. Then, L4: 1 + 3(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Wow, that's getting big. L4 is 121. Moving on to L5: 1 + 3(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 L5 is 364. Next, L6: 1 + 3(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 L6 is 1093. L7: 1 + 3(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 L7 is 3280.

    "text": " Let me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9. L1: 1 + 3 = 4. So, L1 is 4. Then, L2 is 1 + 3(L1). Since L1 is 4, L2 becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, L2 is 13. Now, L3 is 1 + 3(L2). Since L2 is 13, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. Therefore, L3 is 40. Moving on to L4: 1 + 3(L3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. L4 is 121. L5: 1 + 3(L4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. L5 is 364. L6: 1 + 3(L5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. L6 is 1093. L7: 1 + 3(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 1 + 3279 is 3280. L7 is 3280. L8: 1 + 3(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. L8 is 9841. L9: 1 + 3(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, L9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 multiplied by L9. So, that's 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Yep, that seems right. So, I think I've computed it correctly. Each layer builds on the previous one, and by carefully computing each step, I arrived at the final answer. I didn't skip any steps, and I double-checked each multiplication to ensure accuracy. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time worked well. I also considered whether there's a pattern or formula that could simplify this, but since each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous, it seems like each step just requires multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, no shortcuts there, just straightforward computation from the inside out. I think that's all.

Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so Layer 2 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Hmm, interesting. Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so Layer 4 = 1 + 120 = 121. Okay, moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so adding those up: 300+60=360, 360+3=363. Then, Layer 5 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Next, Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364.

Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000+2400=29400, 29400+120=29520, 29520+3=29523. So, Layer 9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, and 3*4=12. Now, adding all those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total expression equals 88572. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

So, writing it out: 29524 *3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. Next: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. Next: 2*3=6, write down 6. Finally, the leading digit: 2*3=6. So, putting it all together: 6 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that's 688572? Wait, that can't be right because 29524*3 is 88572, not 688572. Hmm, I think I messed up the place values when writing it out. Let me do it more carefully. Let's write 29524 as:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   x       3\n   -----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

Write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. So, that's correct. So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Okay, so I think my final answer is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any layers. The expression had nine layers of parentheses, each one adding 1 + 3*(previous layer). I computed each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, and then multiplied the outermost result by 3. Each step checked out, so I think I did it right. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next inner layer.

Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 equals 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 = 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 = let's see, 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093, let's compute that. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280, let's see, 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841.

Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

    "text": " Is the innermost expression 1 + 3? Let me check. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so total is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841. Let's break it down: 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Sometimes when I do multiple layers, I might have added something incorrectly. Let me go through each layer again quickly. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think. The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form formula. The recurrence is linear and homogeneous, so we can solve it using standard techniques. The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the solution is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a particular solution. Let me find the particular solution. Assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value step by step. Using a recurrence relation and solving it, we derive a closed-form formula, confirming the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's straightforward. So, the innermost expression is 4. Now, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got that, Layer 2 is 13. Next layer out: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving outward again: Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Next layer: Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Continuing outward: Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Next layer: Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, and 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Moving outward: Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, the outermost layer: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572.

Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 88,572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way or see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here.\n\nI notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote the value at each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L1.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on, up to L9.\n\nI can see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L0 would be undefined here, but in this case, L1 is the innermost.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSo, left side: A*3^n + B.\n\nRight side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSet equal:\n\nA*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B.\n\nSubtract A*3^n from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B.\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB - 3B = 1 \u2192 -2B = 1 \u2192 B = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L1 = 4.\n\nAt n=1: L1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier values to see if it works.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L6 = (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L7 = (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L8 = (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, L9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's correct. I double-checked each layer using both step-by-step computation and the general formula, and both methods gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation \\(L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1}\\), starting with \\(L_1 = 4\\). Solving this recurrence, we find a closed-form formula \\(L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). Applying this for \\(n = 9\\), we get \\(L_9 = 29524\\). Multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Maybe the innermost part is the last 1 + 3. So, let's compute that first. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Got that. Now, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, that's getting bigger each time. Let me keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Wait, hold on. The original expression is 3 times that Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is the Layer 9 expression. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, but let me double-check my computations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's compute it digit by digit: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, each layer is correct, and the final multiplication is correct. Therefore, the result is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have nine layers, perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about it. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to find a closed-form solution. First, let's write down the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, the outermost layer is layer 9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it using the formula, I could have directly used a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for n=9, giving 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

Wait, but the original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see: The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then inside it, there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...).

Let's see:\n\n- The outermost expression is 3*(...). Inside that, we have 1 + 3*(...).

Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(Layer 1), where Layer 1 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, actually, Layer 1 is the outermost layer, and Layer 9 is the innermost. So, to compute this, I need to compute Layer 9 first, then Layer 8, and so on, up to Layer 1, and then multiply by 3.\n\nLet me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 1).

Let me recount the layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer was computed correctly, and the multiplication at the end is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nIf I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nBut in this case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 is the innermost, and a_1 is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3.\n\nWait, actually, in my earlier computation, I considered Layer 9 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, and Layer 1 as the outermost, which is 1 + 3*a_2 = 29524.\n\nBut maybe there's a formula for a_n when a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for n=9 (since we have 9 layers), a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our earlier computation, we started with Layer 9 as the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which is a_1=4.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the problem, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, which we called Layer 9. But in the recurrence relation, a_1 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3=4.\n\nSo, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWait, that's exactly the value we got for Layer 1 in our earlier computation. That makes sense because in our earlier approach, Layer 1 was the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, which is a_1 in the recurrence relation. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused with the indices.\n\nWait, in our initial computation, we had:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*4 =13\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*13=40\n\n...\n\nLayer 1:1 +3*9841=29524\n\nSo, Layer 1 corresponds to a_9 in the formula because a_1 in the formula is the innermost layer, which is Layer 9 in our problem.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the formula, a_1 is the first term, which is the innermost layer: 1 + 3=4.\n\nThen a_2 is the next layer:1 +3*a_1=13.\n\na_3=1 +3*a_2=40.\n\n...\n\na_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}.\n\nSo, in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1=4, and the outermost layer is a_9=29524.\n\nThus, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nThis matches our step-by-step computation, so I'm confident that this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which can be represented as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. The formula we derived earlier gives a direct computation without having to calculate each layer individually, which is more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers.\n\nSo, in summary, by working from the innermost layer outward and either computing each layer step by step or using the derived formula, we arrive at the final result of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the expression is 88,572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Now, Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. That would be 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: Let's see, 120*3=360, and 1*3=3, so 360+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 = 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: Let's break it down. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 = 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. Adding them: 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, that would be 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or perhaps recognize a pattern. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let me see: Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.

Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original expression starts with 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524.

For a recurrence relation where each term is a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (c/(k-1))*(k^{n} - 1) + (a_0 - c/(k-1)))*k^{n}\n\nWait, in our case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so k=3, c=1, and a_0=1? Wait, actually, when n=1, a_1=4, which would be 1 + 3*1, so perhaps a_0=1, then a_1=1 + 3*a_0=4, etc.\n\nSo, the general solution for a_n where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me test that.\n\nFor n=0, a_0=1.\n\nn=1: a_1=3*1 +1=4. According to the formula: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9-1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=3*4 +1=13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=3*13 +1=40. Formula: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute a_9 using the formula and then multiply by 3.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the value after 9 layers, which we've computed as 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon the previous one. Using the formula for such a recurrence relation, we determine that the value after 9 layers is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. I can break it down as 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, let me verify that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in multiplication. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: 29524*3. Let's compute digit by digit: 4*3=12, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. 9*3=27, but wait, actually, the number is 29524. Wait, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\nx    3\n------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. I think that makes sense. Each layer was computed step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, and each time, I substituted the computed value into the next layer. I don't think I made any arithmetic errors, but just to be sure, let me check one or two layers again. Let's check Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Wait, no, that's Layer 8. Wait, Layer 7 was 1 + 3*3280, which is 1 + 9840, which is 9841. Wait, but earlier, I had Layer 8 as 9841, and Layer 9 as 29524. Wait, perhaps I mislabeled the layers. Let me recount. Wait, the original expression has nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that, so Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9. So, when I computed Layer 9, that's the innermost part, and then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the innermost is (1 + 3). So, actually, the number of layers is nine, each corresponding to one set of parentheses. So, perhaps I should have labeled Layer 1 as the innermost, and Layer 9 as the outermost. Let me recount the layers correctly. Let me try again, more carefully. The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then, moving outward, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think the answer is correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step follows logically from the previous one, and the arithmetic checks out.

Now, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Continuing this way, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the outermost part is 3 times the whole thing. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this easier instead of computing each layer step by step. I remember that expressions like this can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recurrence relation. Let's see if that applies here. Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. Let's say a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9. So, each term a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c). Let me see if I can find a particular solution. Let's assume the particular solution is a constant, say a_n = K. Then, K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K = 1 + 3K => 0 = 1 + 2K => K = -1/2. Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe it works. So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous solution + particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. At n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just check if I applied the formula correctly. Since each a_n is defined as 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have 9 layers, so n goes from 1 to 9. So, a_9 is the innermost part, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, if I didn't use the formula, I could have noticed that each layer is 1 more than three times the previous layer, which is exactly the recurrence relation. So, using the formula saved me from computing each layer manually, which is better for larger n, but in this case, since n is only 9, both methods worked. Either way, I arrived at the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each layer is defined as 1 plus three times the previous layer. By working from the innermost parentheses outward, we compute each layer step by step. Using a recurrence relation, we find that each layer can be represented by the formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). Applying this formula for the ninth layer and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

Let's compute that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; adding them up: 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.

Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240; adding them: 9000+600=9600, 9600+240=9840. So, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we take Layer 9, which is 29524, and multiply it by 3. Let's compute that: 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572.

Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2: 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4: 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5: 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7: 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let's compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.

Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that seems correct. Each layer was computed step by step, and the calculations add up.

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(...). So, perhaps the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is the innermost expression. Wait, no, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's compute each layer step by step. Let's compute layer by layer, starting from the innermost. Let me list them out:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the problem is 3*(Layer 9).

Let me go back and verify each layer.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me check how many layers there are. The problem is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" appears. Let's see:\n\nFrom the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each layer is 1+3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs. Let me write out the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, but in the problem, the expression is 3*(...), and inside, it's 1 + 3*(...), which itself has 1 + 3*(...), etc. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3*(...). Let me see:\n\nFrom the innermost, starting at the end:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, moving outward, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, each time I go one layer out, I add another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times this happens. Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3.\n\nThen, moving outward:\n\n1 + 3*(1+3)\n\n1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1+3))\n\nAnd so on, until we have 9 layers. Wait, but in the problem, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each \"1+\" is followed by a 3*(...), and each of those has another \"1+\" inside. Let me see:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of \"1+\" after the first 3.\n\nAfter the first 3, we have:\n\n1+3(...), and each (...) contains another 1+3(...). So, how many times does this happen? Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's the first layer.\n\nThen, moving outward, each time we have another 1+3*(...), so:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1+3*(Layer8)\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)\n\nWait, but in the problem, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), which itself has 1 + 3*(...), etc. So, the number of layers is 9, as each \"1+\" is a new layer.\n\nWait, but when I computed up to Layer9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. But let me make sure that I have the correct number of layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern.\n\nLet me think about it. Each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Let me try to solve it.\n\nWe have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to compute each term step by step, as I did before, but maybe I can find a formula.\n\nAlternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*previous, it's similar to a geometric series.\n\nLet me see: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nSo, expanding:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*L_{n-2}\n\nContinuing this way, we can see that:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n * L_0\n\nWait, but L_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1, so perhaps L_0 = 1? Let me check.\n\nIf n=1: L_1 = 1 + 3*L_0\n\nGiven L_1 =4, so 4 =1 + 3*L_0 => L_0 = (4-1)/3 = 1.\n\nSo, yes, L_0=1.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nWait, let me check that.\n\nBecause the recurrence L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThe particular solution can be found as a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition L_0 =1:\n\n1 = C*3^0 -1/2 => 1 = C -1/2 => C= 3/2.\n\nThus, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that L_9 is indeed the value inside the outermost 3*(...). Yes, because the expression is 3*(L_9).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in the exponentiation.\n\n3^10 is indeed 59,049 because 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nYes, so 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524.\n\nThen, 29524 *3: Let's compute 29,524 *3.\n\n29,524 *3:\n\n20,000 *3 =60,000\n\n9,000 *3=27,000\n\n500 *3=1,500\n\n20 *3=60\n\n4 *3=12\n\nAdding them up:\n\n60,000 +27,000=87,000\n\n87,000 +1,500=88,500\n\n88,500 +60=88,560\n\n88,560 +12=88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with the formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer follows the pattern L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence relation, we find that the innermost expression evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. So Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 13 Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. Let me calculate that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3: 40 Now, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4: 121 Moving on to Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5: 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 364 * 3. Let me do that multiplication step by step. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 + 12 = 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6: 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9.

So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8: 9841 Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 is a bit larger. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9: 29524 Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572.

    "text": " Let's consider the innermost expression as Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Now, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Calculating 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total is 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so let's compute that: 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a minute, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes when I do multiple layers, it's easy to slip up. Let me go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. Let me check the multiplication again: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, writing it down: 29524 *3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are right. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1.

So, Layer 2 equals 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Next, Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so adding those together: 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. So, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.

Hmm, that seems right, but let me confirm the multiplication: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that approach might not be accurate because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression. Let me think about that. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, this looks like each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, it's a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find A and B. Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, let's assume L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplifying the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form expression is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. Good, so the formula works. Therefore, the nth layer L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. So, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. Wait, just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested sequence that can be evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), which forms a geometric progression. Solving this recurrence relation gives a closed-form formula, and computing the outermost layer results in the final value.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let's consider the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4. Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121 first. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 364*3. Let me compute that: 300*3 = 900, 60*3 = 180, 4*3 = 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 = 3000, 90*3 = 270, 3*3 = 9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 = 9000, 200*3 = 600, 80*3 = 240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 = 27000, 800*3 = 2400, 40*3 = 120, 1*3 = 3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 = 29520, plus 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 = 88500, plus 60 = 88560, plus 12 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. It seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one without any errors in the multiplication or addition. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. I guess another way to approach this could be to recognize a pattern or formula, but since the expression is finite and only nine layers deep, computing each layer step by step is manageable. If it were infinitely nested, we might need a different approach, like solving for a variable in a recursive equation, but here, brute-force computation works. It's a good exercise in careful arithmetic and attention to detail to ensure each step is correct before moving on to the next. So, yeah, after computing each layer one by one, I arrive at the final answer of 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, okay, so Layer 3 is 40. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093.

Let me do it digit by digit. 29524 * 3: 4*3 is 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3 is 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3 is 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3 is 6, plus 2 is 8. 2*3 is 6. So putting it all together: 6, 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. Maybe I should compute 29524 * 3 step by step. Let's write it out:\n\n     29524\n   x      3\n   --------\n     ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Wait, let me confirm that: 29524 * 3. Let's do it another way. 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 = 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Okay, so that's correct. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Each step seems to follow logically, and I double-checked the multiplication at the end. I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting with the innermost layer:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me call the innermost part Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 3*100=300, 3*20=60, 3*1=3, so total is 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*90=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*200=600, 3*80=240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with such large numbers. Let's go through each layer again quickly: Layer 1: 1+3=4 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 2: 1+3*4=13 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 3: 1+3*13=40 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 4: 1+3*40=121 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 5: 1+3*121=364 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841 \u2714\ufe0f Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524 \u2714\ufe0f Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. Let's break it down digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. Wait, that's different from my previous total. Wait, hold on, I must have made a mistake earlier. Wait, no, let me check: When I did 3*29524, I did 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*20=60, 3*4=12. Adding those: 60000 +27000=87000, +1500=88500, +60=88560, +12=88572. But when I did it digit by digit, I got 88572 as well. Wait, but when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572. So both methods give me 88572. So, that must be correct. Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought of 3*29524 as 3*(29000 + 524) = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I think my final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me check if I correctly identified the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost, each time it's 1+3(...). Let's see:\n\n1. Innermost: 1+3\n2. Next: 1+3(1+3)\n3. Next: 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost one. Let me count the number of 1+3(...). Let's see: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer wraps around that. So, starting from the innermost, we have Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*4=13\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572\n\nSo, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nSo, a_1=4\n\na_2=1+3*4=13\n\na_3=1+3*13=40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3a_{n-1}=0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nAt n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2\n\nSo, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572, which is the same as before. So, that confirms that my answer is correct.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives us 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.

So, 3*29524. Let's compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2 and carry over 1. 2*3=6, plus 1 is 7. 5*3=15, write down 5 and carry over 1. 9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8 and carry over 2. 2*3=6, plus 2 is 8. 2*3=6.

So, 88572. Wait, but 29524 * 3 is actually 88572. Let me check with another method to confirm. 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. So, the total expression is 88,572.

Let's do this step by step:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7.\n\n5*3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\nNow, the next digit is 2 (from 29524, which is the ten-thousands place), so 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88572.\n\nWait, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 =12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carry 2.\n\nNow, the next digit is 2 (the ten-thousands place), so 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me verify using another method. Maybe I can break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 +4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12\n\nNow, adding these up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 +60 = 88560\n\n88560 +12= 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*(Layer 9) = 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check if I correctly identified the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... nine times...))). So, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in computing each Layer. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 (correct)\n\nLayer 3: 1 +3*13=1 +39=40 (correct)\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 (correct)\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 (correct)\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 (correct)\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 (correct)\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 (correct)\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 (correct)\n\nSo, each layer seems correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way, perhaps using a formula for a geometric series or something like that, since each layer is 1 +3*previous, which resembles a geometric progression.\n\nLet me think. The expression is built as follows: each time, it's 1 +3*(the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 +3, then 1 +3*(1 +3), etc. So, in general, for n layers, the value is 1 +3*(value of n-1 layers). So, if I denote a_n as the value of n layers, then a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nWait, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, for n=9, a_9=29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try to find a recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n =1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, whose characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C => C -3C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches what I found earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the solution is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it both by iterative computation and by solving the recurrence relation, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, we can compute each layer step by step. Using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, we find the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). There are nine such layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\nNow, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on. The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems quite large. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made an error somewhere. Let me go through each layer again step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192. 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279. 3000 + 279 = 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840. 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523. 27000 + 2523 = 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524. Let's compute this again to make sure:\n\n29524 * 3:\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Maybe it's better to compute it as:\n\n29524 * 3:\n= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72\nNow, adding them up:\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 72 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but I just thought, is the expression 3*(Layer 9) or is Layer 9 the innermost? Let me check the original problem again. The original problem is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each layer wraps around that. So, Layer 1: 1+3=4\n\nLayer 2: 1+3*(Layer1)=1+12=13\n\nLayer3: 1+3*13=40\n\nLayer4:1+3*40=121\n\nLayer5:1+3*121=364\n\nLayer6:1+3*364=1093\n\nLayer7:1+3*1093=3280\n\nLayer8:1+3*3280=9841\n\nLayer9:1+3*9841=29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*29524=88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach. Let's see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), and each time it's multiplied by 3, perhaps there's a geometric series involved or some recursive formula.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation can be found using the method for solving linear recurrences. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence.\n\nFirst, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nSolving for A: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computations.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 again:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Let's do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n\u00d7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\n-------\nLet's compute digit by digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 88,572.\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n\n5 \u00d7 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 \u00d7 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88,572.\n\nBut wait a second, when I computed L9, I got 29,524, and then 3 \u00d7 29,524 is 88,572. So, the final result should be 88,572.\n\nBut let me make sure I computed each L correctly, because if I messed up any layer, the subsequent layers will be wrong.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, then 3 \u00d7 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again because 29,524 \u00d7 3.\n\nAlternatively, 29,524 \u00d7 3 can be broken down as:\n\n29,524 \u00d7 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) \u00d7 3\n\n= 20,000 \u00d7 3 + 9,000 \u00d7 3 + 500 \u00d7 3 + 20 \u00d7 3 + 4 \u00d7 3\n\n= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding these together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3 \u00d7 29,524 is indeed 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has how many layers?\n\nLooking back at the problem: $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\nI can count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the first 3, the expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach \"1 + 3(...)\" is a layer. Let me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, each of my L1 to L9 corresponds to each of these layers. So, starting from L1 = 1 + 3, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1, up to L9 = 1 + 3*L8, and then the entire expression is 3*L9. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier computation, I computed L9 as 29,524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. So, that should be the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, L9 is indeed 29,524.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me count the number of times \"1 + 3(\" appears. Each time, it's a new layer.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nThe innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n- The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...))\n- Inside that, another 1 + 3*(...)\n- This continues until the innermost 1 + 3.\n\nSo, let's count the number of \"1 + 3(\" instances:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(\n2. 1 + 3(\n3. 1 + 3(\n4. 1 + 3(\n5. 1 + 3(\n6. 1 + 3(\n7. 1 + 3(\n8. 1 + 3(\n9. 1 + 3(\n\nWait, that's 9 layers. So, L1 to L9, as I did earlier. So, 9 layers, each adding another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula for such nested expressions. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar.\n\nLet me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis kind of recurrence can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a general formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is linear and can be expressed as:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nC = 3*C + 1\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nSolving for A:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula for a_n is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct.\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as computed earlier.\n\nThus, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} to confirm.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3^{10} is 59,049. Then, (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. So, a_9 is indeed 29,524.\n\nTherefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\n3^{11} = 177,147\n\nSo, (177,147 - 3)/2 = 177,144/2 = 88,572. Yes, that's the same result.\n\nSo, that's another way to look at it: The entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 = 88,572.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a general formula, I'm confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given nested expression, we start by recognizing the repeating pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer \\( L_i \\) as follows:\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times L_1 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times L_2 \\)\n- ...\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times L_8 \\)\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n- \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n- \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n- \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n- \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n- \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n- \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n- \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n- \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\( 3 \\times L_9 \\):\n- \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me denote each layer as follows. Let's define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me think of it as a recursive sequence. Let\u2019s define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. f(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. f(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. f(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. f(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. f(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. f(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, the innermost layer f(1) is 4, and each subsequent layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. So, after computing up to f(9), we get 29524. But wait, the entire expression is 3 times this f(9), right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the total expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29000 is 87000, and 3*524 is 1572. So, adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from f(1) = 4, correct. f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13, correct. f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, correct. f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121, correct. f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364, correct. f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093, correct. f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, correct. f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, correct. f(9) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524, correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), which is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving it that way to confirm. The recurrence relation is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, with f(1) = 4. The homogeneous solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume f_p(n) = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 3*D + 1. Solving for D: D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition f(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3C => C = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5 = 3/2. Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could have recognized that each time we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which is similar to a geometric series, but because it's nested, it's a bit different. But the recursive approach seems to work well here. Let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors when computing 3*29524. Breaking it down: 29524 * 3. 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3: 2 9 5 2 4 *3: 4*3=12, so 2 with carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " Maybe the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let's compute that first. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, this is getting bigger quickly. Let's keep going. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

    "text": " Let's say Layer 1 is 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 = 4. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 = 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 = 900, 3*64 = 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me calculate 3*1093: 3*1000 = 3000, 3*93 = 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: Let's break it down. 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 is a large number. Let me do this step by step. 9841 * 3: 9000*3 = 27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, 3*9841 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Layer 9 = 29,524. Now, remember that the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, we have 3*29,524. Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3: Let's break it down. 20,000*3 = 60,000; 9,000*3 = 27,000; 500*3=1,500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524. Correct. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of Layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, I notice that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me test this. Suppose L_n = A*3^{n} + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, we have A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fractional value, which is fine. So, B = -1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. At n=1, L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4. So, 3A - 1/2 = 4. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2. Simplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Alternatively, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier layers. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 is L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^{10} is 59,049. So, L_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's consistent. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. Let's see: The original expression is 3*(L_9). And L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Therefore, the original expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59,049. So, 59,049 - 1 = 59,048. Then, 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer, 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the formula checks out with the earlier layers, so I feel confident about this answer.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost outwards, we find that each layer follows a pattern leading to the final result. Using the formula derived from the recurrence relation, we determine the value of the innermost layer and multiply by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Recognize the nested structure where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n2. Compute each layer starting from the innermost:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is... let me compute that. 300*3 = 900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). 3*1093. Let me compute that: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So, Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280. Let's compute that: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841.

Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

    "text": " Let's define Layer 1 as the innermost part: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, moving out one layer, Layer 2 would be: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40.

Correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524=88572. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, so I don't have to compute each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, I can recognize it as a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, using the formula, I get the same result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using another approach, perhaps recognizing that each layer is a geometric progression. Let me think. Since each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), and we have nine layers, maybe we can express this as a sum of a geometric series. Let me try to write out the expression in terms of a series. Starting from the innermost layer: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this expansion, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0, where a_0 would be the base case if n=0. But in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, if I set n=9, then a_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^8 + 3^9*a_0. Wait, but a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3, so a_1 = 1 + 3*1, where 1 is the base case when n=0. So, perhaps a_0 = 1. Therefore, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*a_0. Since a_0=1, a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k. Wait, but that sum would be (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572. So, this approach also confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3^k for k from 0 to 8, plus the outermost 3. Let me try to write it out. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). Each layer adds a multiplication by 3 and an addition of 1. So, expanding it all the way, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1)...)). Wait, but the innermost term is 1 + 3, not 3*1. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust that. Wait, the innermost term is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, when I expand all the layers, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). If I expand this, it would be 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... + 3^9*1 + 3^{10}*1, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Wait, let me try to think recursively. Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). But this seems circular. Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've already established that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then E = 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same answer as before. So, that's another way to look at it. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. I think I've verified it enough ways, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer outward, each layer can be computed step by step. Using a recurrence relation or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series leads to the same result. The final answer is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using a formula or recognizing a pattern. Let me think about the structure of the expression. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. So, let's see if I can find a general formula for a_n. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me write it down: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for a_9, that would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}. I know that 3^5 = 243, so 3^10 = (3^5)^2 = 243^2. Let me compute 243^2: 243 * 243. Let's compute this step by step. 200*200 = 40,000 200*40 = 8,000 200*3 = 600 40*200 = 8,000 40*40 = 1,600 40*3 = 120 3*200 = 600 3*40 = 120 3*3 = 9 Now, adding all these up: 40,000 + 8,000 + 600 + 8,000 + 1,600 + 120 + 600 + 120 + 9. Let's add them step by step: 40,000 + 8,000 = 48,000 48,000 + 600 = 48,600 48,600 + 8,000 = 56,600 56,600 + 1,600 = 58,200 58,200 + 120 = 58,320 58,320 + 600 = 58,920 58,920 + 120 = 59,040 59,040 + 9 = 59,049. So, 3^10 = 59,049. Therefore, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. So, a_9 is 29,524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29,524 again. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 500 * 3 = 1,500 24 * 3 = 72 Now, adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach, like expanding the expression step by step without using the recurrence formula. Let's try that. Starting from the innermost parentheses: The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, we have 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Then: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Then: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Next: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Then: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(29,524) = 88,572. So, that's the same as before. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is the same. It seems that breaking down the problem step by step and computing each layer methodically leads me to the solution without any issues. I don't think I made any calculation errors because I've cross-verified each step, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm pretty confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with multiple layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3(\\text{previous layer})\\).

So Layer 4 is 121. Next, Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121. 121*3: 100*3=300, 20*3=60, 1*3=3, so 300+60+3=363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Moving on to Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Now, Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Next, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify that I didn't make any calculation errors, especially with such large numbers. Let me recheck each layer's computation to ensure accuracy. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, the final step: 3*29524. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Is there a 1 + 3 inside? Let me see: The innermost part is 1 + 3. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation would be: 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let me break it down: 29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. Calculating each part: 20000 * 3 = 60,000. 9000 * 3 = 27,000. 500 * 3 = 1,500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, adding them all together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. 88,500 + 60 = 88,560. 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88,572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscount with so many layers. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3 * 29524: Let me compute this again. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's do it digit by digit. 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it out: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that matches what I got before. So, I think my calculation is correct.
