Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I can also check with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds. For example, if there was only one layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 Using the formula: a_1 = 4, so 3*a_1 = 12, which is correct. If there are two layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 Using the formula: a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, then 3*a_2=39. Correct again.

By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer up to the ninth layer, resulting in a value of 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost:**\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3:**\n   - Final result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}."
