Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572.

Just to be thorough, let me check if my initial step-by-step computation of each layer was correct. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but just to be extra sure, let me verify the multiplication: 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12.

Therefore, the final answer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all nine layers, we find the value before the outermost multiplication is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. Thus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result.
