Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So, reading from top: 8,8,7,5,2. So, 88572. Wait, that seems high, but let me check: 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer would be 88,572. But let me double-check my computations for each layer because that's a lot of steps and I might have made an error somewhere.

So, I think I did this correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have saved some time, instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This resembles a geometric series but with a twist because each term is being multiplied by 3 and added 1. Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is built from the previous one. So, for example, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is what I got earlier. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, the general formula for a_n can be found using the method for solving linear recurrence relations. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, but in our problem, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, which would correspond to n=1. So, plugging n=1 into the general solution: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f. For n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f. Perfect, so this formula works. Therefore, the value of Layer 9, which is a_9, would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By solving each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the formula derived from solving the recurrence, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next digit:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's compute that: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572.

So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. So 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840. So 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. So 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, finally, 3 * 29524 = 88572.

Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I might consider whether there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote the innermost expression as a recurrence relation. Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the recurrence relation approach gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my steps because that's a lot of layers, and it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't miscalculate anywhere. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. Correct. Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. Correct.

Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use here instead of computing each layer step by step, which would be faster and reduce the chance of error. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 =4. This is a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. This is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C =1 +3*C. Solving for C: C -3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: a_1 = A*3^1 -1/2 =3A -1/2 =4. Solving for A: 3A =4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, the innermost layer is Layer 1, which is a_1=4, and the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula directly without computing each layer. Since the entire expression is 3*a_9, and a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. That's a more efficient way, using the formula, especially if the number of layers is large. But since I had to compute each layer step by step initially, it's good that I verified the formula works. So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and then verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds up to 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers, which would throw off the entire result.

Yes, that seems right. Hmm, but wait, let me see: Each time, we're doing 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is growing exponentially, which makes sense why the numbers get so big so quickly. Let me think if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It looks similar to a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1, maybe it's a recursive sequence. Let me define a recursive formula. Let\u2019s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Wait, but in my earlier computation, Layer 1 was 1 + 3, which is 4, so L_1 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n^{(h)} = 3*L_{n-1}^{(h)}, whose solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches my earlier computation. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just verify once more by computing each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Layer 1:1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer 3:1+3*13=40. Layer 4:1+3*40=121. Layer 5:1+3*121=364. Layer 6:1+3*364=1093. Layer 7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9:1+3*9841=29524. Multiply by 3:29524*3=88572. Yep, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer grows exponentially. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or find a pattern to compute it without expanding each layer, but since there are only nine layers, expanding each step is manageable. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for such expressions. Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. To solve this, we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the result.

This is a linear recurrence relation, and its solution can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 = 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Comparing both sides: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition L_1 = 4: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier layers to make sure it's correct. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9, which is L_9, would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is following a geometric progression. Since each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, it's similar to a geometric series. But in this case, since the expression is finite (nine layers), the formula I derived using the recurrence relation is more straightforward. So, in conclusion, the value of the given expression is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step layer computation and the formula using the recurrence relation give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\) where \\( L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1} \\) with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). We compute each layer step by step:\n\n- Layer 1: \\( L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( L_2 = 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( L_3 = 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( L_4 = 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( L_5 = 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( L_6 = 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( L_7 = 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( L_8 = 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( L_9 = 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

So putting it all together, 29524*3=88572. So, the final result is 88,572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems like a big number.

Then, 3*29524: Let's compute this again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So, the result is 88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression to avoid computing each layer manually. Let me think about it. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. This looks like a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3. Wait, but it's not exactly a geometric series because each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to this recurrence relation can be found using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. Wait, no, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. So, the homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the equation: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches the value I got earlier when computing each layer manually. So, that's reassuring. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's the final answer. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire expression in terms of 3^{10} or something, but since the problem just asks to compute it, 88572 is the numerical value. Let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the general solution. Let me test the formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, using the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually computing each layer. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing layer by layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms the result. Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4, and we have 9 layers, so n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11} - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572.

But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could have helped me compute this without calculating each layer step by step, in case I made an arithmetic mistake somewhere.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1 in this case.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1), where L_0 is the initial term. Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4, so perhaps we need to adjust the formula accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, the closed-form solution for L_n can be written as L_n = (b/(a-1)) + (L_1 - (b/(a-1))) * a^{n-1}.\n\nLet me verify that.\n\nGiven the recurrence L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, the solution is L_n = a^{n} * C + d, where d is a constant. To find d, set L_n = L_{n-1} = d, so d = a*d + b => d = b/(1 - a). Therefore, L_n = a^{n} * (L_0 - d) + d.\n\nIn our case, a=3, b=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo, d = 1/(1 - 3) = 1/(-2) = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = 3^{n} * (L_0 - (-1/2)) + (-1/2). Wait, but L_0 would be L_1's predecessor. Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, since L_1 is the first term, perhaps n starts at 1.\n\nAlternatively, let's write the general solution as L_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + C = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + C) + 1 => A*3^{n} + C = A*3^{n} + 3C + 1 => C = 3C + 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for L_1: n=1, L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor L_2: n=2, L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor L_3: n=3, L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nTherefore, using the closed-form formula, I also arrive at the same answer, which confirms that my step-by-step calculation was correct.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 88572. I didn't make any arithmetic errors in my calculations, and the closed-form formula corroborates the step-by-step result. So, I can conclude that the computed value is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Wait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer computation to check for errors. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think if I can find a pattern or a formula that could compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let's see, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n be the value of the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a first-order linear recurrence, maybe it's manageable. The recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose solution is a_n = C*3^n. Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 would be a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recurrence relation, or use the closed-form formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct. I think I've thoroughly checked each step, and the logic holds. So, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations for each layer because if I made a mistake in one layer, it could throw off the entire result. Let's go through each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nStarting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.

So, 9000 +840=9840. Then, 1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 +3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions that I can use to verify the result without computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The structure of the expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me consider the general form. Suppose we have an expression like a + 3*(a + 3*(a + 3*...))). If this repeats n times, maybe there's a formula for it. Let me try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression.\n\nLet me denote the innermost expression as x. Then, each layer can be represented as 1 + 3x. If we have multiple layers, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So, for n layers, it would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*...))) n times.\n\nWait, in our problem, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form solution for a_k. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence is a_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_k = C*3^k + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When k=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSo, 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer k, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor k=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor k=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nFor k=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nFor k=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, which is a_9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=59049*3=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, using the formula, I can directly compute the result without computing each layer step by step.\n\nThat's a good way to verify my answer. It's always reassuring to cross-check using a different method.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 +3*(previous layer). By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, I was able to derive a closed-form formula, which allowed me to compute the result more efficiently. Then, multiplying the 9th layer result by 3 gave me the final answer of 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or computations. Each step checks out, and the formula confirms the result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{88572}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we need to compute the nested expression:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe start by recognizing that each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. A particular solution can be found by assuming L_n^p = D. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D =1 => D= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition L_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier.

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't skip any or compute them incorrectly. Starting from the innermost: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually, which might save time and reduce errors. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to solve this recurrence. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form B. Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3*B + 1 => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. So, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. So, same result. Therefore, regardless of the method, the answer is 88572. I think that's thorough. I started by computing each layer step by step, then realized there's a pattern and derived a closed-form formula using recurrence relations, which confirmed the result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by computing each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. Let me verify each layer again step by step to make sure I didn't make any errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series because each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me see if that approach works. The expression inside is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression. Let me consider the innermost part first. Let's denote the innermost expression as a1: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, I could model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is built from the previous one. So, for n from 1 to 9, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1? Wait, no, because the innermost term is a1 = 1 + 3, which would correspond to a0 = 1, then a1 = 1 + 3*a0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4. Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So, actually, a0 = 1, a1 = 4, a2 = 13, a3 = 40, etc., up to a9. Then, the total expression is 3*a9. So, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition. When n=0, a0 = 1. So, 1 = A*3^0 + (-1/2) => 1 = A*1 - 1/2 => A = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=0: a0 = (3^{1} - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Correct. For n=1: a1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. For n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. For n=5: a5 = (3^6 -1)/2= (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. For n=6: a6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. For n=7: a7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. For n=8: a8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. For n=9: a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, the closed-form formula works perfectly. Therefore, a9 =29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. Therefore, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, since the outermost multiplication by 3 is just 3*a9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step, use the recurrence relation, or apply the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. Each step seems to be multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is a linear recurrence relation. I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of expression. Let me think. The general form is a nested expression where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence can be found using the formula for a linear recurrence. Specifically, this is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation of the first order. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K. Solving for K: K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Plugging into the general solution: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it holds. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572. So, that's correct. Alternatively, using the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I get the same answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, expanding this, a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is exactly our case. The solution to this recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. Let's see for n=1: a_1 = (3^1 -1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but in our case a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me try to solve the recurrence relation properly. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Which matches what I computed earlier. So, to find a general formula, let's consider the homogeneous solution and particular solution. The recurrence is linear and nonhomogeneous: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Substituting into the recurrence: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So yes, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for our problem, n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. For n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3*a_9 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same answer.

Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let L_n be the value of the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. So, L_n = A*3^n + B. Plugging in the recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute it step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we can break it down layer by layer, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6+1=7, write 7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6+2=8, write 8. So yes, 88572. So the final result is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since it's only nine layers, doing it manually isn't too bad. Let me think if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try solving the recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K=1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since the innermost layer is layer 1, and we have 9 layers in total, the outermost layer is layer 9. So, the value of the innermost expression before multiplying by the outermost 3 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, using the formula is a quicker way, but since I had to compute each layer step by step initially, that also worked. Either way, the final answer is 88,572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find the value of the innermost expression and then multiply by 3. Using the recurrence relation, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Thus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Wait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, right? Because starting from the innermost, which is layer 1, up to layer 9. Wait, but in the expression, the outermost is 3*(...), so perhaps the number of layers is 9. Let me check: The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. So, n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is a geometric series. Let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) which is similar to 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the sum can be expressed as a geometric series. But since I've already solved it step by step and confirmed with the recurrence relation, I think I'm good. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By evaluating each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the value of the innermost expression is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all layers, the outermost expression is 3 times the result of the ninth layer, leading to the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3: Each time, it's 1+3(...), so starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times '1+3(' appears. Let's see: Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of layers. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, inside each parenthesis, it's 1+3(...). Let's see how many layers: The innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more than the previous. So, starting from 1+3, that's the first layer. Then, moving out, each time you have another 1+3(...). Let's count how many layers there are. The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3( inside the expression. Starting from the first 1+3( after the first 3, then each subsequent 1+3( adds another layer. Let me count:\n\n1. 3(1+3(\n2.     1+3(\n3.         1+3(\n4.             1+3(\n5.                 1+3(\n6.                     1+3(\n7.                         1+3(\n8.                             1+3(\n9.                                 1+3(\n10.                                  1+3)\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, each time you have a 1+3(...), that's a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's layer 1. Then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, in the expression, how many 1+3( are there? Let's see:\n\nThe entire expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, inside the first 3(...), there are 9 instances of 1+3(...).

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each term is 1 plus 3 times the previous term. That seems recursive. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. The homogeneous solution would be solving a_n -3*a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p =1 +3*a_p => a_p -3*a_p=1 => -2*a_p=1 => a_p= -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. So, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.

    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, so units digit is 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, tens place is 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, hundreds place is 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, thousands place is 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, ten-thousands place is 8. So putting it together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check: 29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. Let me compute 29,524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*        3\n----------\n88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. Because 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 20 * 3 = 60; 4 * 3 = 12. Adding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. So, yes, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I computed Layer 9 as 29,524, I thought that was the value inside the parentheses, so the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572. So, is that the final answer? Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is correct. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, each subsequent layer adds one more 3*(...). So, if I have 9 layers, then the outermost would be Layer 9, which I computed as 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88,572. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might save time in case the number of layers is larger. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can compute it step by step for 9 layers, which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, recognizing that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be expanded as a geometric series.\n\nLet me try to find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n = 1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches a_1 = 4. Good.\n\nFor n = 2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches my earlier computation. Good.\n\nSimilarly, n = 3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40, correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn this problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the value after 9 layers. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute a_9: 3^{10} is 59,049. So, a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524, which matches my earlier computation.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponent. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^1 is 3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049. So yes, 3^10 is 59,049, so a_9 = (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 =29,524. Correct.\n\nTherefore, 3*29,524=88,572.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or computations.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2.

So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back through each layer to check for errors. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems right. Hmm, but wait, I'm wondering if there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain sequence. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer manually, just to confirm. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. This resembles a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as n=1. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that. If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. For n=2, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which also matches. For n=3, a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40, correct. So yes, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for the 9th layer, n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. I think this method is more efficient and confirms that the step-by-step computation was correct. It's also good to see that both methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that 88572 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested structure of the expression and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( a_n \\) where \\( n \\) is the layer number starting from the innermost as \\( n=1 \\). The recurrence relation for each layer is:\n\\[ a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\]\nwith the initial condition \\( a_1 = 4 \\).\n\nWe compute each layer step by step:\n- Layer 1: \\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n- Layer 2: \\( a_2 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 4 = 13 \\)\n- Layer 3: \\( a_3 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 13 = 40 \\)\n- Layer 4: \\( a_4 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 40 = 121 \\)\n- Layer 5: \\( a_5 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 121 = 364 \\)\n- Layer 6: \\( a_6 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 364 = 1093 \\)\n- Layer 7: \\( a_7 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 1093 = 3280 \\)\n- Layer 8: \\( a_8 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 3280 = 9841 \\)\n- Layer 9: \\( a_9 = 1 + 3 \\cdot 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[ \\boxed{88572} \\]"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. This seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me write that down:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2\n...\na_9 = 1 + 3*a_8\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can solve this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u21d2 C = 1 + 3C \u21d2 -2C = 1 \u21d2 C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the earlier computed values to see if it works. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of this formula. Since the original expression is 3*a_9, and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is correct. Just to recap, the steps were: 1. Recognize the nested structure and decide to compute from the innermost parentheses outward. 2. Compute each layer step by step, keeping track of the results. 3. After computing up to the ninth layer, multiply by 3 as per the original expression. 4. Alternatively, derive a formula for the nth layer using recurrence relations to avoid computing each step manually, which confirmed the result. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by evaluating 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.

So Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the initial problem again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the numbers are getting large quickly. Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, just to verify.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n = 1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, that's a neat formula. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = 243 -1 = 242/2 = 121, correct.\n\nSo, this formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is a_9, the value would be (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again.\n\n29524 *3:\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\n4 *3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2 *3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 *3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4) *3 = 20000*3 +9000*3 +500*3 +20*3 +4*3 = 60000 +27000 +1500 +60 +12 = 60000 +27000=87000 +1500=88500 +60=88560 +12=88572.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by expanding it from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the result is 88572. Wait, that seems correct. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in each layer. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. If I can find a general formula for a_n, maybe I can compute it without calculating each layer. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, solving this recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Then, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the equation: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. So, a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, matches Layer 1. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct, matches Layer 2. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct, Layer 3. So, this formula seems to work. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, the value is (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. So, this method also gives the same result, which is reassuring. I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the recurrence relation\u2014lead to the same result. Therefore, I think I'm done here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572. Let me confirm with another method. 29524 * 3 can be broken down as (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yep, that checks out. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing each layer. Let me go through each layer again to verify. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I could recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe there's a formula for such a sequence. Let me think about that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using the method for solving linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The homogeneous solution comes from solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer before multiplying by 3, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to confirm the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times\\) the next layer.
