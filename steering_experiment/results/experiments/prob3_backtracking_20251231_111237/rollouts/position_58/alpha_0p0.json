    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, but let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. Let me write 29524 as 2 9 5 2 4.

Let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048; 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me go through each layer again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be faster or more efficient. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated application of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each layer is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve it. Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. To find a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. Substituting into the equation: B = 1 + 3*B => B = 1 + 3B => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n = 1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with the earlier layers. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula for the nth term, I arrive at the same result. This gives me confidence that the answer is correct. Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 to confirm. 3^1 = 3\n3^2 = 9\n3^3 = 27\n3^4 = 81\n3^5 = 243\n3^6 = 729\n3^7 = 2187\n3^8 = 6561\n3^9 = 19683\n3^10 = 59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Hmm, but wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me double-check how many layers there are. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is Layer 1. Then each subsequent 1+3( starts a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, after the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses. Each one represents a layer. So, actually, there are 8 layers, not 9. Wait, so maybe my initial count was wrong. Let me recount. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, 1 + 3 is Layer 1. Then each 1 + 3(...) adds a layer. Let's count how many times 1 + 3(...) appears. The innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more. So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then moving out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). And so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost one before the final 3. Wait, but when I started computing earlier, I went up to Layer 9, which was 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But now I'm confused because I thought there were 8 layers. Let me clarify. Let me write the expression with indices to see how many layers there are. Let me denote the innermost expression as E1: E1 = 1 + 3 Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 E3 = 1 + 3*E2 E4 = 1 + 3*E3 E5 = 1 + 3*E4 E6 = 1 + 3*E5 E7 = 1 + 3*E6 E8 = 1 + 3*E7 E9 = 1 + 3*E8 Then the entire expression is 3*E9. So, yes, there are 9 layers, from E1 to E9, and the final result is 3*E9. So, my initial calculation was correct with 9 layers. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations, let me go through each layer again step by step. Layer 1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Now, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It looks similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that. Suppose we define E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4. Then, each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume E_n^{(p)} = D, where D is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition E_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with n=1: E_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: E_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: E_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049. So, E_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I can compute it without having to calculate each layer step by step. That's a good check. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves evaluating a nested expression with multiple layers.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. But just to be thorough, let me try computing the layers again more carefully. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So, yes, each layer is correct. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. I think that's the right answer. But just to be extra sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented as a geometric series or something similar. Let me see if that's possible here. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). Each time, it's 1 + 3*something. If I denote the entire inner expression as x, then x = 1 + 3x, but that would be the case if the expression were infinitely nested, which it's not here. But in our case, it's finite, with nine layers. So, maybe I can model it as a finite geometric series. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a recursive formula. Let me think. Let's denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. And so on, up to a_9. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that. For n=1: a_1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1. But wait, our a_1 is 4. So that formula doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. Let's test that. For n=1: (3^{2} - 3)/2 = (9 - 3)/2 = 6/2 = 3. No, that's not matching a_1=4. Hmm. Maybe another approach. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let's compute the first few terms to see the pattern: a1 = 4\na2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. Let's try to solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, a_1=4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct, matches a1=4.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct, matches a2=13.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a3=40.\n\nGood, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nThus, a9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier when computing step by step. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me compute 3^10 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524*3: 29524*3, as before, is 88572. So, yes, everything checks out.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Since each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we've found a closed-form expression for a_n, which is (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so for n=9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2, and then multiplied by 3, so the total expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. That's another way to get the same result, confirming that 88572 is correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and cross-checking with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous result)}\\), leading up to the ninth layer, which is 29524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**  \n   \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. **Layer 2:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n\n3. **Layer 3:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n\n4. **Layer 4:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n\n5. **Layer 5:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n\n6. **Layer 6:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n\n7. **Layer 7:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n\n8. **Layer 8:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n\n9. **Layer 9:**  \n   \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

Wait, but let me double-check my earlier steps because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an error. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240, 0*3=0. So, 9000 + 600=9600 +240=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression. Suppose we have n layers. Let me denote the value after k layers as a_k, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. So, a_{k} = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, with a_1 = 4. Then, the expression is 3*a_9. So, the problem reduces to computing a_9 where a_k = 1 + 3*a_{k-1}, a_1 = 4. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_k. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is a_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is solving a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^k. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = A*3^k + (-1/2). Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (3/2)*3^k - 1/2 = (3^{k+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. So, for k=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result, which gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10} directly, which is 59049, and then compute (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Either way, the answer is consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, tens digit is 7. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8, write down 8. So the result is 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me cross-verify this because I feel like I might have made a mistake in the layers. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make an error in the earlier computations. Starting again: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize without computing each layer individually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier computation. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n without computing each term step by step. Let me see if this recurrence relation can be expressed in a closed-form. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the initial condition. For n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B. Let me assume that the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Let me substitute a_n = A*3^n + B into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Let's compute the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Now, set the left-hand side equal to the right-hand side: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = 3A + (-1/2). So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result without computing each layer step by step. It's interesting how recognizing the recurrence relation can simplify the problem. I think this confirms that the answer is indeed 88572. Just to make sure, I'll do a quick calculation using the formula. Since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, adding up the products: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, just compute 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Either way, it adds up to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. It's a bit surprising how each layer grows so quickly, but with each multiplication by 3 and addition of 1, the numbers escalate rapidly. It's a good reminder of how exponential growth works. I think I've covered all the steps and verified my answer multiple times, so I'm pretty sure this is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or recognizing the recurrence relation, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, we multiply the result by 3 to get the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinal result: 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So the result is 88572. Let me check that multiplication again: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So yes, 88572. So the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate one of the inner layers, which would throw off the entire result. So let me go through each layer again. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer step by step. Since each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer), it seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, then the expression is 3*a_9. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's test that. Suppose a_n = A*3^n + B. Then, substituting into the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} => A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) => A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtracting A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Hmm, that's a fraction. Let me check if that's correct. So, a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the answer is 88572. Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I end up with the same answer: 88572. I think that's solid. Just to recap, the problem was a nested expression with nine layers, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or finding a closed-form formula using the recurrence relation, I arrived at the same answer. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By systematically computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recurrence relation. Solving this recurrence, we determine that the innermost layers compute to 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, and 29524 respectively.

Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let me add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 20000 + 20000 = 40000, 9000 + 9000 = 18000, 500 + 500 = 1000, 20 + 20 = 40, 4 + 4 = 8. So 40000 + 18000 = 58000, 58000 + 1000 = 59000, 59000 + 40 = 59040, 59040 + 8 = 59048. Now, add another 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524.

So, I think the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me think again. Is there a pattern here that I could have recognized earlier to save time? Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming, and if there's a formula, that might be faster. Let me see: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, and maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + (b)/(a-1). Let me verify that. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, assuming a constant, is L_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check each step again. Starting from the innermost Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841.

So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's see: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524. Adding 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula, but since the number of layers is manageable (nine layers), computing each step by step is feasible. Alternatively, noticing that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try to find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 = 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the answer.

Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, 88572. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check that again. 29524 * 3: Let's compute it step by step: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, so 7, no carryover. Next digit: 5*3=15, so 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, so 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, so 8. So, the result is 88572. Hmm, but wait, 3*29524: Let me compute it another way to verify. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.

So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, that's not the correct way because 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that matches. So the final answer is 88572. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. Maybe I can check a few layers to see if they are correct. Let's verify Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. So, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This recurrence relation might have a closed-form solution. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Plugging in n=1: L_1 = A*3 + B = 4. And the recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, so substituting into the general solution: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Therefore, equating both sides: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Then, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: L_1 = 3A + B = 4. Since B = -1/2, we have 3A - 1/2 = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. For n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, I could compute the entire expression using the formula. Let me see. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, 3^{11}=177147. Therefore, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572, which matches the previous result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. That gives me confidence that 88572 is the correct result. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Okay, that seems correct. But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in another way. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from 1. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13 a_3=1 +3a_2=1 +39=40 a_4=1 +3a_3=1 +120=121 a_5=1 +3a_4=1 +363=364 a_6=1 +3a_5=1 +1092=1093 a_7=1 +3a_6=1 +3279=3280 a_8=1 +3a_7=1 +9840=9841 a_9=1 +3a_8=1 +29523=29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. Alternatively, maybe I can model this recurrence relation. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is linear and can be expressed as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. Thus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 +1/2 =9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2. Alternatively, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have a_9. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it without computing each layer, I could use this formula. But since the problem only has nine layers, computing each step wasn't too bad. So, I think I've arrived at the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recurrence formula confirms the result. So, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

So, the final answer is 88572. Let me verify if I did each layer correctly. Let me go back and check each layer's computation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions, but since each layer is straightforward, computing each step by step seems manageable. Alternatively, if I recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4, then this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if that approach would give the same result. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute a few terms: a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nWhich matches what I computed earlier. So, the general solution for this recurrence relation can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C \u2192 C - 3*C = 1 \u2192 -2C = 1 \u2192 C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. Wait, hold on, a_1 is when n=1, which is 4. So, plugging n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, let me check what n is here. Wait, in my earlier computation, I labeled the innermost as Layer 1, which is a_1 = 4, and then Layer 2 is a_2 = 13, up to Layer 9 being a_9 = 29524. So, according to the general solution, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. Therefore, the expression inside the outermost 3*(...) is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct, and using the recurrence relation approach also leads to the same result.

Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together, we get 88572. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost layer: Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1+3*4=1+12=13, correct. Layer 3: 1+3*13=1+39=40, correct. Layer 4: 1+3*40=1+120=121, correct. Layer 5: 1+3*121=1+363=364, correct. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1+1092=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=1+3279=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=1+9840=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=1+29523=29524, correct. Then, 3 * 29524: 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. So, adding the carries: 12: write 2, carry 1; 2*3=6+1=7; 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1; 9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2; 2*3=6+2=8. So, the number is 88572. Yep, that seems right. Alternatively, I could have noticed a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that. If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Hmm, so each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. That seems like a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a general formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. Let's see if I can solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, and the particular solution would be a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. Let me assume a particular solution L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: L_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same result as before. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my previous calculation. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. But since I was unsure at first, computing each layer was a good way to verify the pattern and then find a general formula. Either way, whether by iterative computation or by solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same answer. So, I'm confident that the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me see if I can find a general formula for Layer n.\n\nLet\u2019s denote L(n) as the value of Layer n. So,\n\nL(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L(n) = A*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_p. Let's solve it.\n\nThe recurrence is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nApplying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with n=1:\n\nL(1) = (3^(1+1) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:\n\nL(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:\n\nL(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:\n\nL(4)=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:\n\nL(5)=(3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6:\n\nL(6)=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7:\n\nL(7)=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8:\n\nL(8)=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9:\n\nL(9)=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. Let me compute that to see if it matches 88572.\n\nCompute 3^11: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yes, that's the same as before. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough. I didn't skip any steps, and I double-checked using a general formula for the recurrence relation, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29524.

Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's write out the first few terms: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. To find a closed-form solution, we can solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Then, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the final expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Alternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^{11} = 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of 1 plus 3 times another expression.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used to compute this without calculating each layer, but since it's only nine layers, doing it step by step wasn't too bad. Let me check if there's a pattern in the layers. Let's list the layers and their values:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers, each layer seems to be following the pattern: each term is 1 + 3*(previous term).

Correct.\n\nLayer 2: n=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: n=3, a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: n=4, a_4=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: n=5, a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: n=6, a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: n=7, a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: n=8, a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: n=9, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nPerfect! So, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives the value of each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524, which matches our earlier computation.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the answer. I think I've double-checked each step, both by computing each layer manually and by deriving a formula for the nth layer, which gave the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 &= 1 + 39 = 40, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 &= 1 + 120 = 121, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 &= 1 + 363 = 364, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 &= 1 + 1092 = 1093, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 &= 1 + 3279 = 3280, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 &= 1 + 9840 = 9841, \\\\\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 &= 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n4. The outermost layer is then multiplied by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nTo verify, we use the closed-form formula for the recurrence relation \\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\\), which gives \\(a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\\). For \\(n = 9\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   a_9 = \\frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \\frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\n   \\]\nMultiplying by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7, write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have messed up the carry-over somewhere. Let me write it down step by step:\n\n29524\n\u00d7      3\n--------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6. Add the carry-over 1: 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 \u00d7 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Add the carry-over 1: 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 \u00d7 3 = 6. Add the carry-over 2: 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo the result is 88572. Let me verify that multiplication to be sure. 29524 \u00d7 3: 20000 \u00d7 3 = 60000, 9000 \u00d7 3 = 27000, 500 \u00d7 3 = 1500, 20 \u00d7 3 = 60, 4 \u00d7 3 = 12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer is computed by taking 1 + 3 times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost layer, which is 4, each subsequent layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. After computing up to the ninth layer, which gives 29524, we then multiply that by 3 to get the final result of 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure that I didn't skip any or make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if the number of layers is correct. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times...))). So, each time, we have a 1 + 3(...), so starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is indeed nine, so Layer 9 is the outermost one before the final multiplication by 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer follows the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_1 would be 1 + 3 = 4, as we computed. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet's see: The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, write the homogeneous solution: The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K, where K is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2.\n\nSolve for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. Perfect, so the formula works.\n\nTherefore, a_9 =29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, because a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2, so 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula. But since the problem didn't specify using a formula, I think computing each layer step by step is also acceptable, especially since it's only nine layers.\n\nLet me just recap what I did: I broke down the expression into layers, starting from the innermost parentheses, computed each layer by substituting the previous result, and then multiplied the outermost result by 3 to get the final answer. I also verified each step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, and I even derived a general formula for the nth layer, which helped confirm that my step-by-step computation was correct.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By breaking it down from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed by substituting the previous result. The final step involves multiplying the outermost result by 3. Using a step-by-step approach and verifying each computation ensures accuracy.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is of the form 1 + 3*(previous term). There are nine such layers before the final multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost result by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yep, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Maybe I should verify each layer step by step again. Starting over, computing each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula I can use to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). That looks like a geometric series. Let's see if I can model this. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. I can try to find a closed-form formula for L_n. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. Hmm, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. For n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is L_9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if I applied the formula correctly. Since the layers go from 1 to 9, and each layer corresponds to n=1 to n=9, then L_9 is indeed (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression as 3*(L_9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether computing each layer step by step or using the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer9). So yes, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can see if there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be time-consuming and prone to error. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on. So this is a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2, so A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4, which matches a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which matches a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40, which is correct. So the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572, which is the same as before. So, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the general formula from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same result. So yeah, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer equals 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested structure with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, writing it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's compute 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524: 4 + 4 = 8, 2 + 2 = 4, 5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1. 9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1. 2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5. So, 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Now add another 29524: 59048 + 29524: 8 + 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. 0 + 5 = 5, write down 5. 9 + 9 = 18, write down 8, carry over 1. 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8, write down 8. So, the result is 88572. Therefore, 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, the final answer should be 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers because maybe I made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make an error. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. This is a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Wait, actually, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then each time we go out, it's another layer. So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: Each \"1 + 3(\" is a new layer. Let me see: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each time wrapping another 1+3(...). How many layers? Let's see:\n\nThe innermost is 1+3, which is layer 1.\n\nThen each step out adds a layer, so:\n\nLayer 1: 1+3\n\nLayer 2: 1+3(Layer1)\n\nLayer3:1+3(Layer2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer9:1+3(Layer8)\n\nSo, there are 9 layers in total. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier for Layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this confirms that the final answer is 88572. Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Wait, let me check that: 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, either way, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get 88572 as the final answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by recognizing a pattern and using a recurrence relation. Each layer follows the form \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\), starting from \\( a_1 = 4 \\). The solution involves computing each layer step by step or using a closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. The final result is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly because I might have made a mistake in the number of layers. Let me recount the original expression. The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's see: Starting with 3(...). Then inside that, 1 + 3(...). So each time, it's 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times the pattern 1 + 3(...) appears. Let's see:\n\n1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. From the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each time wrapping around. So, starting from the innermost, each step adds a layer. Let me count the number of layers by counting the number of times '1 + 3(' appears. Let's see:\n\n- The innermost is 1 + 3\n- Then, moving out, each step is 1 + 3(...\n\nSo, each time we go out a layer, we add another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of '1 + 3(' instances.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3(, there are 8 more '1 + 3(' instances because each opening parenthesis after the first one adds a new layer. Wait, no, perhaps it's 9 layers because each '1 + 3(' adds a new layer, and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, maybe I have 9 layers in total. Let me check:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nUp to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8)\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, in my earlier calculation, I computed up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each '1 + 3(' introduces a new layer. So, in the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach '1 + 3(' adds a new layer.

Each time, it's 1+3 followed by another parenthesis.\n\nSo, starting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1+3\n2. 1+3(1+3)\n3. 1+3(1+3(1+3))\n...\nContinuing until the outermost layer.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of layers is 9 because each '1+3(' is a new layer, starting from the innermost. Let me try to count the number of '1+3(' after the initial 3(.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nI can see that after the initial 3(, there are 8 more '1+3('s because each time a new layer starts. So, that would make 9 layers in total, including the innermost one.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I went up to Layer 9 as 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But perhaps I made an error in the computation of each layer. Let me go through each layer again step by step to check for any mistakes.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nSo, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as:\n\n29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. That also checks out.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. Let me count the number of times '1 + 3(' appears in the original expression.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, no, that seems like 9 layers, each time adding another '1 + 3('.\n\nSo, each layer is one more '1 + 3(' than the previous. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9.\n\nThus, my computation up to layer 9 is correct, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in the computations. Each step follows logically, and the multiplications and additions are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something similar. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, recursively, each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, where r is the coefficient and c is the constant. In this case, r = 3 and c = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is given by a_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^{n} - 1) + (a_1 - c/(r - 1))*r^{n-1}\n\nWait, actually, the standard solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c is:\n\na_n = (c/(r - 1))*(r^{n} - 1) + (a_1 - c/(r - 1))*r^{n-1}\n\nBut let me check that. Alternatively, the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*r^n, where A is a constant.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^{(p)} = B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nB = r*B + c => B - r*B = c => B*(1 - r) = c => B = c/(1 - r)\n\nWait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, so using the method, the particular solution would be B = c/(1 - r). But in our case, r = 3, so B = 1/(1 - 3) = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2)\n\nApplying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9.\n\nThus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. This gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is indeed 9. In the original expression, how many times does the pattern 1 + 3( occur? Let me count them:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. 1 + 3\n2. 1 + 3(1 + 3)\n3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\n4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\n5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\n7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))\n9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))\n\nWait, that seems like 9 layers. Each time, we add another '1 + 3('. So, yes, n=9, so a_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe given expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's see: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048; 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. Let me go back and check each layer step by step to ensure I didn't make an error earlier. Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 +9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then 3*29524=88572. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It seems similar to a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me consider the general form. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. We can solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. Let's plug in the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Substituting the general solution: A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1. Simplify the right side: 3*(A*3^{n-1}) = A*3^n, and 3*B = 3B. So, right side becomes A*3^n + 3B + 1. Therefore, equation: A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 3B + 1. Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. When n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. We know B = -1/2, so 3A - 1/2 = 4. Then, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we determine that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, we find the value is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, putting it all together, the final result is 88572. But let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by recognizing a pattern or using a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model this. Let's denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, the recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. So, we have a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form B, where B is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the values I computed earlier. For n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the value of Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the formula, I arrive at the same result, which confirms that my step-by-step computation was correct. Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a sum in a geometric series. Let me see. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's similar to expanding a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. If I expand the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). So, expanding this, it's 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3*3^8, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it because each term is not just multiplied by 3, but each term is 1 + 3*(...). Wait, perhaps it's better to model the entire expression as a sum. Let me try that approach. Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Let me count the number of 3s. Each time we have a 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers. So, the expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers. Wait, but earlier I computed E as 3*a_9, where a_9 is the 9th layer. So, E = 3*a_9 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can express E as a sum. Let me try to expand E step by step. E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me try to expand this without substituting each layer. Let me denote each inner expression as follows:\n\nLet me define E_k as the expression starting from the k-th layer. So, E_1 = 1 + 3\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*E_1\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*E_2\n\n...\n\nE_9 = 1 + 3*E_8\n\nAnd the total expression is E = 3*E_9\n\nSo, as before, E_1 = 4\n\nE_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nE_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\n...\n\nUp to E_9 = 29524\n\nThen, E = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write E in terms of a geometric series. Let's see:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this step by step, but in reverse. Let me start from the innermost and work my way out.\n\nLet me define each step as follows:\n\nStep 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nStep 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nStep 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nStep 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nStep 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nStep 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nStep 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nStep 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nStep 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572\n\nThis is the same as before. So, regardless of the method, I keep getting 88572 as the final result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a sum where each term is multiplied by 3^k. Let me see:\n\nEach time we have a 1, and then 3 times another term. So, expanding E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )))\n\nLet me try to expand it:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand the innermost part first:\n\nStarting from the innermost 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, moving out, 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nThen, 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write E as:\n\nE = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3*3^8 + 3*3^9\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct because each term is not just 3^k, but each term is 1 + 3*(...), so it's more complex than a simple geometric series.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as E = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9 + 3*(1). Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of each layer as adding a term. Let me try:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))))) \n\nLet me count the number of 1s and 3s in the expansion.\n\nEach layer adds a 1 and a 3 times the next layer. So, perhaps E can be expressed as a sum of 3^k terms.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf I expand E, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))))\n\nLet me try to expand it step by step:\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand the innermost part first:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nNext: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nNext: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nNext: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nNext: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nNext: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nNext: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nNext: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, E = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, regardless of how I approach it, the result is the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a geometric series. The general formula for a geometric series is S = a*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nBut in this case, the expression isn't a simple geometric series because each term is 1 + 3*something. However, from the earlier analysis, we saw that each layer a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, E = 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the formula, we can compute it directly without expanding each layer. That's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can recognize that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence, and we've already solved it as a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and E = 3*a_9 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've approached this problem in multiple ways: step-by-step expansion, recognizing the recurrence relation, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence, and considering the expression as a geometric series. All methods lead to the same result, which gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me verify the computation of 3^10. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute that again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, right? So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after verifying all steps and computations, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a deeply nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0. Next: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that would be 88572? Wait, let me check that again because I think I might have misaligned the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n      2 9 5 2 4\n    x        3\n    ------------\n      8 8 5 7 2\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, so write 2, carryover 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing from the last multiplication to the first, it's 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88,572. Wait, but let me confirm with another method. Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: 29,524 + 29,524 + 29,524. Let me add them up:\n\n29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048.\n\n59,048 + 29,524 = Let's add 59,048 + 29,524.\n\nAdding units: 8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nTens: 4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nHundreds: 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nThousands: 9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carryover 1.\n\nTen-thousands: 5 + 2 = 7 + 1 (carryover) = 8.\n\nSo, 88,572. Okay, that matches. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier layers again because sometimes when you do multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572. So, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) eight times. So, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...) terms. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost: 1+3.\n\nThen each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count how many times 3*(1 + ...) occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers, as I thought before. So, my computation of 9 layers is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or using a recursive formula. Let me think about that.\n\nLet me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1.\n\nSimilarly, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2, and so on up to L_9.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A \u21d2 -2A = 1 \u21d2 A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, when n=1, L_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the earlier layers to make sure.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_9 = 29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that's the same result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good consistency check.\n\nAlternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nSo, 3^{10} is 59,049. Therefore, (59,049 -1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, so I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, putting it all together: 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me write it down properly:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of the innermost Layer 1 is 4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to Layer 9, which is 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me verify if I correctly counted the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many layers there are. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1+3\n\nThen, each time, it's 1+3( ... ). So, the innermost is 1+3, which is Layer 1.\n\nThen, moving out, it's 1+3*(Layer 1) = Layer 2.\n\nThen, 1+3*(Layer 2) = Layer 3.\n\nContinuing this, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.\n\nThe expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nEach opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nWait, so there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. So, that would mean there are 9 layers, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so Layer 2, Layer 3, up to Layer 9. So, I think I correctly computed up to Layer 9, which was 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes when you do multiple steps, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check Layer 8 again: 3*3,280. 3,280 * 3: 3,000*3=9,000; 280*3=840; so total is 9,840. Then, 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 3*9,841. Let's compute 9,841 * 3: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct.\n\nThen, 29,524 * 3: Let's do it again. 29,524 * 3:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88,572. Correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression using another approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost as L1.\n\nSo, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for L_n.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, which has a solution of the form L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + c, where c is a constant. Wait, actually, more accurately, for the recurrence L_n = a + b*L_{n-1}, the solution is L_n = a*(b^{n} - 1)/(b - 1) + L_0, assuming L_0 is known.\n\nWait, in our case, L1 = 4, L2 = 13, etc. So, if we model this as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L1 = 4.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to index starting from n=0. Let me adjust.\n\nLet me define L0 = 1, then L1 = 1 + 3*L0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4.\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nSo, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L0 = 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found using standard methods.\n\nThe homogeneous solution comes from L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1.\n\nWait, actually, the equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1.\n\nThe homogeneous part is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, a constant.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition. When n=0, L0 = 1.\n\nSo, 1 = C*3^0 + (-1/2) => 1 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=0: L0 = (3^{1} -1)/2 = (3-1)/2 = 1, correct.\n\nn=1: L1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct.\n\nn=2: L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, correct.\n\nn=3: L3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works.\n\nNow, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from L1 up to L9.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the problem, the innermost is L1, then each layer adds one. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is computed as per the formula.\n\nWait, so let's compute L9 using the formula:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nBecause n=9: L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I computed earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula, which is much faster, especially for larger n.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check the number of layers again. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them:\n\nStarting after the first 3, the first ( is Layer 1, then each subsequent ( adds another layer. Let me count the number of ( after the initial 3:\n\n1. (1+3(\n2. (1+3(\n3. (1+3(\n4. (1+3(\n5. (1+3(\n6. (1+3(\n7. (1+3(\n8. (1+3(\n9. (1+3(\n\nSo, 9 layers, which means n=9 in our formula, giving L9=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to code this, I could write a simple loop to compute each layer step by step, but since it's only 9 layers, doing it manually is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, it's straightforward.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after carefully computing each layer and verifying with a closed-form formula, the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Innermost layer (Layer 1):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Let me recheck each layer computation step by step to ensure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or pattern I can use to compute this without having to calculate each layer manually, which could be time-consuming and prone to error, especially with so many layers. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to follow a pattern where each term is 1 plus three times the previous term. So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1, then: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Wait, that seems odd because all our a_n are positive integers, so maybe this approach isn't directly applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the recurrence relation as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Let's try to find a pattern or formula for a_n. Let me compute a few more terms to see if a pattern emerges. a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 Hmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, which is consistent with the recurrence. Alternatively, maybe I can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. Let me try expanding the recurrence a few times. a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 1 + 3*1 + 3^2*a_{n-2} = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2}. Continuing this, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. Wait, but our a_1 is 4, so maybe a_0 would be something else. Wait, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. But a_1 is 4, so 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. So, then, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0. But a_0 is 1, so a_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 3^k + 3^n*1. The sum from k=0 to n-1 of 3^k is (3^n - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^n - 1)/2 + 3^n = (3^n - 1 + 2*3^n)/2 = (3^n + 2*3^n -1)/2 = (3*3^n -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me check if this formula works with the values I have. For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct, a_1=4. For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct, a_2=13. For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct, a_3=40. So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so 59049 -1 = 59048. Then, 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the value I computed earlier for a_9. So, that's a good consistency check. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute that: 3^11 is 177147, so 177147 -3 = 177144. Then, 177144 /2 = 88572. That's the same result as before. So, this seems to confirm that the final answer is indeed 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me go through each layer again with the formula. For example, for n=4: a_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches. Similarly, n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, using this formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is building up a geometric progression. But regardless, the step-by-step computation and the formula both lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute the expression:\n\n$3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(next layer)}\\).

So yes, 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct, but maybe I can check it another way. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a recursive expression. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but maybe I can compute it step by step as I did before. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series. Let me try to expand a few terms to see if a pattern emerges. a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3*1\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9 + 27) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121\nWait a minute, this looks familiar. 1, 3, 9, 27, 81... These are powers of 3. So, each a_n seems to be 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^{n}.\n\nWait, but let me check that. For a_1, it's 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1. For a_2, it's 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2. For a_3, it's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40, which is 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3. So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. But wait, that's a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous one, starting from 1. The sum of the first k terms of a geometric series with ratio r is S = (r^k - 1)/(r - 1). So, in this case, r = 3, so the sum up to 3^{k} is (3^{k+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our case, a_n is the sum up to 3^{n}, so for a_1, it's 1 + 3^1 = 4, which would be (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For a_2, 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which would be (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. So, indeed, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count. The expression is 3*(...), and inside, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's exactly what I got earlier for Layer 9. So, that's correct. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent with both methods. Alternatively, since a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. For n=9, that would be (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute 3^{11}. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049, 3^11=177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's the same result as before. So, that's another way to compute it without expanding each layer, by recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we can use the formula for the sum of the series to find the solution efficiently.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: Each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.\n\n2. **Recognize the Geometric Series**: The layers form a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous one.

Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, that seems high, but let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me recompute each layer quickly: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Then, 3*29524 = 88572. That seems consistent. Hmm, but wait, I just realized that the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3 times Layer 9, which is 29524. So, yes, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without expanding each layer. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous. Let's denote L_n as the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's see, the recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. We have L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^{(p)} = C. Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049, so (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what we got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the linear recurrence. That's pretty cool. It saves a lot of time if I can recognize the pattern and apply the formula. But since I'm just starting out, breaking it down step by step was a good approach to understand what's happening. So, to recap, each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. By computing each layer up to L_9, I get 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives the final answer of 88572. Alternatively, using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, I can directly compute L_9 as (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Either way, the answer is the same, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this. After computing all nine layers, we find the outermost layer is 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence of 1 + 3*(...), with each layer wrapping the previous one. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer starting from the innermost**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The computed value is \\boxed{88572}."

Let's add them up: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, then +9524 = 88572. Yes, so 29524 * 3 = 88572. So, the final answer is 88572. But wait, let me double-check all my steps because this seems like a lot of computation, and it's easy to make an error in one of the layers. Let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L2 = 1 + 3*L1. L3 = 1 + 3*L2. And so on, up to L9. So, each L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L(n). Let's see. The recurrence is L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. Using the recurrence: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Plugging into the general solution: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B). Simplify the right side: 1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. So, we have A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is L(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer using a different method. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series. Let's see. Each term is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. But in this case, it's a finite series with 9 layers. So, the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Let me try to express this as a sum. If I expand the expression, each layer adds another 3^n term. Let me see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, but if I think about it, each Layer n is 1 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, if I expand Layer 9, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). Expanding this, it's 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so it's more like a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, perhaps the expansion is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^8, but let me verify.\n\nWait, when I expand Layer 9, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*(1 + 3)))). Let me count how many 3s are being multiplied. Each time, it's 3^k where k increases by 1 each layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 1 + 3^1.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 3 + 3*3 = 1 + 3 + 9.\n\nWait, that's 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nWait, but 3*13 is 39, which is 3*1 + 3*3 + 3*9 = 3 + 9 + 27.\n\nWait, so when I expand Layer 3, it's 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 4 would be 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 = 121.\n\nWait, so in general, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to k=(n) of 3^k, but wait, that can't be because Layer 1 is 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4, which is sum from k=0 to 1 of 3^k: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is sum from k=0 to 2 of 3^k: 1 + 3 + 9 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: sum from k=0 to 3 of 3^k: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40.\n\nSo, in general, Layer n is the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k. But wait, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 would be the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k. Wait, but earlier, when I computed using the recurrence, Layer 9 was 29524, which is (3^10 - 1)/2. Let me check what the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k is.\n\nThe sum of a geometric series is S = (r^(n+1) - 1)/(r - 1). Here, r=3, n=9, so S = (3^10 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Yes, that matches. So, Layer 9 is indeed the sum from k=0 to 9 of 3^k, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the answer. Alternatively, I could have recognized this pattern earlier and saved myself some computation. But since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrive at the same result, I'm confident that the answer is correct. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093.\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280.\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841.\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524.\n10. Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nEach step seems correct. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can compute Layer 9 as (3^10 - 1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost value is 4, and each subsequent layer builds upon this. After computing all layers up to the ninth, we find the value to be 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):**\n   - Compute 1 + 3 = 4.\n\n2. **Layer 2:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\n3. **Layer 3:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\n4. **Layer 4:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121.\n\n5. **Layer 5:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364.\n\n6. **Layer 6:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093.\n\n7. **Layer 7:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280.\n\n8. **Layer 8:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841.\n\n9. **Layer 9:**\n   - Compute 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524.\n\n10. **Final Step:**\n    - Multiply Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29,524 = 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a geometric series or something similar, but since each layer is only two terms, maybe it's just easier to compute each layer step by step. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used here. Let me think: Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. The recursive formula is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve for A and B. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. Just to be thorough, maybe I can compute one more layer manually to ensure my formula is correct. Let's take Layer 4: According to the formula, L_4 = (3^{5} -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Which matches my earlier calculation. So, the formula is working. Therefore, confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Write down 7.\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Let me verify this multiplication with another method to be sure. 29524 * 3: 30000 * 3 = 90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that checks out. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I computed each layer correctly. Let me go through each layer again to see if I made any mistakes. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the expression in a different way. Let me consider the structure of the expression. It's a series of nested terms where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a geometric series or something. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such nested expressions. Let me think. Suppose we have an expression like a + b(a + b(a + b(...))). If we have n layers, then each layer can be expressed recursively. Let me try to find a pattern or a formula for the nth layer. Let's denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. Then, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. Hmm, I see that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve this recurrence relation. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^p = K, where K is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1 => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. For n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9 (since there are 9 layers in the original expression), L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524=88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's solid. But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer again using the formula to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Using L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, let's compute each layer: n=1: (3^2 -1)/2= (9-1)/2=4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. So, all layers computed via the formula match the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572. I think that's the correct answer. Just to ensure there's no mistake in the multiplication, let me compute 29524 *3 again: 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is essentially a geometric series. Since each term is multiplied by 3, the sum of such a series would be (3^{n} -1)/2, which is exactly what we found. So, the formula aligns with the structure of the problem.\n\nTherefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying with a formula, and double-checking the multiplication, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested series where each term is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous term)}\\).

So, reading from top, it's 88572. Wait, let me check: 29524 *3: 29524*3=88572. Let me verify with another method: 29524*3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add them: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me go back and check if I did all the layers correctly because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake in computing one of the layers. Let me recount each layer step by step to ensure accuracy. Starting again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nWait, that seems correct each time. Each layer is computed by taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on. So, each step seems accurate. Therefore, the final answer should indeed be 88572. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine layers. This looks similar to a geometric series, but it's nested, so it's more like a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. So, the sequence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can write it in homogeneous form. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as before. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms the answer again. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute each layer again using the formula to see if I get the same numbers.\n\nUsing a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLayer 1 (n=1): (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2 (n=2): (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3 (n=3): (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4 (n=4): (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5 (n=5): (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6 (n=6): (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7 (n=7): (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8 (n=8): (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9 (n=9): (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers match using the formula, which adds more confidence. Therefore, the final answer is indeed 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost expression is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the ninth layer, which gives the final answer.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
