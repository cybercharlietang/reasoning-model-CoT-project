    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. So, putting it all together, we have 8 8 5 7 2. Wait, that can't be right because 29524 * 3 is 88572. Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then +29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me recount each layer: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. This kind of expression resembles a geometric series, perhaps. Let me see. If I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. So, L_1 = 4 L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 And so on. This recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me solve the recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = D, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: D = 1 + 3*D => D - 3D = 1 => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the formula, I arrive at the same answer. Therefore, I'm confident that the correct result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested structure where each layer is defined by the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4. Using the formula for the nth term of this recurrence, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, we find L_9 = 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12. So, write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, no carryover. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 30000 * 3 = 90000, but 29524 is 30000 - 476. So, 90000 - (476 * 3) = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go back and check each layer computation step by step. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. So Layer 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. So Layer 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Layer 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then multiply by 3: 29524 *3 = 88572. So yes, that seems correct. I think I did each step correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see if I can find a formula for this instead of computing each layer step by step. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me consider a general case where we have n layers. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Alternatively, since each layer is L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, and the outermost expression is 3*L_9, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let me compute that: 3^11 is 177147. So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result. So, that's another way to approach it, recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. That might have saved some time instead of computing each layer, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable either way. I think I've double-checked it enough, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can compute each nested layer step by step.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just go back through my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: 1+3=4. Then each layer: 1+3*previous. Layer 2: 1+12=13. Layer3:1+39=40. Layer4:1+120=121. Layer5:1+363=364. Layer6:1+1092=1093. Layer7:1+3279=3280. Layer8:1+9840=9841. Layer9:1+29523=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression, which might save time or confirm the result. I remember that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ... )) can sometimes be expressed using geometric series or recursive formulas. Let me think about this. Let's denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a recursive relation where each term depends on the previous one. To solve this recurrence relation, we can find a closed-form expression. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=1. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = C*a^n + d, where C is a constant determined by initial conditions, and d is the particular solution. Let's find d first. Setting L_n = d, then d = 3*d + 1. Solving for d: d - 3d = 1 => -2d = 1 => d = -1/2. So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: L_1 = 4. So, when n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. n=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L_9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. That matches what I got earlier.

So, I think that's the right answer. But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer manually. Because computing each layer step by step is time-consuming, and it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. Let me think about this. Each layer is of the form: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, starting from layer 1 to layer 9. So, layer 9 corresponds to n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute that. 3^11 is 177147, so (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By recognizing the pattern and using the recurrence relation, we can compute the value step by step.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))), with nine layers of nesting.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Each layer follows the relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **General Solution**: Solving the recurrence gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute for Layer 9**: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me recount each layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each step, multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, but wait a minute, let me check the original expression again. The original problem is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...), and there are nine such layers. Then, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, the process I followed was correct: compute each nested expression from the inside out, then multiply the outermost result by 3. So, I think my answer is correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method works. Let's say I have a smaller version with just two layers: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)).\n\nCompute this step by step:\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nThen, multiply by 3: 3*13 = 39.\n\nAlternatively, compute directly: 3(1 + 3(4)) = 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))).\n\nInnermost: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\nNext layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nMultiply by 3: 3*40 = 120.\n\nCompute directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(13)) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller cases, which gives me more confidence that it's correct for the larger problem. Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each layer is computed as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, that seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm a bit confused because when I computed Layer 9, I got 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. But I just want to make sure that I didn't miss a layer or miscount the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. The expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, each time I have \"1+3(...)\", so how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of \"1+3(\" occurrences:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. The innermost is 1+3(1+3(...)), but actually, let me parse the expression correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me try to parse the expression again.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's count the number of layers:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n\n...\n\nEach time, we have a new layer until we reach the outermost. How many layers are there?\n\nLooking at the expression, each time after \"1 + 3(\", there's another set of parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, how many times does this happen?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, after the first \"3(\", there are 8 more \"1 + 3(\" expressions. Wait, no, actually, each time it's 1 + 3(...), so let's see:\n\n- The first layer after 3 is 1 + 3(...), which is Layer 1: 1 + 3\n- Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n- And so on, until Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nWait, but when I count the number of \"1 + 3(\" in the expression, I see that after the initial 3, there are 8 more \"1 + 3(\" terms. Wait, that can't be right because each time you have a \"1 + 3(\", it's one more layer. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, as I initially thought, because each \"1 + 3(\" adds a new layer, and the innermost is 1 + 3 without any further nesting. Let me confirm by writing them out:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1)\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2)\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3)\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4)\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5)\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6)\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7)\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8)\n\nYes, that's 9 layers. So, each time, we have a new layer, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my initial calculation was correct, and the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer again step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't see any errors in these calculations. So, I think the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be represented using a geometric series or a recursive formula. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nThis is a recursive relation. So, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve for A and B.\n\nWe have L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}\n\nAssume L_n = A*3^{n} + B\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, equating both sides:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1\n\nSo, B = -1/2\n\nNow, using the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nL_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier calculations.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: L_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nThis confirms that my earlier step-by-step calculation was correct.\n\nAnother way to think about this is that each layer is a term in a geometric progression. Since each layer is multiplied by 3, the total expression can be seen as a sum of a geometric series. But in this case, since it's a nested structure, the recursive approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a sum of 3 raised to various powers, but I think the recursive method is clearer here.\n\nJust to make sure, let me try computing a few layers manually using the formula:\n\nFor example, Layer 5: n=5, L_5=(3^{6}-1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, Layer 7: n=7, L_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds up, which gives me confidence in the result.\n\nTherefore, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe denote each layer as \\( L_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the layer number. The innermost layer is \\( L_1 \\), and we compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous layer's result.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

If it were more layers, maybe I'd look for a formula, but here, step-by-step computation works fine.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any layers:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1+3=4\n2. Layer 2: 1+3*4=13\n3. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40\n4. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121\n5. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364\n6. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1,093\n7. Layer 7: 1+3*1,093=3,280\n8. Layer 8: 1+3*3,280=9,841\n9.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers were larger. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. The recurrence relation is: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nThus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is solved by evaluating the nested expression from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed by substituting the result of the inner layer into the outer one. The final result after computing all layers and multiplying by 3 is:\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula that can compute this without manually calculating each layer, in case I made a mistake in the layers. Let me think about the structure of the expression. It's a repeated pattern of 1 + 3*(...), which is similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. So, the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n, which would allow me to compute a_9 directly without computing each layer. Let's try that. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3*A - 1/2 = 4. Solving for A: 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the initial terms. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think this confirms that my initial step-by-step computation was correct, and using the recurrence relation gives the same result, which makes me confident that 88572 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a nested expression with repeated patterns. By breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward and using a recurrence relation, we find the solution.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(...), with each layer wrapping the previous one. There are nine such layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**: Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward, compute each layer using the formula a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **Recurrence Relation**: Recognize the pattern as a linear recurrence relation. Solve it to find a closed-form formula, which is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Apply the Formula**: For the ninth layer (n=9), compute a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Final Multiplication**: Multiply the result by 3 as per the original expression: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Next: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me confirm: 29524 * 3. Let's compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, 59048 + 29524: 59048 + 20000 = 79048, 79048 + 9000 = 88048, 88048 + 524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't miscalculate.

Correct. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern here that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, it's similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let's define each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9. Then, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's try to find a pattern. Let me compute the first few terms again to see if I can spot a pattern: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\na_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\na_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\na_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\na_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\na_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\na_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\na_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\na_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nHmm, looking at these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524.\n\nI notice that each term is roughly 3 times the previous term plus 1. So, it's a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for a_9, which is the outermost layer, n=9:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147.\n\nThus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.

As before, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. The expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)), with nine layers. This resembles a geometric series but nested. Let me see if I can find a recursive formula or a closed-form expression for this. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, this is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. Wait, actually, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is the same as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. So, when n=1: a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have nine layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. So, 3^{11} = 177147. Then, 3^{11} - 3 = 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, divide by 2: 177144 / 2 = 88572. So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. This confirms that computing each layer step by step gives the same result as using the closed-form formula. It's reassuring that both methods lead to the same answer. So, I can be confident that the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing the nested expression by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my earlier computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Sometimes when you compute multiple layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic error. Let me go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. Each layer was computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the pattern is consistent, and each step builds upon the previous one correctly.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me see if that approach would work.\n\nLet me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, a_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThen, the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nSo, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nThen, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K.\n\nSolving for K: K - 3K = 1 \u2192 -2K = 1 \u2192 K = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nNow, we need a_9.\n\nSo, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series, but given the structure, the recurrence approach seems more straightforward.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer, which is similar to building a number in base 3, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nIn any case, whether I compute each layer step by step or solve the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result. So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe define each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. So the result is 88572. Let me check that multiplication again to be sure. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, 2*3=6, 5*3=15, 9*3=27, 2*3=6. Adding the carryovers: 12: write 2, carryover 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to double-check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Let me see if that approach works. The expression is a repeated multiplication by 3, so maybe each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give me the same result. Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. Let's see, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. Let me solve for A and B. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, a_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step computation and the formula approach give me the same result. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Wait, but let me verify my calculations because sometimes when I do arithmetic in my head, I might make a mistake. Let me check Layer 9 again: Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9841 * 3. Let me compute that: 9000 * 3 = 27000, 800 * 3 = 2400, 40 * 3 = 120, 1 * 3 = 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, adding 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So that's correct. Then, 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3. 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, 4 * 3 = 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake in my initial multiplication. Let me do it step by step again: 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87572. But when I broke it down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4, I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. I must have messed up the breakdown. Let me compute 29524 * 3 properly. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 87572. So, why did the other method give me 88572? Let me check that again. I think I added the parts incorrectly. Let me break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n500 * 3 = 1500\n20 * 3 = 60\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nWait, that's 88572, but the digit-by-digit multiplication gave me 87572. There's a problem here. I must have broken down the number incorrectly. Let me check 29524. The digits are 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4 = 29524. So, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524. So that's correct. But when I multiplied each part by 3, I got 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 = 88572, but the digit-by-digit multiplication gave me 87572. There's a 1000 difference. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check that again.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Write down 7.\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1.\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2.\n- Ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. Write down 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. So, why is the other method giving me 88572? Let me check the addition again in the other method.\n\n60000 (from 20000 *3)\n+27000 (from 9000*3) = 87000\n+1500 (from 500*3) = 88500\n+60 (from 20*3) = 88560\n+12 (from 4*3) = 88572.\n\nWait a second, so the digit-by-digit method gave me 87572, but the component method gave me 88572. There's a 1000 difference. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method, perhaps the standard algorithm:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nMultiply each digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 87572. So that's correct. Then why does the component method give me 88572? Wait, I think I added the components wrong. Let me add them again:\n\n60000 (from 20000*3)\n+27000 (from 9000*3) = 87000\n+1500 (from 500*3) = 88500\n+60 (from 20*3) = 88560\n+12 (from 4*3) = 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, when I multiply each by 3, I should get 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12, which sums to 88572. But digit-by-digit multiplication gives me 87572. There's a contradiction here. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another approach: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's different again. So, which one is correct? Let me use a calculator approach: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But using the other method, I get 88572. Now I'm confused. There must be a mistake in my component method. Wait, let me compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3.\n\n29000 * 3 = 87000\n524 * 3: 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12 \u2192 1500+60+12=1572\nSo, 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's 88572. But the digit-by-digit multiplication gave me 87572. Now I'm really confused. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check that again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 87572.\n\nBut using the component method, I get 88572. Now I'm really stuck. There's a clear discrepancy. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method: 29524 * 3 = (29500 + 24) * 3 = 29500*3 + 24*3.\n\n29500 * 3: 295 * 3 = 885, so 29500*3 = 88500\n24 * 3 = 72\nSo, 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, so that's 88572. But the digit-by-digit method gave me 87572. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check it again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7        3\n   ------------\n     8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, that would be correct if each digit is multiplied correctly. But according to the component method, it's 88572. I think I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me compute each digit again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- Units place: 4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n- Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n- Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n- Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n- Ten thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But using the component method, I get 88572. There's a problem here. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods. Let me check the component method again. 29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nBut digit-by-digit multiplication gives me 87572. There's a clear inconsistency here. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me write 29524 as:\n\nDigits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units).\n\nSo, when I multiply 29524 by 3, it's:\n\n- Units: 4*3=12 \u2192 2, carry 1\n- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7 \u2192 7\n- Hundreds: 5*3=15 \u21925, carry 1\n- Thousands: 9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carry 2\n- Ten thousands: 2*3=6 +2=8 \u21928\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But according to the component method, it's 88572. I'm clearly making a mistake somewhere. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another approach: 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572.\n\nWait, that's 88572. So, the component method and the algebraic approach both give me 88572, while the digit-by-digit multiplication gives me 87572. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me check it again:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But according to other methods, it's 88572. I must have misaligned the digits or made an error in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me try multiplying 29524 by 3 using the standard algorithm again, step by step.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7        3\n   ------------\n     ? ? ? ? ?\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8\n\nSo, writing it down: 8 7 5 7 2, which is 87572. But according to the component method, it's 88572. There's a contradiction. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Wait, perhaps I miscounted the digits. Let me count the digits in 29524: it's a 5-digit number. So, when I multiply by 3, the result should be a 5-digit number. 87572 is a 5-digit number, as is 88572. So, both are possible, but which one is correct? Let me compute 29524 * 3 using a different approach: 29524 * 3 = (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3.\n\n29000 * 3 = 87000\n524 * 3 = 1572\nSo, 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 88572. I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me try again, carefully:\n\n     2 9 5 2 4\n   \u00d7        3\n   ------------\n     8 7 5 7 2\n\nWait, that would be correct if each digit is correctly multiplied. But according to the component method, it's 88572. I think I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using a calculator to confirm. 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method earlier. Probably, I miscounted the carries or the digits. It's easy to make a mistake when doing it manually. So, the correct final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.

Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8, write down 8. So putting it together, we have 8,8,7,5,2. Wait, that would be 88752? Wait, let me check that again: 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo the result is 88752. Wait, but 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3 another way to verify. 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Wait, that's different from 88752. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n- 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo that gives 88752. But when I compute it as (30000 - 476) * 3, I get 90000 - 1428 = 88572, which is different. So there's a mistake here. Let me compute 29524 * 3 directly:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n3 * 4 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n3 * 5 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n3 * 9 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo that's 88752. But wait, using another method: 29524 + 29524 + 29524.\n\nLet me add 29524 + 29524:\n\n29524 + 29524:\n\n4 + 4 = 8\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 10, write down 0, carry over 1.\n\n9 + 9 + 1 = 19, write down 9, carry over 1.\n\n2 + 2 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo that's 59048.\n\nNow, add 59048 + 29524:\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\n8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nSo that's 88572. Wait, so which one is correct? The digit-by-digit gives 88752, but adding it three times gives 88572. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nLet me try again, step by step:\n\n29524\n\n*         3\n\n------------\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\nNext digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\nNext digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo that's 88752. But when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572. So where's the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated when adding 59048 + 29524. Let me check that again.\n\n59048 + 29524:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 + 4 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n0 + 5 = 5 \u2192 write 5.\n\n9 + 9 = 18 \u2192 write 8, carry 1.\n\n5 + 2 + 1 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo that gives 88572.\n\nWait, but 29524 * 3 should be 88572 because 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, my digit-by-digit multiplication must be wrong. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misaligned the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n*      3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo that's 88752. But when I add it up, it's 88572. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the addition method. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another approach.\n\nCompute 29524 * 3:\n\nBreak down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4.\n\nNow multiply each part by 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow add them all together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nSo that's correct. Therefore, my digit-by-digit multiplication was wrong. I must have made a mistake in the alignment. Let me try that again:\n\n29524\n*      3\n----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 write 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 write 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 write 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nWait, but that gives 88752, but we know it's 88572. So perhaps I'm miscounting the digits. Let me write it properly:\n\n29524\n*      3\n----------\n= 88572\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a digit or something. Let me check the positions:\n\nThe number is 2 9 5 2 4.\n\nMultiplying by 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12 \u2192 units place: 2, carry 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 tens place: 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 \u2192 hundreds place: 5, carry 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 \u2192 thousands place: 8, carry 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 \u2192 ten-thousands place: 8.\n\nSo that's 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Wait, but when I wrote it as 88752 earlier, I think I misplaced the digits. So actually, the correct result is 88572. Therefore, my initial digit-by-digit calculation was incorrect because I misaligned the digits. So, the correct final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, then 29524 * 3 = 88572. So that should be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me just make sure that I computed Layer 9 correctly. Let me go back through each layer to ensure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Each layer is computed correctly up to Layer 9 being 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, which is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Start with the innermost parentheses, compute each layer step by step.\n\n- Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer).\n\n- After computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, multiply by 3 to get the final result, which is 88572.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just check if there's a pattern or formula that could have been applied instead of computing each layer manually. Since each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4, perhaps this is a geometric series or follows some recurrence relation.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet's solve for A and B.\n\nGiven a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B\n\n= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B\n\nSubtract A*3^{n} from both sides:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides:\n\n-2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\na_1 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + (-1/2) = 4\n\nSo, 3A - 1/2 = 4\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides:\n\n3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\n\nSo, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\na_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is a_9, we have:\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, using the closed-form formula, we can compute it directly without computing each layer, which is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). After computing up to the ninth layer, we get 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4.\n2. Compute each subsequent layer:\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n3. Multiply the result of Layer 9 by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{88572}"

So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscalculate. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, that seems consistent.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems consistent. Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or miscalculate somewhere. Let me try an alternative approach to confirm the result. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. Let me compute each a_n step by step again to be thorough. a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that's the same result as before. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some kind of recursive sequence. Let me see: The general term seems to be a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. That's a linear recurrence relation. The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let's solve it. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. Therefore, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's another way to get the same result, which confirms that the answer is correct. Therefore, the computed value is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe expression is a nested series where each layer is defined as 1 + 3 times the previous layer. By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the outermost layer evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, which could have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1 as 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). Let me see if there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. And so on. So, in general, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. I remember that such recursions can often be solved using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. Plugging into the recurrence: L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p = 1 => L_p = -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition: When n=1, L_1=4. So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4, correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. So, this formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 -1 =59048. Then, 59048 /2 =29524, which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572, which is the same as before. So, this formula approach confirms my step-by-step computation. Therefore, the answer is 88572. But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula, let me check for n=4: L_4 should be (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, which is correct as per my earlier step-by-step. So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is of the form (3^{n} -1)/2, but since we started at n=1, it's (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Either way, the result is consistent. So, to recap, the problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step or by recognizing the pattern and using the formula for the nth term of the recurrence relation, I arrived at the final value of 29524 for the innermost expression, which is then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let's see if I can find a pattern or formula for a_n. The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. Let's compute the first few terms to see if a pattern emerges: a_1 = 4 a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 So, as I can see, each term is indeed growing exponentially, which makes sense because it's a linear recurrence relation with a coefficient greater than 1. To find a closed-form solution, I can solve the recurrence relation. The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is given by a_n = A*c^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. In this case, c = 3 and d = 1. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = A*3^n. For the particular solution, since d is a constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. n=3: (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^{10} is 59049. So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3.\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous term), repeated 9 times, then multiplied by 3.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the final layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. So, reading from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. So, the result is 88572. Wait, let me verify that: 29524 * 3: Let me compute 29524 * 3: 20000 * 3 = 60000 9000 * 3 = 27000 500 * 3 = 1500 20 * 3 = 60 4 * 3 = 12 Now, add them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 87000 + 1500 = 88500 88500 + 60 = 88560 88560 + 12 = 88572 Yes, that matches. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a lot. Let me recount each layer step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3 * 29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems consistent. But wait, another way to approach this problem might be to recognize a pattern or use a formula instead of computing each layer manually, especially since there are nine layers. Let me think about whether this is a geometric series or something else.\n\nLooking at each layer, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*a_n, where a_n is the nth term.\n\nWait, actually, the expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), which is similar to a geometric series but with a twist because each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1.\n\nLet me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) But the inner part is similar to E but without the outermost 3. Wait, no, because each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, perhaps it's better to think recursively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. Let me try to see if I can find a general formula for n layers.\n\nSuppose we have n layers of 1 + 3*(...), then the value would be something like (3^(n+1) - 3)/2. Wait, let me test this with n=1: (3^(2) - 3)/2 = (9 -3)/2= 6/2=3. But Layer 1 is 4, so that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the values I've computed:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nLooking at these numbers: 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524\n\nI notice that each term is 3 times the previous term minus something? Let me check:\n\nFrom 4 to 13: 4*3=12 +1=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFrom 13 to 40: 13*3=39 +1=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFrom 40 to 121: 40*3=120 +1=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFrom 121 to 364: 121*3=363 +1=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFrom 364 to 1093: 364*3=1092 +1=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFrom 1093 to 3280: 1093*3=3279 +1=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFrom 3280 to 9841: 3280*3=9840 +1=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFrom 9841 to 29524: 9841*3=29523 +1=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That seems to be the pattern. So, it's a linear recurrence relation where a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis kind of recurrence can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me find A and B. The homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\na_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1\n\nAssume a particular solution is B, then:\n\nB = 3*B + 1\n\nSolving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: (3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSince we have 9 layers, the innermost being Layer 1, the outermost being Layer 9.\n\nWait, but in our case, Layer 1 was the innermost, which is 1 + 3. So, when we computed Layer 9, it was (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the value of Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the final answer.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if we think of the entire expression as 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute that: 3^{11} is 177147. So, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, this confirms that the final answer is indeed 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and verified the calculations multiple times, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the pattern a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. Solving this recurrence relation gives us a formula for the nth layer: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. For the ninth layer, this results in 29524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n\n1. Compute each layer from the innermost (Layer 1) to the outermost (Layer 9):\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n2. Multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\nFinal Answer:\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me check: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, add another 29524: 59048 + 29524. Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Wait, that's different. So my previous calculation was wrong. Let me correct that. 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 = 59048, then 59048 + 29524: Let's add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. Then, 79048 + 9000 = 88048. Then, 88048 + 524 = 88572. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. Wait, but earlier when I did the digit-wise multiplication, I got 88752, which is incorrect. So, it's important to check the multiplication carefully. Let me try another method: 29524 * 3. Break it down as (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3. So, 20000 * 3 = 60000. 9000 * 3 = 27000. 500 * 3 = 1500. 20 * 3 = 60. 4 * 3 = 12. Now, add all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. But let me double-check all my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier.

Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem in a different way, perhaps using a formula for a geometric series or something similar, since the structure seems to repeat itself with each layer. Let me see. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with nine layers. Let me try to represent this recursively. Let\u2019s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3. Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2, up to a_9. Then, the final result is 3*a_9. So, we can compute a_1 through a_9 using this recurrence relation. Let me compute them again using this approach to confirm: a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13. a_3=1 +3*a_2=1+3*13=1+39=40. a_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +3*40=1+120=121. a_5=1+3*a_4=1+3*121=1+363=364. a_6=1+3*a_5=1+3*364=1+1092=1093. a_7=1+3*a_6=1+3*1093=1+3279=3280. a_8=1+3*a_7=1+3*3280=1+9840=9841. a_9=1+3*a_8=1+3*9841=1+29523=29524. Then, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, same result as before. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 =0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. Solving for C: C - 3C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, applying the initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: a_1= (3^{2})/2 -1/2=9/2 -1/2=8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3)/2 -1/2=27/2 -1/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(3^4)/2 -1/2=81/2 -1/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. This method confirms the answer again. So, I'm pretty confident that the answer is 88572. I think I've checked it thoroughly enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead to the same result. Therefore, the answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward.

Let me check that again: 29524 * 3: 29524 + 29524 + 29524. Let's add 29524 + 29524 first: 29524 + 29524 = 59048. Then, add 29524 to 59048: 59048 + 29524. Let's add step by step: 59048 + 20000 = 79048. 79048 + 9524 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers.

Wait, let me check that again because I might have messed up the digits. 29524: the digits are 2 (ten thousands place), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, multiplying each by 3:\n\n- Units: 4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1.\n- Tens: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7.\n- Hundreds: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1.\n- Thousands: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2.\n- Ten thousands: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 88572.

Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

Wait, 29524 * 3: Let me check with another method. 29524 * 3: 30000 * 3 = 90000, minus (30000 - 29524) * 3. 30000 - 29524 = 476. So, 476 * 3 = 1428. Therefore, 90000 - 1428 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Layer 2:1+3*4=13. Layer3:1+3*13=40. Layer4:1+3*40=121. Layer5:1+3*121=364. Layer6:1+3*364=1093. Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. Then, 3*29524=88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, the sequence goes 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524, and then multiplied by 3. So, the nth term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has a characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, using the formula for the linear recurrence. That's a good way to verify the result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step, we find the value of the innermost expression and work our way out. After computing the innermost layers, we find that the outermost expression evaluates to 88572.\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"
