    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, that becomes:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), which is:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on a second. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply that result by 3.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524, so the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 3*29,000 is 87,000, and 3*524 is 1,572. So adding those together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But maybe I should try a different approach to verify. Sometimes, when dealing with nested expressions like this, there's a pattern or a formula that can be used instead of computing each layer individually. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. So, in mathematical terms, each Layer n = 3*(Layer n-1) + 1.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrence relations.\n\nThe general form of such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = r*a_{n-1} + c\n\nIn this case, r = 3 and c = 1.\n\nThe solution to such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nWait, let me check that formula again. I think it's:\n\na_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^{n} - 1)/(r - 1)\n\nBut in our case, a_0 would be the initial term when n=0. However, in our problem, Layer 1 is 4, which is when n=1. So maybe I need to adjust the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as starting from n=0.\n\nLet me redefine the layers as starting from n=0.\n\nLet\u2019s say Layer 0 is 1, then Layer 1 is 1 + 3*Layer0 = 1 + 3*1 = 4, which matches.\n\nThen, Layer 2 = 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on.\n\nSo, in this case, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=0, a_0 = 1.\n\nSo, 1 = A*3^0 - 1/2 => 1 = A*1 - 1/2 => A = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers. Let me confirm:\n\nLayer 1: n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: n=2, a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: n=3, a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. So, for Layer 9, which is n=9, the value would be a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring.\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, let me compute that again: 29524 * 3.\n\nCompute 29,000 * 3 = 87,000\n\nCompute 524 * 3 = 1,572\n\nAdd them together: 87,000 + 1,572 = 88,572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final result is 88,572.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try computing one more layer manually to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the formula.\n\nCompute Layer 4 using the formula: a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches my earlier computation. So, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, I can be confident that the result is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nAfter computing Layer 9, we multiply the result by 3:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. That's 1 + 120, which equals 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Let's calculate 3*9000 = 27000, 3*841 = 2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression starts with 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, let me compute 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. Now, adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's compute 29524*3:\n\n- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n- 9*3 = 27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n- 2*3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n- The remaining digits are 2 and 9, but wait, 29524 is a five-digit number: 2,9,5,2,4. So, starting from the right:\n\n- 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n- 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7.\n- 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n- 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n- 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8.\n- There's no more digits, so the result is 88572. That matches my previous calculation. So, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any miscalculations. Starting from the innermost parentheses, each layer was computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. I went through each layer one by one, computing the value step by step, and then finally multiplied the outermost layer by 3 to get the final result. Each step seemed straightforward, and I double-checked the multiplication at the end. I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each layer's value is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. Layer 2: 1 + 3\u00d74 = 13\n3. Layer 3: 1 + 3\u00d713 = 40\n4. Layer 4: 1 + 3\u00d740 = 121\n5. Layer 5: 1 + 3\u00d7121 = 364\n6. Layer 6: 1 + 3\u00d7364 = 1093\n7. Layer 7: 1 + 3\u00d71093 = 3280\n8. Layer 8: 1 + 3\u00d73280 = 9841\n9. Layer 9: 1 + 3\u00d79841 = 29524\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n3 \u00d7 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3*(...), and the ... is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. Let me do that: 3 * 29524. Hmm, let's compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000 * 3 = 60000, 9000 * 3 = 27000, 500 * 3 = 1500, 20 * 3 = 60, and 4 * 3 = 12.

So, I think my approach is correct because I computed each layer up to Layer 9, which is the innermost part, and then the outermost part is 3 times that. But wait, let me check the structure again.\n\nThe original problem is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9). So, my calculation of 3*29524 = 88572 should be correct.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step, maybe a geometric series or something like that. Because computing nine layers manually seems tedious, and it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLooking at each layer, it's of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a function of the previous one. Let me denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost.\n\nSo, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to L_9.\n\nWait, this seems like a recurrence relation where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1 = 4.\n\nIf I can find a closed-form formula for L_n, that would make it easier to compute without having to calculate each layer manually.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4.\n\nWhen n=1, L_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSo, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works. So, using this formula, I can compute L_9 directly without computing each layer.\n\nCompute L_9: (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so L_9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check 3^10 to be sure. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, L_9=29524, then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for L_n, the outermost expression is 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2, where n=9. So, 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147, so (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, which is the same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the closed-form solution, I end up with the same answer: 88572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the multiple methods all lead to the same result, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward, we find that each layer follows a recurrence relation. Using the closed-form formula for the nth layer, we determine the value of the outermost expression.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 becomes: Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, that's 13. Next, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, plugging in 13: Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Okay, 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that: 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total value is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: 1. 1 + 3 = 4\n2. 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable manually. Alternatively, I can think of each layer as following a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, which matches my earlier calculation. Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, and so on. This is a linear recurrence relation, and perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The general solution for such a recurrence relation is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let me try to find A and B. Given that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. Let's assume the solution is a_n = A*3^{n} + B. Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B). Simplify the right-hand side: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. So, the equation becomes: A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B. Subtracting A*3^{n} from both sides: B = 1 + 3B. Subtracting 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4.5 = 3A => A = 4.5 / 3 = 1.5. So, A = 3/2. Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the earlier computed values. For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let me compute that. 3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier result for Layer 9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, using the closed-form formula, I also arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula give me the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nWe define each layer as follows:\n- Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n- Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n- Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n- Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n- Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n- Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n- Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n- Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n- Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times Layer 9:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving outward to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so this is 1 + 3*13. Calculating 3*13 gives 39, and then 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. So, Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5).

That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This looks like a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively.\n\nLet me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13.\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where A and C are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nTo find C, let's consider the steady-state solution where a_n = a_{n-1} = C.\n\nSo, C = 1 + 3*C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2.\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I got earlier.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about this problem. Let me consider that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, starting from the innermost layer, each step is 3*(previous) +1. So, if I think of it as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added, perhaps I can model it as a sum.\n\nBut in this case, since each term depends on the previous one, it's more of a recursive sequence rather than a simple geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a base-3 number or something, but I don't see an immediate connection.\n\nWait, another approach: since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), and we have 9 layers, maybe the total expression can be represented as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 ones. So, the value inside is a_9, and the total is 3*a_9.\n\nBut we've already computed that a_9 is 29524, so 3*a_9 is 88572.\n\nI think I've verified it enough ways. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward.

Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). 3*3280 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). 3*9841 is 29523. Adding 1 gives 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I need to multiply that by 3.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, let's do this step by step. 29524*3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60000.\n\nThen, 9000 * 3 = 27000.\n\n500 * 3 = 1500.\n\n20 * 3 = 60.\n\n4 * 3 = 12.\n\nNow, adding all these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000.\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500.\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560.\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 29524*3 should be 88572? Let me verify that with another method to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as follows:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 is 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, plus the carried 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6, plus the carried 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, putting it together: 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the entire expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous steps because that seems like a lot of layers, and it's easy to make an error.\n\nStarting again from Layer 1:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct.\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572. Correct.\n\nSo, after verifying each layer, it seems like my calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we evaluate each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost expression:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n2. Substitute back and compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   1 + 3(13) &= 1 + 39 = 40 \\\\\n   1 + 3(40) &= 1 + 120 = 121 \\\\\n   1 + 3(121) &= 1 + 363 = 364 \\\\\n   1 + 3(364) &= 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\\\\n   1 + 3(1093) &= 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\\\\n   1 + 3(3280) &= 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\\\\n   1 + 3(9841) &= 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n4. Finally, multiply the outermost result by 3:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

Because the entire expression is 3*(...), where ... is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final result would be 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 * 29524 = ?\n\nWell, 29524 * 3.

Yep, that matches my previous result.\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when doing this step by step. Let me go through each layer again quickly.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOkay, seems consistent. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula.\n\nLooking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each subsequent term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. This seems like a geometric sequence or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nLet me define a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nWait, but in our case, the innermost layer is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, and so on up to a_9, which is 29524. Then the total expression is 3*a_9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, so the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 =88572, as before.\n\nSo, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1. So, starting from 1, each step is 3*previous +1. But in this case, the innermost term is 1 +3, so it's similar.\n\nWait, actually, in our case, the innermost term is 1 +3, which is 4, then each subsequent term is 1 +3*(previous term). So, it's the same as a_n = 1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. So, using the formula we derived, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, starting from n=1 as 4.\n\nBut in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Then, 3*a_9=88572.\n\nYes, that all checks out.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this problem from multiple angles, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost to the outermost.\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Moving on to Layer 4: Layer 4 = 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 Layer 5 is 364.

So, Layer 1 is 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). We just found Layer 1 is 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Adding 1 gives us 40. Layer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121. Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). 3*364 is 1092. Adding 1 gives 1093.

Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). We just found Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 is... Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524 is 88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers.

Then, each subsequent term is built upon the previous one. Let me see if there's a formula for such a sequence. The general form of a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c can be solved, but in this case, it's a simple recursion where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term.\n\nThe formula for such a recurrence is a geometric series. Let's see, if I have a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, the nth term can be expressed as a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, for a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3, starting from 1, the sum would be (3^{n} - 1)/2. Let me test this formula with the layers I computed.\n\nFor n=1: (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 -1)/2 = 1, but our a_1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe the formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test that.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works! So, the nth term a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Therefore, for Layer 9, which is the 9th term, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that.\n\n3^10 is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, using the formula, I can confirm that each layer follows a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, starting from 4. This makes the computation much easier because instead of calculating each layer step by step, I can use the formula to find the 9th term directly.\n\nBut since I was able to compute each layer step by step and arrived at the same result, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. It's always good to verify using different methods to ensure accuracy, especially with such a lengthy computation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each time we add a layer, we're essentially multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 1. That's exactly what we did step by step, so it's consistent.\n\nIn summary, by working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, I was able to compute the value of the entire expression step by step, verifying each layer as I went. Using the formula for the nth term of the series also confirmed the result. Therefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is: \n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is \\(3 \\times \\text{Layer 9}\\):\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 = 4. So, Layer 1 equals 4.\n\nNow, moving to Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that. 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 equals 13. So, Layer 2 is 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 is 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 3*40 is 120. Adding 1 gives us 121. Therefore, Layer 4 is 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 3*121 is 363. Adding 1 gives 364. So, Layer 5 is 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 3*364 is... let's see, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, adding 1 gives 1093. So, Layer 6 is 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 3*1093 is... 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Adding 1 gives 3280. Therefore, Layer 7 is 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 3*3280 is... 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 is 9840. Adding 1 gives 9841. So, Layer 8 is 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 3*9841 is... let's compute that. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is... wait, 841*3: 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3, so 2400+120+3=2523. So, 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression starts with 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is... let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total expression equals 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's verify each layer step by step to ensure accuracy.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9841 is 9000 + 800 + 40 + 1. So, 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. Adding these together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. Correct.\n\nFinally, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the original expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 29524. So, 3*29524=88572. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been applied here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved to find a general formula for L_n. Let's see if I can find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is found by solving L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence because of the constant term 1.\n\nThe general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.\n\nFirst, find the homogeneous solution: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, where C is a constant.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant.\n\nSubstitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A.\n\nSolving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nFor n=2: L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct.\n\nFor n=3: L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct.\n\nFor n=4: L_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2=121. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: L_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nFor n=6: L_6 = (3^7 -1)/2= (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nFor n=7: L_7 = (3^8 -1)/2= (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nFor n=8: L_8 = (3^9 -1)/2= (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nFor n=9: L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(L_9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*L_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147. Then, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. So, that's another way to compute it, and it confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough times, and both methods\u2014step-by-step computation and using the closed-form formula\u2014give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be simplified by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). Using a recurrence relation, we find a closed-form formula to compute each layer efficiently. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer**: Starting from the innermost layer (Layer 1) and moving outward, compute each layer using the formula Layer_n = 1 + 3*(Layer_{n-1}).\n\n3. **Use a Recurrence Formula**: Recognize the recurrence relation L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} with L_1 = 4. Solve it to find L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Calculate the Outermost Layer**: Compute Layer 9 using the formula, which gives L_9 = 29524.\n\n5. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe value of the expression is $\\boxed{88572}$."

So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Hmm, 29524 times 3. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 29524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. 2*3=6 +1=7. 5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. 2*3=6 +2=8. So, putting it all together: 88572. Wait, let me verify that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\nNow, adding those together:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.

Correct.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}.\n\nThis is a recursive relation. Let me write it down:\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nSo, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\nLet me solve the recurrence relation.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B\n\nSolving for B:\n\nB = 1 + 3B\n\nSubtract 3B from both sides: -2B = 1 => B = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdd 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when computing each layer step by step. So, that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nSo, the final answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for a_n, we can compute a_9 directly and then multiply by 3.\n\nBut I think the step-by-step approach was sufficient and helped me verify each layer without making any mistakes. It's easy to get lost in the layers, but by methodically computing each one, I can ensure accuracy.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute a_9 using the formula and then 3*a_9.\n\na_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nThen, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of a geometric series, but given that each layer is defined recursively, the approach I took seems appropriate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression but with an additive constant. However, the formula I derived using the recurrence relation seems to handle it well.\n\nIn any case, both methods\u2014computing each layer step by step and using the closed-form formula\u2014lead me to the same result of 88572.

    "text": " Let me confirm: The innermost parentheses is 1 + 3, then the next one is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on, until the outermost layer. So, I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, substituting Layer 1: 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let me compute 3*121: 121*3. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So, Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me calculate 3*364. 300*3 = 900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. So, 3*1093 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let me calculate 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. So, 3*3280 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that's 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let me break it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4. Then Layer 2: 1+3*4=13. Layer 3: 1+3*13=40. Layer 4: 1+3*40=121. Layer 5: 1+3*121=364. Layer 6: 1+3*364=1093. Layer 7: 1+3*1093=3280. Layer 8: 1+3*3280=9841. Layer 9: 1+3*9841=29524.

So after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So I need to compute 3*29524.\n\nCalculating 3*29524: Let's do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000=60000\n\nThen, 3*9000=27000, so 60000+27000=87000\n\nNext, 3*500=1500, so 87000+1500=88500\n\nThen, 3*20=60, so 88500+60=88560\n\nFinally, 3*4=12, so 88560+12=88572.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculation again because I might have made a mistake in breaking it down.\n\nWait, 29524 is the number, so 3*29524.\n\nAnother way: 29524 * 3.\n\nLet me compute it digit by digit:\n\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nNo more digits, so write down the 8.\n\nWait, that gives us 88572. Hmm, but let me verify with another method.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*      3\n--------\nLet's compute each digit:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nBut wait, that seems too large. Let me check the previous steps because maybe I made a mistake in computing Layer 9.\n\nWait, Layer 9 was 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841.\n\nSo 3*9841: Let me compute that again.\n\n9841 * 3:\n\n1*3=3\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2.\n\n9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2.\n\nBut since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2.\n\nWait, that gives 29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. That's correct.\n\nSo Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step, but perhaps there's a pattern or a formula I can use. Alternatively, maybe I can express this as a geometric series or something similar.\n\nWait, let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3a_2, and so on up to a_9.\n\nSo the general formula is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. Let's see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C.\n\nSolving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4.\n\nSo when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4.\n\nSolving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{10} is 59049, so a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I got earlier. So Layer 9 is indeed 29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the number of layers is correctly accounted for. The original expression has nine layers of (1+3(...)), right? So a_9 is the innermost, and the outermost is 3*a_9. So the final result is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, let me check by computing each layer again to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nThen 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, using the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, for n=9, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute 3*29524 in another way to confirm.\n\nLet me compute 29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n*     3\n--------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2 (from 29) *3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo writing it down: 88572.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to a recurrence relation. Using the closed-form solution of the recurrence relation, we find the value of the innermost layer and then compute the final result by multiplying by 3.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: The expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. This forms a recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: Let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\n3. **Closed-form Solution**: Solving the recurrence gives a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\n4. **Compute the Innermost Layer (n=9)**: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: Multiply a_9 by 3: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{88572}$"

Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, just to verify.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\n\nLayer 2: 13\n\nLayer 3: 40\n\nLayer 4: 121\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nI notice that each layer is roughly multiplying by 3 each time and adding 1. Let's see:\n\nFrom Layer 1 to Layer 2: 4*3 +1=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2 to Layer 3:13*3 +1=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3 to Layer 4:40*3 +1=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that's consistent. So each layer n is 3*(layer n-1) +1.\n\nSo, if I denote L(n) as the value of layer n, then L(n) = 3*L(n-1) +1, with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for L(n), which might help in computing higher layers without manually calculating each step.\n\nThe recurrence relation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) +1, with L(1)=4.\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation: L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n.\n\nNext, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_p(n) = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A +1.\n\nSolving for A: A - 3A = 1 \u2192 -2A =1 \u2192 A = -1/2.\n\nThus, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L(1)=4.\n\nSo, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 \u2192 4 = 3C -1/2 \u2192 3C = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 \u2192 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.\n\nSimplify: L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2= (27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2= (81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2= (243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2= (729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2= (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2= (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2= (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2= (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula works. Therefore, for each layer n, L(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nSo, the innermost layer is n=1, and the outermost is n=9, giving L(9)=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L(9) =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, L(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524.\n\nThus, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, let me compute 3*29524 again just to be absolutely sure.\n\n29524 *3:\n\n4*3=12 \u2192 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15 \u21925, carryover1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28 \u21928, carryover2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, 88572. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524*3: 29524*3 can be computed as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428=88572. That's another way to check.\n\nSo, all steps seem correct. Therefore, the computed value is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe computed value is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given problem, we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer as follows:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we compute the outermost expression:\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the computed value is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's simple. 1 + 3 equals 4. So Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving one layer out, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3 times Layer 2. So that's 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Layer 3 = 40.\n\nProceeding to Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3. So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4. That's 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5. So, 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, plus 1 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6. That's 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7. So, 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8. That's 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 3*9841 = 29523. Then, adding 1 gives 29524. So Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait a minute, but the original expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nSo, let me compute that: 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 equals 88572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I can compute 29524*3 in another way. Let's do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n?\n\nStarting from the right:\n4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2*3=6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n9*3=27, plus 1 is 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n2*3=6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Yep, that matches what I had before. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me go back through each layer to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous calculations. It's easy to make an arithmetic error when dealing with so many layers.\n\nStarting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*40=120, 3*1=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, each layer seems to compute correctly. Therefore, the final result is 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as 3(1+3(...)), so each time, it's 3 multiplied by the next parentheses. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, when I computed each layer, I was correctly following that pattern. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the layers:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\nLayer 5: 364\nLayer 6: 1093\nLayer 7: 3280\nLayer 8: 9841\nLayer 9: 29524\n\nHmm, let's see if there's a pattern in the numbers. From Layer 1 to Layer 2: 4 to 13. The difference is 9. From 13 to 40: difference is 27. From 40 to 121: difference is 81. From 121 to 364: difference is 243. From 364 to 1093: difference is 729. From 1093 to 3280: difference is 2187. From 3280 to 9841: difference is 6561. From 9841 to 29524: difference is 19683.\n\nWait a second, those differences look familiar: 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561, 19683. Each of these is 3 raised to a power: 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. So, each layer's value is the previous value plus 3 raised to an increasing power. That seems to fit.\n\nSo, if I denote the value of Layer n as L(n), then L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). So, each layer is built upon the previous one by multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for L(n).\n\nThe recurrence relation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1) = 4.\n\nThis is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. Plugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 3*A + 1\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nApplying the initial condition L(1) = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2\n4 = 3C - 1/2\n3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2\nC = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, the general formula is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1: (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) - 1)/2.\n\nIn our problem, we have 9 layers, so Layer 9 is (3^(10) -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, using both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nI think I've double-checked each step, and the formula seems to hold, so I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It was a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a general formula helped solidify that the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start by recognizing the nested structure and compute each layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\nThe expression is:\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe label each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9**: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nThe entire expression is 3 times the outermost layer (Layer 9):\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{88572}\n\\]"

Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me check the multiplication again to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n\n5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, writing it out: 88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me compute 29524 * 3 using another method to verify.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, adding them:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSame result. Okay, so that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time we add 1 and multiply by 3. Wait, but in this case, it's not exactly a geometric series because each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Let me see if I can model this.\n\nLet me denote a_n as the value at layer n. So,\n\na_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n.\n\nThe general solution for such a recurrence is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} + C\n\nWhere A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a constant particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's find the particular solution. Assume a_n = C.\n\nThen, substituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nSo, the general solution is:\n\na_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is:\n\na_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, for n = 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10:\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier. So, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me compute each layer again using the closed-form formula.\n\nFor n=1, a_1 = (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3, a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4, a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5, a_5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6, a_6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7, a_7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8, a_8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9, a_9=(3^10 -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers check out. Therefore, the final computation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't see the pattern initially, I could have just computed each layer step by step, which I did, and it also led me to the same result. So, both methods confirm that the value of the expression is 88572.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work thoroughly. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). By computing each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that the value of the innermost layer is 4. Each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer up to the ninth layer, which results in 29524. Finally, multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer.\n\nStep-by-step computation:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6.

Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiplying Layer 9 by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n\\boxed{88572}"

Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nMoving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3 times Layer 2.

Because the outermost part is 3 times the big parentheses, which is Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the final step is to multiply that by 3.\n\nSo, 3 * 29524.

But let me try a different approach to confirm. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think about it.\n\nIf I denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number from 1 to 9, then each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. Starting with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition.\n\nWait, let me recall. The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n, and the particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution L_n^{(p)} = K. Substituting into the equation:\n\nK = 3*K + 1 \u21d2 K - 3K = 1 \u21d2 -2K = 1 \u21d2 K = -1/2.\n\nSo the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \u21d2 4 = 3C - 1/2 \u21d2 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \u21d2 C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the layers I computed earlier:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! So the formula holds for each layer. Therefore, Layer 9 is indeed 29524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me compute 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 for n=9. Let me see:\n\n3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nWait, 3^{11} is 177147, so (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have thought of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). But either way, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute 3*29524:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n29524\n\u00d7    3\n--------\n88572\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested multiplication problem that can be solved by working from the innermost parentheses outward.

Alternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7, write down 7.\n9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2.\n2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8, write down 8.\nSo, reading from top to bottom, it's 88572. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each layer is computed by taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is then multiplied by 3. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the intermediate steps. Let's go through them again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAnd then 3*29524 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, all the layers check out. So, I think I did this correctly. Each step builds on the previous one, and since each layer was computed correctly, the final result should be accurate. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression step by step, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The expression is:\n\n\\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \\]\n\nWe compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost:\n\n1. Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, we multiply the result of the outermost layer by 3:\n\n\\[ 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nOkay, that's simple enough. Now, moving out one layer:\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4\n\nLet me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nAlright, Layer 2 is 13. Now, Layer 3:\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13\n\nCalculating that: 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4:\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40\n\n3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 4 is 121. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer seems to be following a certain progression. Let me see if I can find a formula or a pattern that might help me compute these layers more quickly instead of calculating each one manually. Let's list out the layers I've computed so far:\n\nLayer 1: 4\nLayer 2: 13\nLayer 3: 40\nLayer 4: 121\n\nWait a second, 4, 13, 40, 121... These numbers look familiar. Let me see if there's a recurrence relation here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, in mathematical terms, Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). That seems to be the case. So, if I can model this as a recurrence relation, maybe I can find a closed-form formula or at least compute it more efficiently.\n\nLet me try to compute the next few layers to see if the pattern continues.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 5: 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 6: 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 7: 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 8: 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify that. 3*9841 is 29523, and adding 1 gives 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the total value is 3*29524.\n\nCalculating that: 3*29524. Let's do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 3*20000 = 60000\nThen, 3*9000 = 27000\n3*500 = 1500\n3*24 = 72\n\nAdding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, 29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3 = 12, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n5*3=15, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n9*3=27, carryover 2\n5*3=15 +2=17, carryover 1\n2*3=6 +1=7\n9*3=27, carryover 2\n2*3=6 +2=8\n\nWait, let me write it out properly:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n--------\nStarting from the units place:\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write down 7\n9\u00d73=27, write down 7, carryover 2\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write down 8\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 87572.\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d73:\n\nLet me do it digit by digit:\n\nUnits place: 4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nTens place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nHundreds place: 5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nThousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nTen-thousands place: 9\u00d73=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\nHundred-thousands place: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nWait, so my initial step-by-step addition was wrong because I broke it into parts incorrectly. The correct value is 87572.\n\nHmm, so I think I messed up the addition when I was adding 60000 + 27000 + 1500 +72. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 60000 + 27000 is indeed 87000. Then, 87000 + 1500 is 88500. Then, 88500 +72 is 88572. But when I did the digit-by-digit multiplication, I got 87572. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication.\n\nWait, let's do it again:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nNext digit: 5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\nNext digit: 9\u00d73=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 87572.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, why the discrepancy?\n\nBecause when I broke it into parts, I did 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. But 20000 +9000 +500 +24 is 29524, which is correct. So, adding 60000 +27000 is 87000, then 87000 +1500 is 88500, then 88500 +72 is 88572.\n\nBut wait, when I do the digit-by-digit, I get 87572. Which is different. So, one of them must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me verify.\n\nWait, 29524 \u00d73:\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, so units digit is 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, tens digit is 7.\n\nNext digit: 5\u00d73=15, hundreds digit is 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7, thousands digit is 7.\n\nNext digit: 9\u00d73=27, ten-thousands digit is 7, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8, hundred-thousands digit is 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nBut when I did the other method, I got 88572. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 \u00d73 using another method. Let's break 29524 into 20000 +9000 +500 +24.\n\nSo, 3\u00d720000=60000\n\n3\u00d79000=27000\n\n3\u00d7500=1500\n\n3\u00d724=72\n\nAdding them up: 60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +72=88572\n\nWait, so this method gives 88572, whereas the digit-by-digit multiplication gave me 87572. So, there must be a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Let me check the number of digits.\n\nWait, 29524 is a 5-digit number. So, when I multiply by 3, the result should be a 5 or 6-digit number. Let me compute 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nCompute each digit:\n\n- 4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n- 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n- 5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n- 2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n- 9\u00d73=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n- 2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, writing it out: 87572.\n\nWait, that's correct because 29524 \u00d73 is indeed 88572 or 87572? Wait, let me compute it using a different approach.\n\nLet me compute 29524 \u00d73:\n\nFirst, compute 29524 \u00d73:\n\n29524 \u00d73:\n\nStart from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n\n9\u00d73=27, write 7, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572.\n\nBut when I did the other method, adding 60000 +27000 +1500 +72, I got 88572.\n\nWait a minute, that can't be. There must be a mistake in how I broke down the number. Let me check:\n\n29524 is equal to 20000 +9000 +500 +24.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3\u00d720000=60000\n\n3\u00d79000=27000\n\n3\u00d7500=1500\n\n3\u00d724=72\n\nAdding them: 60000 +27000=87000\n\n87000 +1500=88500\n\n88500 +72=88572\n\nWait, so that's 88572.\n\nBut when I do the digit-by-digit multiplication, I get 87572. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method. Let me try another way. Let me compute 29524 \u00d73 using the standard multiplication algorithm:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\n\u00d7        3\n-----------\nStarting from the right:\n\n4\u00d73=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7, write 7.\n\n5\u00d73=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8, write 8.\n\nSo, writing it from top to bottom: 8 7 5 7 2.\n\nWait, that's 87572. But when I broke it down, I got 88572.\n\nWait, so which one is correct? Let me compute 29524 \u00d73 using another method, like adding 29524 three times.\n\n29524 +29524=59048\n\n59048 +29524=88572\n\nAh, so the correct result is 88572. So, where did I go wrong in the digit-by-digit multiplication?\n\nWait, in the digit-by-digit method, I think I may have miscounted the digits. Let me write it out properly:\n\n   2 9 5 2 4\n\u00d7        3\n-----------\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n4\u00d73=12 \u2192 write 2, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +1=7 \u2192 write 7.\n\nNext digit: 5\u00d73=15 \u2192 write 5, carryover 1.\n\nNext digit: 9\u00d73=27 +1=28 \u2192 write 8, carryover 2.\n\nNext digit: 2\u00d73=6 +2=8 \u2192 write 8.\n\nSo, the result is 87572. But when I add 29524 three times, I get 88572. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute 29524 \u00d73 using a calculator to verify.\n\n29524 \u00d73: 29524 \u00d73 = 88572.\n\nSo, the correct result is 88572. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit multiplication. Perhaps I miscounted the digits or missed a carryover.\n\nSo, the correct total is 88572.\n\nWait, so going back, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed Layer 9 as 29524, that was correct because Layer 9 =1 +3*(Layer 8)=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nSo, that part was correct. Then, 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to confirm.\n\nLayer 1: 1 +3=4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, all layers up to Layer 9 are correct. Therefore, 3*29524=88572 is the correct result.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the digit-by-digit multiplication gave me 87572, but when I added 29524 three times, I got 88572. So, I think I must have made a mistake in the digit-by-digit method by misaligning the digits or missing a carryover.\n\nTherefore, the correct final result is 88572.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Start with the innermost layer: 1 +3=4.\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result: 1 +3*(previous layer).\n\n3. After computing all nine layers, Layer 9 is 29524.\n\n4. Multiply this result by 3 to get the final answer: 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the given expression is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested set of terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. By computing each layer from the innermost outward, we find that the expression evaluates to 88572.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a series of nested terms of the form 1 + 3*(...), with nine layers.\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply the outermost layer by 3**:\n   - 3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer**: The value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}."

    "text": " Let me confirm: The innermost parentheses is (1 + 3), then moving outward, each is (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, the structure is like a tree with each node being 1 + 3*(child node). Since there are nine layers of parentheses, I need to compute each one step by step. Let me write each layer as I compute it. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So 363 + 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's calculate 3*364: 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, because the original expression is 3*(...). So, compute 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Wait, no, that's not the right breakdown. Let me correct that. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. So, 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify each step because that seems like a lot. Maybe I made a calculation error somewhere. Let me go back through each layer to check. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Then, 3*29524: Let me compute that again. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down differently. 29524 * 3: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. That seems consistent. Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as (29000 + 524) * 3 = 29000*3 + 524*3 = 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Yes, same result. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\n\\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"

Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. Got it. Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So, 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3*3000 is 9000, 3*200 is 600, 3*80 is 240. Adding them: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. Let me calculate that. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*20 is 60, and 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.

    "text": " Let me check: The innermost parentheses is 1 + 3, then moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on. So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Let's start with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate 3*13 first: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, interesting. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Layer 1: 4, Layer 2:13, Layer3:40. Let me compute Layer 4 to see if the pattern continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40=120, so 1 + 120=121. Layer 4:121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121)=1 + 363=364. Layer 5:364. Layer 6:1 + 3*(364)=1 + 1092=1093. Layer 6:1093. Layer 7:1 + 3*(1093)=1 + 3279=3280. Layer 7:3280. Layer 8:1 + 3*(3280)=1 + 9840=9841. Layer 8:9841. Layer 9:1 + 3*(9841)=1 + 29523=29524. Layer 9:29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final step is to compute 3*29524. Let's do that: 3*29524. Let me break it down: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Now, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 72 = 88572. So, 3*29524=88572. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9: Layer1:4, Layer2:13, Layer3:40, Layer4:121, Layer5:364, Layer6:1093, Layer7:3280, Layer8:9841, Layer9:29524. Then 3*29524=88572. Let me verify Layer 5: 3*40=120, 1+120=121. Then Layer6:3*121=363, 1+363=364. Correct. Layer7:3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093. Correct. Layer8:3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280. Correct. Layer9:3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841. Wait, hold on, that's not right. Wait, Layer9 is 1 + 3*(Layer8). Layer8 is 9841, so 3*9841=29523, then 1+29523=29524. That's correct. Then 3*29524=88572. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4. So, it's a recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the formula for linear recurrence relations. The general solution for a recurrence like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. Let me try that. Here, k=3, c=1. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B. Solving for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. Now, applying initial condition a_1=4: 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Let's test this formula with the layers we computed earlier. For n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. For n=2: a_2=(3^{3}-1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. For n=3: a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. For n=4: a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. So, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is a_9. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. So, (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what we got earlier for Layer9. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. So, that confirms the result. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. Let me see. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which can be written as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9, but wait, that might not be exactly correct because each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but let me check. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), so when you expand it, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) which would be 3*1 + 3^2*1 + 3^3*1 + ... up to 9 terms. Wait, but let's see. Let me try to expand the expression step by step. Let's denote E as the entire expression: E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) Let me expand it step by step. Starting from the innermost: Let me define E1 = 1 + 3 =4.\n\nThen E2 = 1 + 3*E1 =1 + 12=13.\n\nE3=1 + 3*E2=1 +39=40.\n\nE4=1 +3*E3=1 +120=121.\n\nE5=1 +3*E4=1 +363=364.\n\nE6=1 +3*E5=1 +1092=1093.\n\nE7=1 +3*E6=1 +3279=3280.\n\nE8=1 +3*E7=1 +9840=9841.\n\nE9=1 +3*E8=1 +29523=29524.\n\nThen E =3*E9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, but let me see if that applies here. Wait, each layer is 1 + 3*previous, which is a linear recurrence, not a geometric series, but the solution to the recurrence is a geometric progression. So, the formula we derived earlier is indeed a geometric series in terms of 3^n.\n\nSo, the total expression is 3*(sum from n=0 to 8 of 3^n). Wait, let me think about that. Wait, the formula for a_n is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2. Then, E=3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute that: 3^{11}=177147. So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, another way to compute it is to recognize that the expression is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ), which simplifies to (3^{11} -3)/2=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88,572.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the step-by-step expansion and the formula using the recurrence relation give the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression that can be solved by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer (Layer 1) is 4, and each subsequent layer builds on the previous one. After computing all nine layers, the outermost expression is 3 times Layer 9, which equals 88,572.\n\n**Answer:**  \n$\\boxed{88572}$"

So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Let's define each layer as follows: Let\u2019s denote L1 = 1 + 3 L2 = 1 + 3*L1 L3 = 1 + 3*L2 ... Up to L9. But wait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(...). So, actually, the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8), and so on. So, perhaps I should compute L1 first, then L2, up to L9, and then multiply by 3. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost layer:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThen, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nThen, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524\n\nCalculating that: 29524 * 3\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.\n\n5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1.\n\n9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2.\n\n2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.\n\nSo, reading from top to bottom: 88572\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure.\n\n29524 * 3:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n4*3=12, write 2, carry 1.\n\n2*3=6+1=7, write 7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carry 1.\n\n9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carry 2.\n\n2*3=6+2=8, write 8.\n\nSo yes, it's 88572.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another method. Let's break it down:\n\n29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3\n\n= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3\n\n= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the layers. Let me go through each layer again to check.\n\nStarting with L1:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nL9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, L9 is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. Therefore, the final answer should be 88572.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about whether there's a pattern or formula that could simplify this computation without having to calculate each layer manually. Since each layer is defined by L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, this is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution for L_n. Let's explore that.\n\nThe recurrence relation is:\n\nL_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence as:\n\nL_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n.\n\nNext, we look for a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nA - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, apply the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L_1=4.\n\nSo,\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nThus, the general solution is:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nLet me verify this formula with the values I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: L3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: L4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: L5=(3^6 -1)/2=(729-1)/2=728/2=364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=6: L6=(3^7 -1)/2=(2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=7: L7=(3^8 -1)/2=(6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=8: L8=(3^9 -1)/2=(19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=9: L9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, the formula works perfectly. So, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, as I calculated before.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*(29524) = 88572, as I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. Let's compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nThus, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression. It gives the same result, which confirms that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI think I've thoroughly checked this problem. I broke it down step by step, computed each layer manually, then found a general formula to confirm the result. Both methods led me to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \\( L_n = 1 + 3 \\times L_{n-1} \\), starting with \\( L_1 = 4 \\). By computing each subsequent layer up to \\( L_9 \\), we find that \\( L_9 = 29524 \\). Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer:\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, moving one layer out: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nNext layer: Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit off. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (That's correct.)\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 (Still correct.)\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 (Okay, that's right.)\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nHmm, that seems like a big number, but let me verify if I did each step correctly.\n\nLet me list each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nWait a second, that seems correct, but let me check if I miscounted the layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, from the innermost to the outermost, there are nine layers. I counted up to Layer 9, so that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each layer manually, especially since it's easy to make an arithmetic error with so many steps.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote L_n as the nth layer, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, where L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a recursive sequence. Let me write down the first few terms:\n\nL_1 = 4\n\nL_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nL_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\n\nL_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\n\nL_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n\nL_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n\nL_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n\nL_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Then, the total expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this recursion mathematically. The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant, say L_n^p = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nC = 1 + 3*C\n\nSolving for C:\n\nC - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2.\n\nNow, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nTherefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me verify this formula with the earlier computed values.\n\nFor n=1: L_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27 -1=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 =29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*L_9 =3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the entire original expression in terms of this formula. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*L_9, and L_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nLet me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nTherefore, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572.\n\nSo, that confirms the result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series. Let me think.\n\nEach layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). If I expand this, it's like 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} for n layers. Wait, but in this case, each term is multiplied by 3, but also each term is preceded by a 1. Wait, perhaps it's similar to a geometric series but with each term being 1 + 3*(...).\n\nWait, but in our case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4, then 1 + 3*4=13, etc. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a linear recurrence as I did before.\n\nBut maybe I can find a closed-form formula for the entire expression.\n\nGiven that each layer is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, and L_1=4.\n\nAs we found earlier, L_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the outermost expression is 3*L_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2=(3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3.\n\nWait, let me try expanding the expression step by step.\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\nLet me denote E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me compute E step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses.\n\nCompute the innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, moving out one layer: 1 + 3*(4) =1 +12=13.\n\nNext layer:1 +3*13=1 +39=40.\n\nNext:1 +3*40=1 +120=121.\n\nNext:1 +3*121=1 +363=364.\n\nNext:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.\n\nNext:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.\n\nNext:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.\n\nNext:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.\n\nFinally, the outermost expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's the same result as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see this as a sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me try to expand the expression fully.\n\nE = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me expand this step by step, working from the innermost parentheses.\n\nLet me write it as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nLet me define each level:\n\nLevel 1: 1 + 3 =4\n\nLevel 2: 1 +3*Level1=1 +12=13\n\nLevel3:1 +3*Level2=1 +39=40\n\nLevel4:1 +3*Level3=1 +120=121\n\nLevel5:1 +3*Level4=1 +363=364\n\nLevel6:1 +3*Level5=1 +1092=1093\n\nLevel7:1 +3*Level6=1 +3279=3280\n\nLevel8:1 +3*Level7=1 +9840=9841\n\nLevel9:1 +3*Level8=1 +29523=29524\n\nThen, E=3*Level9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the earlier calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series. Let me see.\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, the expression is similar to 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n, but with each term being 1 + 3*(...). Wait, actually, in our case, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, expanding it, we get:\n\nE =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...)))).\n\nIf we expand this, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...)))).\n\nLet me expand it step by step:\n\nE =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\n\nLet me compute the innermost part first:\n\nStarting from the innermost 1 +3=4.\n\nThen, moving out, each layer is 1 +3*previous.\n\nSo, as we did before, each layer is 1 +3*previous, leading to 4,13,40,121,364,1093,3280,9841,29524.\n\nThen, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, but in this case, it's not exactly a geometric series because each term is 1 +3*something, which complicates things. However, we can see that each layer L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, which we've already solved as L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2.\n\nTherefore, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524.\n\nThen, E=3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the expression E as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with nine layers.\n\nIf we let E be the entire expression, then E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) where the inner part is similar to E itself but with one fewer layer.\n\nWait, but in this case, the expression isn't recursive in the same way because each layer is added step by step. Wait, actually, if I consider E to be the entire expression, then E =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with nine layers. But perhaps I can write a recursive formula for E.\n\nWait, but E is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with nine layers. Let me denote E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1=3*(1 +3)=3*4=12.\n\nE_2=3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(13)=39.\n\nWait, but that's not matching our earlier calculations. Wait, no, perhaps E_n is defined as 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with n layers.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If E_n is the expression with n layers, then E_n =3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with n layers. Then, E_{n} =3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}).\n\nWait, but in our problem, we have nine layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, E_9 =3*(1 +3*E_8).\n\nWait, but in our earlier approach, we had L_9 =1 +3*L_8, and E=3*L_9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps E_n =3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), with E_1=3*(1 +3)=12.\n\nWait, let's compute E_1=3*(1 +3)=3*4=12.\n\nE_2=3*(1 +3*E_1)=3*(1 +3*12)=3*(1 +36)=3*37=111.\n\nE_3=3*(1 +3*E_2)=3*(1 +3*111)=3*(1 +333)=3*334=1002.\n\nWait, but that's different from our earlier calculation where E was 88572. So, perhaps this approach is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the definitions here. Let me try again.\n\nIn our original problem, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) which has nine layers inside the outermost 3*(...).\n\nSo, if I define E_n as the expression with n layers, then E_n =3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), with E_1=3*(1 +3)=12.\n\nThen, E_2=3*(1 +3*E_1)=3*(1 +3*12)=3*(1 +36)=3*37=111.\n\nE_3=3*(1 +3*E_2)=3*(1 +3*111)=3*(1 +333)=3*334=1002.\n\nE_4=3*(1 +3*E_3)=3*(1 +3*1002)=3*(1 +3006)=3*3007=9021.\n\nWait, but earlier when we computed layer by layer, we had L_4=121, and then E=3*L_9=88572. So, these numbers don't match, which suggests that perhaps my definition of E_n is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the layers. Let me clarify: in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) So, the innermost part is 1 +3=4, then each layer is 1 +3*(previous), up to nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L_9), where L_9 is the result after nine layers.\n\nIn my previous approach, I defined L_n=1 +3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4, leading to L_9=29524, then E=3*L_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, in the E_n approach, I defined E_n=3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), starting from E_1=12, leading to E_2=111, etc. But in this case, E_1=12 corresponds to 3*(1 +3)=12, which is the same as L_1=4, then E_1=3*L_1=12.\n\nSimilarly, E_2=3*(1 +3*E_1)=3*(1 +36)=3*37=111, which is 3*(L_2=37). Wait, but in our earlier calculation, L_2=13, not 37. So, that suggests that E_n=3*L_n, where L_n is defined as 1 +3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4.\n\nWait, that makes sense because E_n=3*(1 +3*L_{n-1})=3*(L_n).\n\nWait, but in our original problem, the expression is E=3*(L_9), where L_9=29524.\n\nTherefore, E=3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the E_n approach, where E_n=3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), starting from E_1=12.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent with the L_n approach because E_n=3*(1 +3*E_{n-1})=3 +9*E_{n-1}.\n\nWait, let me compute E_1=3*(1 +3)=12.\n\nE_2=3*(1 +3*E_1)=3*(1 +36)=3*37=111.\n\nE_3=3*(1 +3*E_2)=3*(1 +333)=3*334=1002.\n\nE_4=3*(1 +3*E_3)=3*(1 +3006)=3*3007=9021.\n\nE_5=3*(1 +3*E_4)=3*(1 +27063)=3*27064=81192.\n\nWait, but this doesn't align with our earlier L_n approach. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake in defining E_n.\n\nWait, perhaps E_n in this case is not the same as 3*L_n. Let me check.\n\nFrom the L_n approach, L_n=1 +3*L_{n-1}, starting from L_1=4.\n\nSo, E=3*L_9=88572.\n\nFrom the E_n approach, E_n=3*(1 +3*E_{n-1}), starting from E_1=12.\n\nWait, perhaps these are two different sequences. Let me compute both up to n=2 to see.\n\nFrom L_n:\n\nL_1=4\n\nL_2=1 +3*4=13\n\nE=3*L_2=39\n\nFrom E_n:\n\nE_1=12\n\nE_2=3*(1 +3*12)=3*(1 +36)=3*37=111\n\nSo, E_2=111 vs 3*L_2=39.\n\nThese are different, which suggests that E_n is not the same as 3*L_n. Therefore, perhaps the E_n approach is not the right way to model this problem.\n\nTherefore, going back, the correct approach is to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, leading to L_9=29524, then E=3*L_9=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula L_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, we can compute L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, then E=3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's consistent across all methods, so I'm confident that's the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves computing a deeply nested expression with multiple layers of parentheses. By systematically evaluating each layer from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows a pattern that can be expressed using a recursive formula. This leads us to a closed-form solution involving powers of 3, allowing us to efficiently compute the final result without manually calculating each intermediate step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:**\n   The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\). There are nine such layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3.\n\n2. **Define Recursive Layers:**\n   Let \\(L_n\\) represent the value of the nth layer, starting from the innermost.

So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. So, Layer 2 is 13. Next, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me continue to see if this pattern holds. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, then 29400 + 123 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the final computation is 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that: 3*29000=87000, 3*524=1572. Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. Therefore, the result of the entire expression is 88572. Wait a second, let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Starting from Layer 1: 1+3=4, correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4=13, correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13=40, correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40=121, correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121=364, correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364=1093, correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093=3280, correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280=9841, correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841=29524, correct. Then, 3*29524=88572. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula or a pattern that I can recognize here, which might have saved me time instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let's denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the layers. So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recursive sequence where each term is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. So, if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n, that might help me compute it without going through each layer. Let's see if we can find a pattern or formula for L_n.\n\nLooking at the computed layers:\n\nL1 = 4\nL2 = 13\nL3 = 40\nL4 = 121\nL5 = 364\nL6 = 1093\nL7 = 3280\nL8 = 9841\nL9 = 29524\n\nHmm, let me see if these numbers follow a specific pattern. Let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\nL2 - L1 = 13 - 4 = 9\nL3 - L2 = 40 - 13 = 27\nL4 - L3 = 121 - 40 = 81\nL5 - L4 = 364 - 121 = 243\nL6 - L5 = 1093 - 364 = 729\nL7 - L6 = 3280 - 1093 = 2187\nL8 - L7 = 9841 - 3280 = 6561\nL9 - L8 = 29524 - 9841 = 19683\n\nWait a minute, those differences look familiar. 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, 2187, 6561, 19683. These are all powers of 3. Specifically:\n\n9 = 3^2\n27 = 3^3\n81 = 3^4\n243 = 3^5\n729 = 3^6\n2187 = 3^7\n6561 = 3^8\n19683 = 3^9\n\nSo, the difference between L_n and L_{n-1} is 3^{n+1}. That suggests that L_n can be expressed as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try to find a general formula for L_n.\n\nGiven that L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, and L1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nNow, we need a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution of the form A, where A is a constant.\n\nPlugging into the recurrence:\n\nA = 1 + 3*A\nA - 3*A = 1\n-2*A = 1\nA = -1/2\n\nWait, that seems odd because all our L_n are positive integers. Maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the particular solution should be of a different form. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, so the particular solution should indeed be a constant. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nAssume L_p = A.\n\nThen, L_p = 1 + 3*L_p => A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nHmm, that's correct, but it's negative, which doesn't align with our sequence. Maybe I need to adjust the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the general solution is the homogeneous solution plus the particular solution, so:\n\nL_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nBut when n=1, L1=4. Let's plug in n=1:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution would be:\n\nL_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me test this formula with n=1:\n\n(3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, which matches L1.\n\nn=2:\n\n(3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which matches L2.\n\nn=3:\n\n(3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40, which matches L3.\n\nn=4:\n\n(3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121, correct.\n\nn=5:\n\n(3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364, correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for Layer 9, which is the outermost layer, n=9:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524. Which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is 3 * L9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572, as I found before.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3 * L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147.\n\nThus, 3*L9 = (177147 -3)/2 =177144/2=88572. Same result.\n\nSo, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula, I arrive at the same answer. It's reassuring that both methods give the same result. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n\nI wonder if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by recognizing it as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that.\n\nLooking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))) with nine layers. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, if I denote the innermost term as T, then each layer is 1 + 3*T, and the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*T), and so on.\n\nBut since each layer is defined in terms of the next, it's a bit tricky to model it as a series. However, since I was able to find a closed-form formula for L_n, that was sufficient.\n\nAnother thought: The expression is similar to a continued fraction or a nested multiplication, where each step depends on the next. In this case, each step is linear, so it's a linear recurrence, which I was able to solve.\n\nI think I've explored this problem thoroughly, both by step-by-step computation and by finding a general formula. Both approaches confirm that the result is 88572. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that this is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the expression is \\boxed{88572}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\\), we start by recognizing the nested pattern and compute each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n   \\]\n\n3. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n   \\]\n\n5. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n   \\]\n\n6. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n   \\]\n\n7. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n   \\]\n\n8. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n   \\]\n\n9. Compute the next layer:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n   \\]\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[\n3 \\times 29524 = 88572\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)."

    "text": " Let me clarify: The innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me test this. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, the total is 88572. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because that seems a bit high. Maybe I made a mistake in one of the layers. Let me go through each layer step by step again to ensure accuracy. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. Now, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again: 29524 * 3. Breaking it down: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. So, yes, the result is 88572. Hmm, but let me think if there's a smarter way to compute this without having to go through each layer manually. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be applied here. Each layer seems to be following a recurrence relation. Let's denote L_n as the value at layer n, where L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} for n > 1. So, we can model this as a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. We know that L_1 = 4. Plugging into the equation: 4 = A*3^{1} + B => 3A + B = 4. Also, for the recurrence L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant, say B. Plugging into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. Now, using the initial condition: 3A + (-1/2) = 4 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. So, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. So, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That matches what I got earlier when computing each layer manually. Now, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, the final result is 88572. I think that's correct. Let me just cross-verify with another approach. Maybe using the formula for a geometric series. Since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. The formula I derived earlier seems to fit, and the step-by-step computation also aligns with it. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is of the form \\(1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)}\\).

    "text": " Let me check: The innermost parentheses is (1 + 3), right? Then moving outward, the next one is (1 + 3(1 + 3)), and so on. Hmm, perhaps I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me try that. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's straightforward. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Layer 3 is 40.

Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 Layer 8 is 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the final computation is: 3 * 29524 = Let me compute that. 29524 * 3.

So, putting it together: 88,572. Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication. 29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, so 2 with a carryover of 1. Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7. Next: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. Next: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. Next: 2*3=6 +2=8. So, the result is 88,572. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me verify using another method.

So, the final result is 88,572. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers. I started with Layer 1 as 4, then Layer 2 as 13, Layer 3 as 40, Layer 4 as 121, Layer 5 as 364, Layer 6 as 1093, Layer 7 as 3280, Layer 8 as 9841, Layer 9 as 29524. Then, multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. Let me check one of the layers again to see if I did the arithmetic correctly. For example, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. That's correct.

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step. Starting with Layer 1: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 Okay, that's simple enough. Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1. So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Got that. Now, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Hmm, okay, so each time, we're taking the previous layer, multiplying by 3, adding 1, and that becomes the next layer. Let me see if I can find a pattern here or if I need to compute each layer individually. Let's proceed step by step:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3 to get the final result. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I might have miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The expression is:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time we have a new set of parentheses, so let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1)\n2. 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 13 (Layer 2)\n3. 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 40 (Layer 3)\n4. 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 121 (Layer 4)\n5. 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 364 (Layer 5)\n6. 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1093 (Layer 6)\n7. 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 3280 (Layer 7)\n8. 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 9841 (Layer 8)\n9. 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524 (Layer 9)\n\nNow, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that.\n\n3 * 29524: Let's break it down. 29524 * 3.\n\nFirst, 20000 * 3 = 60,000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27,000\n\n500 * 3 = 1,500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check 29524 * 3 again.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 * 3:\n\n29,524\n*      3\n--------\n(4*3)=12, write down 2, carryover 1\n(2*3)=6 +1=7\n(5*3)=15, write down 5, carryover 1\n(9*3)=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2\n(2*3)=6 +2=8\nSo, writing it out:\n\n29,524 * 3 = 88,572\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my layers because I feel like I might have missed a step or miscalculated somewhere. Let me go through each layer again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, each layer seems correct. So, multiplying Layer 9 by 3 gives 88,572. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nAlternatively, I wonder if there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems similar to a geometric series or something that can be expressed recursively. Let me think about that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\na_1 = 4\n\na_2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\na_3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nAnd so on, up to a_9.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found, but since the problem only has 9 layers, computing each step is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 can be solved to find a closed-form expression.\n\nThe standard approach for solving such a linear recurrence is to find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nThus, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with n=1:\n\na_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2.\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. So, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 88,572.\n\nJust to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.\n\nMultiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nYep, that's solid. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be solved by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, we find that each layer follows the formula \\( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \\). Solving this recursively or using the closed-form formula \\( a_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\) for the nth layer, we compute the innermost layer and work our way out. Finally, multiplying the outermost layer by 3 gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Structure:** The expression is a nested sequence where each layer is of the form \\( 1 + 3 \\times \\text{(previous layer)} \\).\n\n2. **Compute Each Layer:**\n   - Layer 1: \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Layer 2: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13 \\)\n   - Layer 3: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40 \\)\n   - Layer 4: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121 \\)\n   - Layer 5: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364 \\)\n   - Layer 6: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093 \\)\n   - Layer 7: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280 \\)\n   - Layer 8: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841 \\)\n   - Layer 9: \\( 1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524 \\)\n\n3. **Multiply by 3:** The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so \\( 3 \\times 29524 = 88572 \\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me clarify. The innermost expression is Layer 9: 1 + 3. Then Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9), Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8), and so on, until Layer 1, which is the outermost part. Wait, no, actually, the way the expression is written, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: 1 + 3. Then Layer 8 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 9). Then Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8), etc., until Layer 1, which is the outermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1). Hmm, that seems a bit confusing, but let's try to work it out step by step. Let me write down each layer and compute it step by step. Starting from the innermost:\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nNow, Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\n\nWait, but the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1). So, the final result would be 3*29524. Let me compute that: 3*29524. Let's see, 29524 * 3. 29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, that's breaking it down incorrectly.

Let me go through each layer step by step again to ensure accuracy.\n\nStarting from Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(364). Let's compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(1093). Compute 1093*3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*(3280). Compute 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3*(9841). Compute 9841*3: Let's compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: 1 +3, then Layer 8 is 1 +3*(Layer9), up to Layer1, which is the outermost. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer1). So, I think I did it right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without having to compute each layer manually. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as L_1, then L_2, etc., up to L_9, and then the entire expression is 3*(L_9). Wait, no, that might be confusing. Let me try to model it as a recursive sequence. Let me define L_k as the value of the k-th layer, where k starts from 1 as the innermost. So L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Then L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13=40, and so on, up to L_9, which is the outermost layer. Then the entire expression is 3*(L_9). Wait, no, because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so the outermost layer is 3*(L_9), where L_9 is the 9th layer. Wait, but in my initial computation, I had Layer 9 as the innermost, which was 1 +3, then Layer8 as 1 +3*(Layer9), etc., up to Layer1 as the outermost, which was 1 +3*(Layer2), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer1). So, perhaps in this case, L_1 is the innermost, L_2 is the next, up to L_9 as the outermost, and the entire expression is 3*(L_9). Wait, but in my initial calculation, I had Layer9 as the innermost, which is L_1, and Layer8 as L_2, etc., up to Layer1 as L_9, and then the entire expression is 3*(L_9). Hmm, maybe I should adjust my notation to avoid confusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model each layer as a recurrence relation. Let's say that each layer L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 1 +3 =4. Then L_2 =1 +3*4=13, L_3=1 +3*13=40, and so on, up to L_9, and then the entire expression is 3*L_9.\n\nWait, that might be a better way. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, let me define L_1 = 4.\n\nThen, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 =1 + 3*4=13.\n\nL_3 =1 +3*L_2=1 +3*13=40.\n\nL_4=1 +3*L_3=1 +3*40=121.\n\nL_5=1 +3*L_4=1 +3*121=364.\n\nL_6=1 +3*L_5=1 +3*364=1093.\n\nL_7=1 +3*L_6=1 +3*1093=3280.\n\nL_8=1 +3*L_7=1 +3*3280=9841.\n\nL_9=1 +3*L_8=1 +3*9841=29524.\n\nThen the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before, so it seems consistent. So, perhaps the answer is 88572. But let me check if I made any calculation errors in each step.\n\nL_1=4.\n\nL_2=1+3*4=13.\n\nL_3=1+3*13=40.\n\nL_4=1+3*40=121.\n\nL_5=1+3*121=364.\n\nL_6=1+3*364=1093.\n\nL_7=1+3*1093=3280.\n\nL_8=1+3*3280=9841.\n\nL_9=1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen 3*29524=88572.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. Let me think about it. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1=4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = C. Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, using the formula, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*L_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, that's another way to compute it, using the formula derived from the recurrence relation. That's a bit more efficient, especially if the number of layers were larger, but for 9 layers, either method works.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the formula. The recurrence is L_n =1 +3*L_{n-1}, L_1=4. The homogeneous solution is indeed A*3^n, and the particular solution is a constant C, which we found to be -1/2. So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n -1/2. Applying L_1=4: 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 +1/2 = 3A => 9/2=3A => A=3/2. So, L_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10} -1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Then 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 3^{10}=59049, so 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524, multiplied by 3 is 88572.\n\nSo, either way, the result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me check the multiplication again just to be sure. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, that's not the right way to break it down. Let me do it digit by digit:\n\n29524\n\u00d7     3\n-------\nStarting from the right:\n4\u00d73=12, write down 2, carryover 1.\n2\u00d73=6 +1=7.\n5\u00d73=15, write down 5, carryover 1.\n9\u00d73=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n2\u00d73=6 +2=8.\nSo, the result is 88572. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 \u00d73: 29524 +29524=59048, plus another 29524: 59048 +29524=88572. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, how many layers are there? Let me count the opening parentheses after the initial 3: Each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the first 3(1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: After the initial 3, there's a 1+3(...), and each time another 1+3. Let me count the number of times \"1+3(\" occurs.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\n3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\n\nSo, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1+3), then each layer before that adds another 1+3. Let me see:\n\nThe innermost is (1+3), then moving outward, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:\n\nEach time I see a \"(\", it's a new layer. So, starting from the initial 3(, then each \"1+3(\" is a new layer. Let's count:\n\nAfter the initial 3(, there are 9 more \"1+3(\" instances before the closing parentheses start. So, that would mean there are 9 layers, each starting with 1+3(...). Therefore, the innermost is Layer 9: 1+3, then Layer8:1+3*(Layer9), up to Layer1:1+3*(Layer2), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer1). So, that's consistent with my earlier approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Wait, in the recurrence relation, each layer is 1 +3*L_{n-1}, which can be expressed as L_n =3*L_{n-1} +1. The solution to this recurrence is indeed (3^{n} -1)/2, but in our case, L_1=4, which corresponds to n=1: L_1=(3^{2}-1)/2= (9-1)/2=4. So, for n=9, L_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524, as we found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 3*(29524)=88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term. By working from the innermost parentheses outward and recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, we can compute each layer step by step. \n\n1. Compute the innermost layer:\n   Layer 9: \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n\n2. Compute each subsequent layer by substituting the previous result:\n   Layer 8: \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 13\\)\n   Layer 7: \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 40\\)\n   Layer 6: \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 121\\)\n   Layer 5: \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 364\\)\n   Layer 4: \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1093\\)\n   Layer 3: \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 3280\\)\n   Layer 2: \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 9841\\)\n   Layer 1: \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 29524\\)\n\n3. Multiply the outermost layer by 3:\n   \\(3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

    "text": " Let me try to compute each layer step by step.\n\nStarting with the innermost parentheses, Layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. So, Layer 1 = 4.\n\nNow, moving out one layer, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, Layer 2 = 13.\n\nNext, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2). Layer 2 is 13, so that's 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40.\n\nMoving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3). Layer 3 is 40, so 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Layer 4 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4). Layer 4 is 121, so 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5). Layer 5 is 364, so 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300 is 900, and 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Layer 6 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6). Layer 6 is 1093, so 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. Layer 7 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7). Layer 7 is 3280, so 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3000 = 9000, 3*280 = 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Layer 8 = 9841.\n\nFinally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 is 9841, so 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9000 = 27000, 3*800 = 2400, 3*41 = 123. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Layer 9 = 29524.\n\nWait a minute, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29000 = 87000, 3*524 = 1572. Adding those together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572.\n\nHmm, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to miscalculate with such large numbers. Let's go through each layer again:\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364 again. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. Adding up: 27000+2400=29400, +123=29523. 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let's compute that again. 3*29524:\n\nFirst, break it down:\n\n29524 * 3:\n\n20000 * 3 = 60000\n\n9000 * 3 = 27000\n\n500 * 3 = 1500\n\n20 * 3 = 60\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\nNow, add them up:\n\n60000 + 27000 = 87000\n\n87000 + 1500 = 88500\n\n88500 + 60 = 88560\n\n88560 + 12 = 88572\n\nSo, yes, 3*29524=88572.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, right? Let me count again. Starting from the innermost:\n\n1. (1+3)\n2. (1+3(...))\n3. And so on until the ninth layer.\n\nYes, so each Layer 1 through 9 corresponds to each set. So, computing each layer up to 9 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern in the layers to find a formula, but since there are only nine layers, computing each step is manageable.\n\nAnother way to approach it is to recognize that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Let's see if there's a pattern or a formula for a_n.\n\nThe recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it.\n\nFirst, the homogeneous solution: The equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1.\n\nThe characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A\n\nSolving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2.\n\nTherefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the layers I computed earlier.\n\nFor n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula works. Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 88572.\n\nI think that's solid. I double-checked each layer, used the formula to confirm, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression with nine layers, each of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). By computing each layer step by step from the innermost to the outermost, we find that each layer follows the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. Solving this recurrence, we find a general formula and compute the outermost layer, then multiply by 3 to get the final result.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the structure**: The expression is a nested sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term), starting from the innermost (1 + 3).\n\n2. **Compute each layer**:\n   - Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n   - Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n   - Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n   - Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n   - Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n   - Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n   - Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n   - Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\n3. **Multiply by 3**: The entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, so 3 * 29524 = 88572.\n\n**Answer**: $\\boxed{88572}$"

    "text": " Let me confirm: The innermost part is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost. But wait, actually, counting the parentheses, I think there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me check: Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3, then each next layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, if I count each opening parenthesis, there are nine of them. So, yes, nine layers. So, to compute this, I should compute Layer 1 first, then use that result to compute Layer 2, and so on, until I get to Layer 9, and then multiply by 3 as per the original expression. Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, once I compute Layer 9, I multiply by 3 to get the final result. Let me write this down step by step.\n\nFirst, compute Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThen, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524.\n\nWait, hold on, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because the numbers are getting large quickly, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go through each layer again carefully.\n\nLayer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct.\n\nLayer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct.\n\nLayer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct.\n\nLayer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct.\n\nLayer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct.\n\nLayer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total is 900+192=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct.\n\nLayer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct.\n\nLayer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct.\n\nLayer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120=29520, plus 3=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct.\n\nSo, Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. Let's compute that.\n\nCompute 3*29524:\n\nFirst, 3*20000=60000.\n\n3*9000=27000.\n\n3*500=1500.\n\n3*20=60.\n\n3*4=12.\n\nWait, but that's breaking it down into parts. Alternatively, let's compute 29524*3:\n\n24*3=72, write down 2, carryover 7.\n\n2*3=6 +7=13, write down 3, carryover 1.\n\n5*3=15 +1=16, write down 6, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8.\n\nSo, 29524*3=88572.\n\nWait, let me verify that:\n\n29524\nx    3\n-------\n88572\n\nYes, because 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1.\n\n2*3=6 +1=7.\n\n5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1.\n\n9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2.\n\n2*3=6 +2=8.\n\nSo, yes, 88572.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 88572.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Because the original expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524=88572.\n\nIs that correct? Let me check with another method. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 as (30000 - 476)*3 = 90000 - 1428= 88572. Yes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, 29524 *3:\n\n29524\nx    3\n--------\n(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 +4)*3\n=60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 +12\n=60000+27000=87000\n87000+1500=88500\n88500+60=88560\n88560+12=88572. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the final answer is 88572.\n\nBut wait a second, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) Let's count the number of 1+3(...) inside each other. Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each next layer wraps around that. So, how many layers are there?\n\nLet me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1+3. Wait, no, perhaps better to count the number of 1+3 terms. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1+3=4.\n\nThen Layer 2: 1+3*4=13.\n\nLayer 3: 1+3*13=40.\n\nLayer 4: 1+3*40=121.\n\nLayer 5: 1+3*121=364.\n\nLayer 6: 1+3*364=1093.\n\nLayer 7: 1+3*1093=3280.\n\nLayer 8: 1+3*3280=9841.\n\nLayer 9: 1+3*9841=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9)=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. Let me think about it. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=4.\n\nThis is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found, but since it's a simple one, maybe we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nThe recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.\n\nThis is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the solution a_n = C*3^n.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3*A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2.\n\nUsing the initial condition a_1=4:\n\n4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the general formula is a_n= (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2.\n\nSimplify: a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (243-1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (729-1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.\n\nn=6: (2187-1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct.\n\nn=7: (6561-1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct.\n\nn=8: (19683-1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct.\n\nn=9: (59049-1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nYes, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9=29524.\n\nThen, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572.\n\nSo, the answer is 88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then 3*a_n=3*(3^{n+1}-1)/2=(3^{n+2}-3)/2.\n\nBut in our case, n=9, so 3*a_9=(3^{11}-3)/2.\n\nCompute 3^{11}=177147.\n\nSo, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. Correct.\n\nTherefore, using the formula, we can directly compute it as (3^{11}-3)/2=88572.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nSo, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a general formula, I can confidently say that the result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe given expression is a nested structure that can be evaluated by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous layer). By calculating each layer step by step, we find that the innermost layer evaluates to 4, and each subsequent layer builds on this result. After computing all nine layers, we multiply the final result by 3 to obtain the solution.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Layer 1**: 1 + 3 = 4\n2. **Layer 2**: 1 + 3*4 = 13\n3. **Layer 3**: 1 + 3*13 = 40\n4. **Layer 4**: 1 + 3*40 = 121\n5. **Layer 5**: 1 + 3*121 = 364\n6. **Layer 6**: 1 + 3*364 = 1093\n7. **Layer 7**: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\n8. **Layer 8**: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\n9. **Layer 9**: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\n\nFinally, multiply Layer 9 by 3:\n\n3 * 29524 = 88572\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{88572}"

Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3 times Layer 1, so: Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 Hmm, that's 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 Okay, so Layer 3 is 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 So Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 That's 364 for Layer 5. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. So Layer 6 is 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. So Layer 7 is 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Thus, Layer 8 is 1 + 9840 = 9841. Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. So Layer 9 is 1 + 29523 = 29524.

Okay, Layer 2 is 13. Moving on to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13, which is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, Layer 3 is 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me see if this continues. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5 is 364.

Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Layer 9 is 29524. Now, wait a second. The original expression is 3 times Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. 3*29524. Breaking it down: 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*20 = 60, and 3*4 = 12.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here that I can recognize, so I don't have to compute each layer step by step. Let me think about it.\n\nLooking at the layers, each layer is defined by Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). This looks like a recursive sequence where each term is based on the previous one. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n.\n\nLet's consider the recursive relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2.\n\nSo, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2).\n\nNow, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4:\n\n4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nSo, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.\n\nLet me check this formula with the earlier layers:\n\nFor n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.\n\nn=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.\n\nn=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct.\n\nn=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364.

Correct.\n\nn=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula works. Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula, if I wanted to compute the outermost expression directly, which is 3*(Layer 9). Let's see if we can express the entire expression in terms of n layers.\n\nWait, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Using the formula for Layer 9, which is (3^{10} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*((3^{10} -1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2.\n\nWait, let me compute 3^{11}:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^{10}=59049\n\n3^{11}=177147\n\nSo, 3^{11}=177147\n\nThen, (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572.\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572.\n\nTherefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer.

Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply that result by 3.\n\nSo, the final result would be 3 * 29524.\n\nLet me compute that: 29524 * 3. Hmm, 29,524 * 3. Let me break it down:\n\n29,524 * 3:\n- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000\n- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000\n- 500 * 3 = 1,500\n- 20 * 3 = 60\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n\nAdding those up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000\n87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500\n88,500 + 60 = 88,560\n88,560 + 12 = 88,572\n\nSo, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572.\n\nTherefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to make an error when dealing with so many layers.\n\nStarting from Layer 1:\n1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 2:\n1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 3:\n1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 4:\n1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 5:\n1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 6:\n1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 7:\n1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 8:\n1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLayer 9:\n1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThen, 3*29524 = 88,572 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nHmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that.\n\nEach layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, then:\n\nL1 = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nL2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\n\nL3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis seems like a recurrence relation where each term depends on the previous one. Maybe I can find a general formula for Ln.\n\nLooking at the recurrence: Ln = 1 + 3*Ln-1\n\nThis is a linear recurrence relation, and I can solve it to find a closed-form expression.\n\nFirst, let's write the recurrence:\n\nLn = 1 + 3*Ln-1\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = A*3^n, where A is a constant.\n\nNow, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L^p.\n\nSubstituting into the recurrence:\n\nL^p = 1 + 3*L^p\n\nSubtract 3*L^p from both sides:\n\nL^p - 3*L^p = 1\n\n-2*L^p = 1\n\nL^p = -1/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nLn = Ln^h + L^p = A*3^n - 1/2\n\nNow, we can use the initial condition to find A. Let's see, when n=1, L1=4.\n\nSo, substituting n=1:\n\n4 = A*3^1 - 1/2\n\n4 = 3A - 1/2\n\nAdding 1/2 to both sides:\n\n4 + 1/2 = 3A\n\n9/2 = 3A\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nA = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\n\nSo, A = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\nLn = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2\n\nWe can factor out 1/2:\n\nLn = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nSo, for each layer n, Ln = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\n\nTherefore, Layer 9 would be:\n\nL9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2\n\nCompute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049\n\nSo, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\n\nWhich matches the earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88,572\n\nSo, that's another way to confirm the result without computing each layer step by step. It's interesting that the closed-form formula gives the same result as the iterative method. So, that makes me more confident that 88,572 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to see this as a geometric series. Let me explore that.\n\nLooking back at the original expression:\n\n3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nIf I expand this expression, it would be:\n\n3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\n\nEach time, we're adding 1 and multiplying by 3. If I think about expanding all of these, it's similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but with an additional 1 added each layer. Hmm, not sure if that's the right way to think about it, but the recurrence approach worked earlier.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost layer and working outwards, each time substituting the value of the inner layer into the outer one.\n\nWait, but that's essentially what I did earlier when computing each Layer 1 through Layer 9. So, maybe the iterative approach is the most straightforward here.\n\nAlternatively, since we found a general formula for Ln, we can use that to compute any layer directly. So, for n=9, we have L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and then multiplying by 3 gives the final result.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me compute 3^{10} again.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Yep, that all checks out.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. So, the final answer is 88,572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing a nested expression with multiple layers. By recognizing the pattern and using a recurrence relation, we can determine each layer's value step by step. The innermost layer is computed first, and each subsequent layer uses the previous result. The general formula for each layer is derived as \\( L_n = \\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \\). For the outermost layer, this gives 29,524. Multiplying by 3 yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{88572}"

So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Let's compute that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. So Layer 3 is 40. Moving on to Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4 is 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 121*3. Hmm, 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. So Layer 5 is 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. Well, 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. So Layer 6 is 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. So Layer 7 is 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. Adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. So Layer 8 is 9841. Now, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So Layer 9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the outermost part is 3*(...). So, the final computation is 3*29524. Let's calculate that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12. Now, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer was 1 + 3 times the previous result.

So, the final result is 88572.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is a nested expression where each layer is computed step by step starting from the innermost parentheses.

Layer 2 is 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, Layer 3 = 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Let me continue to see if this pattern holds. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, Layer 4 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Layer 5 = 364.

Finally, Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. So, Layer 9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9, right? Because the original problem is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, let me check that again. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. Therefore, the final step is to compute 3 * 29524. Let me calculate that. 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: 20000*3 = 60000, 9000*3 = 27000, 500*3 = 1500, 20*3 = 60, 4*3 = 12.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). This is a recursive sequence. Let me denote L(n) as the value of layer n. Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). With L(1) = 4. This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. Let's solve for A and B. Given L(1) = 4, and L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1). Let's plug in n=1: L(1) = 1 + 3*L(0). Wait, but L(0) isn't defined here. Hmm, maybe it's better to write the homogeneous and particular solutions. The recurrence is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant, let's assume L_p(n) = K, a constant. Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. Therefore, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. Applying the initial condition L(1) = 4: 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. Therefore, L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Let me verify this formula with the layers I computed earlier. For n=1: L(1) = (3^(2) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. For n=2: L(2) = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. For n=3: L(3) = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for layer n, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. Since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is L(9). So, L(9) = (3^(10) - 1)/2. Let's compute that: 3^10 is 59049. Therefore, L(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the value I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Alternatively, recognizing the pattern early on could have saved time, but since I was able to compute each layer step by step without error, that's also a valid approach. I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the expression \\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward.\n\n1. **Layer 1:** \\(1 + 3 = 4\\)\n2. **Layer 2:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\\)\n3. **Layer 3:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\\)\n4. **Layer 4:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\\)\n5. **Layer 5:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\\)\n6. **Layer 6:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\\)\n7. **Layer 7:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\\)\n8. **Layer 8:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\\)\n9. **Layer 9:** \\(1 + 3 \\times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\\)\n\nFinally, multiply the result by 3:\n\\[3 \\times 29524 = 88572\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{88572}\\)"
